0,"Also: DeKalb County region on track to qualify for Phase 3 re-opening pending testing metrics By Daily Chronicle Mark Black for Shaw Media Caption Vehicles funnel into three testing bays at the Illinois run drive-through COVID-19 testing facility, managed by the Illinois National Guard, at the Chicago Premium Outlets mall in Aurora. The site quickly reached capacity within less than an hour on the second full day of operation in Aurora Apr. 24. Mark Busch – mbusch@shawmedia.com Caption Sam Cohn, a server at The Junction Eating Place, wipes down the counter Sunday at the eatery on West Lincoln Highway in DeKalb. Mark Busch file photo – mbusch@shawmedia.com Caption For the fourth time in the past five days, the DeKalb County Health Department has reported no new coronavirus cases locally, leaving the county as of Monday at 36, including one death. As a public service, Shaw Media will provide open access to information related to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) emergency. Sign up for the newsletter here.  SYCAMORE – Nine more DeKalb County residents have tested positive for the novel coronavirus Monday, according to the DeKalb County Health Department , bringing the total to 193 positive cases reported to date..  New cases include another resident under 19, four in their 30s, two in their 40s, and one each in their 50s and 70s. In total, 68 have recovered as of Friday, and two residents have died..  Where we stand with Restore Illinois metrics.  According to newly updated Restore Illinois data which tracks testing, hospital and medical supply availability in regions to determine whether certain businesses and services throughout the state can begin to reopen, DeKalb County's region remains within certain criteria to move forward to Phase 3 of Gov. JB Pritzker's plan at the end of May..  Illinois is in Phase 2 of the five-phase plan. In particular, the North Central Region (which includes DeKalb County) is reporting an 8.96% positive rate, which falls under the threshold for positive cases which must be 20% or lower than the number of tests performed for a 14-day consecutive period. According to IDPH data, the region has been tracking that way since May 1..  In order to move to Phase 3, the region would also would need to go 28 days without an overall increase in COVID-19 hospital admissions, and have at least 14% of all hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators available for surge capacity..  The region reports 41% of ICU beds are available and 60% of ventilators are available as of May 8, the most recent available data..  Other criteria to move forward to Phase 3, however, such as robust testing and contact tracing, are still unclear, as no guidelines have yet been laid out on metrics from the Illinois Department of Public Health..  Local COVID-cases, testing data.  Including the new cases, there have been nine COVID-19 occurrences in residents younger than age 19, and 37 in residents in their 20s, with 42 in their 30s, 41 in their 40s, 40 in their 50s, nine in their 60s, 13 in their 70s and two in their 80s..  The two deaths reported in the county were both men; one a resident in his 50s, announced April 6, and one in his 60s , announced Saturday..  The Illinois Department of Public Health lists cases and tests by ZIP code, while the county health department lists cases by municipality. The 60135 ZIP code, which includes Genoa, has 19 confirmed cases and 128 tests administered. The 60115 ZIP code went up to 66 cases and 678 tests, while the 60178 ZIP code has 22 confirmed cases and 308 tests..  As of Monday, a total of 79,007 cases have been confirmed statewide, with 3,459 deaths and 442,425 tests performed, according to the IDPH..  Data from the state health department released Sunday afternoon also shows that 1,563 COVID-19 tests have been conducted in DeKalb County (which has a population of about 105,000 according to the 2010 Census) to date. As of Friday, 1,393 of those tests have come back negative..  The city of DeKalb is reported to have between 66 and 70 cases. Sandwich has between 26 and 30 cases. Sycamore and Genoa each report between 21 and 25. Cortland reports between 16 and 20 cases, while Kingston is reported to have between six and 10 cases. Kirkland, Esmond, Malta, Maple Park, Hinckley, Shabbona, Somonauk and Waterman each report between one and five cases..  COVID-19 testing is being conducted at Northwestern Medicine health system hospitals and private lab facilities, including through Physicians Immediate Care and the Center for Family Health in Sycamore , which are prioritizing high-risk patients, first responders and health care workers and those experiencing severe symptoms.

1,"The good news: Terry Link quit his job..  The bad news: Not fast enough..  Let’s review: On Aug. 13, federal prosecutors charged then-state Sen. Link, D-Indian Creek, with filing a false income tax return in 2016. Link had been in the senate since 1997, shortly before his 50th birthday. Five years earlier he won election as chairman of the Democratic Party of Lake County. He finished third in a 2013 mayoral primary in Waukegan, but continued to crusade for bringing a casino to the region and was chairman of the Senate Gaming Committee..  On the day the indictment dropped, Link resigned from the Legislative Ethics Commission. Soon thereafter he said he’d relinquish his county chairmanship on Sept. 15, but soon advanced that timetable once party leaders made it known they convene Aug. 31 to formally remove him..  The stated concern was clear: If Link quit the Senate after Sept. 11 but before Sept. 15, he could effectively name his replacement. Under current state law, a legislative resignation on Sept. 12 or later wouldn’t be put to voters — despite a looming election —because there are fewer than 28 months in Link’s term. That means party leaders in the district appoint a replacement, and Link held sufficient power given the 30th district is almost entirely north of Lake Cook Road..  (The 30th yin-yangs nicely with the 26th District of Sen. Dan McConchie, R-Hawthorn Woods. He and Link are practically neighbors relative to the far-flung nature of their constituents. But that’s all likely to change with the results of this year’s Census. Anyway…).  So Link left the county party earlier than originally promised. Good. But he retained his Senate seat. Bad. On Sept. 11 he formally announced he’d resign the next day. That wasn’t just a Saturday, it was the first day Link could quit without triggering a special election..  Former state Rep. Lauren Beth Gash now runs the county party. She’ll convene with state Rep. Mark Walker, also a Wheeling Township Democratic committeeman, and they’ll name Link’s replacement by Oct. 12. Gash’s GOP counterpart, Mark Shaw, released a blistering statement accusing Link and Gash of scheming, “While the rest of the nation was honoring the victims and heroes of 9/11 … to abuse Illinois State election law loopholes.”.  Strictly concerning timing, Shaw is right: this stinks for anyone who supports voter choice. Link is far from the first lawmaker to employ this strategy. All House vacancies are filled by partisan appointment, because the 1970 state Constitution framers apparently abhorred special elections..  While voters await an ethics commission’s legislative recommendations, here’s hoping addressing such loopholes is on the list. Link’s public days are over, but legislators will continue to follow this sketchy playbook..  • Scott T. Holland writes about state government issues for Shaw Media Illinois.

2,"Small businesses are the heart of our neighborhoods. Jobs that are created by small businesses are what keep our communities thriving. My name is Chris Plywacz and I am the proud owner of Reeg Plumbing , a small business in the western suburbs. I’m not a millionaire, nor am I a billionaire. Far from it. SEND LETTERS TO: . Please include your neighborhood or hometown and a phone number for verification purposes. I started my career right after high school, entering the trades. I eventually was able to purchase the company I worked for with the help of the Obama Administration’s Small Business Administration loan program. I am very proud that I have grown this company and now help provide jobs for other people just like me. My employees work hard. They know they have good-paying jobs, and they provide safety and security for their families. I am very concerned about the graduated income tax amendment on the ballot on Nov. 3 and the potential negative effect on my business and employees. I am a Democrat, and I know the amendment is being pushed by our governor; but increasing taxes and the high cost of living in Illinois doesn’t have a political party. So, I did some research. First of all, Illinois already has some of the highest taxes in the country — and we rank second highest for property taxes. Our state already is losing people and businesses because of our high tax burden. If this constitutional amendment passes, even more people, businesses and jobs will leave our state. It’s important to note that Illinois has seen six straight years of population decline. That directly affects blue collar jobs like mine and the ones I provide. Now, what really gets me is that this initial tax hike immediately will affect more than 100,000 small business owners, but it increases the tax rate on large corporations by just 10 %. And there really is no real tax relief for working poor and middle-class families. In fact, it is less than $3 per month for someone making $25,000 a year. This amendment will give a big foot to Springfield politicians to step on small businesses like mine and diminish opportunities for us to create jobs or even expand our businesses. Larger employers that provide goods and services will be hit with even higher taxes; the products they produce will go up in cost. I will be paying more for the products I need for my plumbing company and will have to make up the difference in potentially cutting wages or even jobs — something I do not want to do. Many of my customers have left this state because of our taxes. And our future is not guaranteed, either. Taxes could go even higher, and taxing retirement income becomes a greater possibility. That is not what hard working men and women in this state want to hear. I was fortunate enough to be able to buy my business. If anyone, right now, is looking at starting a new small business in this state, and this graduated income tax amendment is looming, they are going to think twice. And, they may even go to another state. If we don’t stop this amendment, the future for small businesses like mine, is bleak. After years of tax hikes, people fleeing the state and trying to weather a pandemic, Illinois is on the brink of collapse. I can’t think of a worse time to raise taxes.

3,"1 / 4 Goodbye, New York, California and Illinois. Hello … Where? (Bloomberg Opinion) -- New York, California and Illinois have been hemorrhaging residents. Almost 3.2 million more people left those states for elsewhere in the U.S. than arrived from other states, from 2010 through 2019, according to population estimates released last week by the Census Bureau. Nine other states saw net out-migration of more than 100,000 people over that period, but none really came close to the big three..  Thanks to 2 million more births than deaths and 1 million newcomers from other countries, California’s population still grew by about 2 million over this period, a gain that trailed only those of Texas and Florida. New York’s population grew but only slightly, while Illinois lost an estimated 159,751 people between 2010 and 2019. Yes, these are all big states, but New York and Illinois ranked second and third in net domestic migration as percentage of 2010 population, behind only Alaska (California ranked 13th)..  Where are all these people going? The Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative Albany think tank, put together some estimates for New York based on data that the Internal Revenue Service gleans from tax returns. (The Census Bureau also releases data on state-to-state migration flows, but those are based on surveys with sometimes-large margins of error, so the IRS numbers are more reliable if less complete.) This inspired me to do the same for California and Illinois. Here are the Empire Center’s numbers for New York:.  The adjusted gross income of New York taxpayers who didn’t migrate averaged $88,940 from 2012 through 2018. Those who left for Florida, New Jersey, California and Connecticut made more money than that; those who moved to other states in the top 10 less, in some cases much less. By far the most affluent group of migrants from New York was the 1,309 taxpayers who moved to Wyoming, who had an average income of $179,014..  Here’s where Californians have been heading..  The adjusted gross income of California taxpayers who didn’t migrate averaged $84,641, and migrants to all of the top-10 states made less than that. Also notable in California’s case is that it experienced net inflows from about half the states, including New York and Illinois. It’s losing residents in huge numbers to nearby states, but still attracting people from the Northeast and Midwest..  Finally, here’s where Illinoisans (Illinoians?) have been going..  The adjusted gross income of Illinois taxpayers who didn’t migrate averaged $78,959. Illinois has been losing high-income residents (a lot of them retirees, one imagines) to Florida, middle-income residents to the South and West, and those with lower incomes to neighboring states. Also, the top two destinations for Illinois migrants are the top two for the nation as a whole, with Florida first, Texas second..  Domestic migration statistics are frequently cited as evidence of the failures of blue-state governance, in particular the higher taxes imposed by states that are losing lots of residents. There’s something to that — income-tax-free Florida sure is attracting a lot of affluent people from Illinois and New York, and a recent study of high-income California taxpayers concluded that a 2012 income tax increase there did in fact drive some away. But California, Illinois and New York have all experienced bigger per capita personal income gains than the nation as a whole since the beginning of 2010, and all saw taxpayers with incomes below $50,000 overrepresented among the leavers from 2011 through 2018. These departures may indicate failures of governance as well, but it’s a different set of governance failures, presumably related more to housing costs, commutes and job opportunities than taxes per se..  There also isn’t much evidence in the IRS data — yet — of an exodus of high-income taxpayers hit by the state-and-local-tax-deduction limits imposed by the 2017 tax bill. That is, the number of taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 or more leaving for other states actually fell in high-tax California, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey and New York from 2017 to 2018, the year the cap went into effect. Those who ended up with higher tax bills due to the change generally didn’t find out exactly how much higher until 2019, though, so it may just be too early to tell.","[0.5023202300071716, 0.49767979979515076]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5023202300071716

6,"Remodeling how Illinois’ political districts are drawn is the key to addressing the “dark cloud” of ethical violations hovering over state government, House Republican leaders said Tuesday..  Communities are grouped “primarily for political advantage,” Dixon Republican Rep. Tom Demmer said, restricting residents’ ability to hold their legislators accountable..  “These political entrenchments — these situations in which politicians pick their voters instead of voters picking their politicians — had a chilling impact on our ability to debate the important issues of the day here in Springfield,” he added..  One of those is redistricting reform, an issue the House Republican caucus is prioritizing this session and has supported for years. It will “stop” the culture that enabled unscrupulous behavior by some lawmakers over the past year and “devastated the state,” Minority Leader Jim Durkin, from Western Springs, said..  Villa Park Democratic Sen. Tom Cullerton was formally accused by a federal grand jury of collecting a salary as well as health and pension benefits from a labor union for work he did not do. He has pleaded not guilty..  Federal officials charged former Rep. Luis Arroyo, a Chicago Democrat, with bribery, charges that led him to relinquish his post..  And former Sen. Martin Sandoval, a Democrat from Chicago, pleaded guilty to federal bribery and tax evasion charges in a federal court in Chicago on Tuesday. He resigned effective Jan. 1. × Former Illinois state Sen. Sandoval pleads guilty to bribery and tax fraud.  Changing the method by which political maps are drawn “is probably the most important way we can clean up corruption and the culture that has created this horrible situation in Illinois,” Durkin said..  All 44 House GOP members support a constitutional amendment that would remove politicians from deciding the boundaries of districts in favor of an 11-member commission tasked with drawing maps in a “fair, above-board way,” Demmer said. It would affect boundaries of districts drawn after the 2020 census..  “The proposal for fair maps has been out there for years, and it’s one of the most thoroughly-discussed issues we’ve seen,” he said..  House Republicans are also pushing for legislation reforming lawmaker behavior. Rep. Grant Wehlri, from Naperville, said those “common sense measures” include prohibiting representatives and senators from being lobbyists while in office, preventing them from immediately becoming lobbyists after leaving their post and increasing the economic interest information legislators have to disclose..  “If the Democrats finally wanted to get serious on holding themselves accountable and do what’s right for the people of Illinois, let’s move these pieces of legislation,” he said..  Durkin appeared to put the success of those changes, and others, on Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker..  “I think as leader of the party, he can get his members in line. That includes the (House) speaker (Chicago Democrat Michael Madigan) and also the president of the Senate (Oak Park Democrat Don Harmon) ...” he said..  His caucus is also planning to combat the “skyrocketing cost of property taxes” in Illinois, Rep. Dan Brady, R-Bloomington, said.

7,"Home price growth stalled last fall in the Chicago area..  The region’s single-family home values grew by 0.4 percent in November from a year earlier, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices released this morning. It was the third straight month of growth so slender it’s essentially flat: October’s figure was 0.5 percent; September’s was 0.6 percent..  In the index’s Chicago data going back to February 1988, there is no other span of three months when home prices grew by less than 1 percent, except when they were negative in years after the housing bust of the mid-2000s..  In the November report, Chicago’s home price growth was the weakest among the 20 major U.S. cities that the index tracks. In some months of 2019, both San Francisco and Seattle went negative as their overheated housing markets cooled off, but in November both were positive, with San Francisco’s prices up 0.5 percent and Seattle’s up 3.3 percent..  Nationwide, according to the index, home values were up 3.5 percent, or nearly nine times the Chicago figure. For much of 2018 and 2019, Chicago home price growth was running at about half the national rate: first in the 3 percent range when the nation was at 6, and in the cool-down that began in February 2019, Chicago was at around 1.5 percent when the nation was at 3..  The gap is wide between Chicago’s housing market and the nation’s. At the November index level, local values were about 13 percent below their September 2006 peak. Nationwide, home prices were about 15 percent above their old peak..  There’s a familiar litany of reasons for Chicago’s slowdown: population loss that slows demand for homes, decreasing the need to bid prices up; high property taxes and the uncertainty about how much more they’ll go up, which causes some homebuyers to curtail the price they pay in order to keep the total cost of homeownership from growing fast, and the lack of an economic boom like the tech business that has boosted home values in places like San Francisco and Seattle..  Note that the index lags behind market reports by Illinois Realtors, which last week released data showing a big increase in home prices in December. It’s likely Case-Shiller’s report that comes out in late February will show a similar change, although it may not be quite as steep an increase, as the two reports use different methodologies. The trade association reports the prices of all homes sold in a month, while the index compares individual homes to their past sale prices..  “Chicago is still seeing home prices rise, albeit at a softer pace compared to the nation’s largest markets,"" Bill Banfield, Quicken Loans chief risk officer, said in an email to Crain's after the data was released this morning.

8,"By Shirin Ali Medill Reports Thousands of people gathered in Grant Park on Saturday to march for climate change solutions, reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights and getting out the vote, issues highlighted at the annual Women’s March since the 2016 election of President Donald Trump..  Women’s March Chicago organized the event and estimated that 10,000 people participated this year. Despite rain and snow, marchers rallied with enthusiasm and zeal with their, chanting, hoisting homemade signs and wearing pink hats..  Jill Conrad drove more than 80 miles from Ottawa to attend and many people arrived from out of state. Conrad carried a vibrant blue banner that read “Any Functioning Adult 2020,” a message that garnered lots of thumbs up as people snapped picture. Conrad described the experience as one filled with “lots of good ideas.”.  Summing up the protest, she said “It was a great day” and the best part was seeing the unity among the marchers, she said. “It’s good to see people out here together, men and women, black, white, all of [us]. That was the high point.” About 10,000 people gathered in Grant Park for the fourth annual Women’s March on Jan. 18, the anniversary of the first march held in 2017 to protest the election of Donald Trump as president. The march signifies an effort to bring awareness to important issues such as immigration, voting rights and health care as well as reproductive rights. Women’s March Chicago organized the Jan. 18 march, which kicked off in Grant Park, crowding down Adams Street as marchers headed west from the park. During Chicago’s 2017 inaugural Women’s March, an estimated 250,000 people attended. Marchers and other attendees noticed the smaller crowd this year. Shaun Stephan, a vendor who has been selling women’s march merchandise since the movement’s inception, said he felt the cold, snowy weather contributed to the lowered participation. But the passion matched previous years, he said. “It’s still strong, and I think there’s a lot of passion and emotion when it comes to showing everybody’s here for women’s rights.” Despite 20-degree temperatures with a mix of rain and snow in the forecast, marchers came prepared. Dressed in hats, scarves, gloves and snow boots, they walked and chanted, “Donald Trump has got to go!” Marchers made their way to Federal Plaza at Adams and Clark Streets. Women’s March Chicago recognized five major concerns to address during this year’s march: the 2020 census, taking control of climate change, gun violence prevention, women’s health rights and getting out the vote. As marchers moved through the city, these issues along with many others carried their weight with lots of handmade signs, banners and chants. Chicago police lined the route, some riding horses or bikes and some on foot, helping to guide traffic and marchers. Mother-daughter duo Katie and Heidi Ramirez made the trek from the western suburbs to participate in this year’s women’s march. They said they are marching for a host of issues including climate change, female reproductive rights, voting rights and immigration reform. They handmade custom ponchos to match their homemade signs. Chicago native Ellen Pinkham has attended the women’s march since its inception in 2017. She marches with her Trump puppet every year. She said she supports the current impeachment effort against the president and was marching for more change in Washington. “We really need new people in the government, we just have to get rid of these people who do not have the best interests of the large majority of people of the country at heart.” From left to right: Debbie Cavult, of Kildeer; Samantha Saunders, of Elmwood Park; Sheil Davis, of Kildeer, and Marietta Sorendo, of Bloomingdale all marched together and were thrilled to be a part of the movement. They felt the march created a strong sense of community. “Sometimes when you’re alone in the suburbs you think, ‘Oh, everybody’s Republican, everybody likes this idiot.’ But here, you can feel like you’re part of a group.” From right to left: Isabella Murk, 20, Sophie Murk, 24, Rachael Caise, 29, Emma Faith, 22, and Alissa Pienkowski, 30, were all young, first-time marchers at this year’s event. They expressed their excitement at participating in the movement and drawing together with the crowd, Demonstrators from the organization Refuse Fascism wrap up their banner at Federal Plaza as the march comes to a close. Women’s March Chicago has organized four mass marches to date. It’s mission is to advocate for women’s rights, promote intersectional feminism and challenge the political system regarding issues affecting women. Women’s March Chicago is planning its next event in March, to get out the vote for the Illinois primary elections.

SPRINGFIELD — Remodeling how Illinois’ political districts are drawn is the key to addressing the “dark cloud” of ethical violations hovering over state government, House Republican leaders said Tuesday..  Communities are grouped “primarily for political advantage,” Dixon Republican Rep. Tom Demmer said, restricting residents’ ability to hold their legislators accountable..  “These political entrenchments — these situations in which politicians pick their voters instead of voters picking their politicians — had a chilling impact on our ability to debate the important issues of the day here in Springfield,” he added..  One of those is redistricting reform, an issue the House Republican caucus is prioritizing this session and has supported for years. It will “stop” the culture that enabled unscrupulous behavior by some lawmakers over the past year and “devastated the state,” Minority Leader Jim Durkin, from Western Springs, said..  Villa Park Democratic Sen. Tom Cullerton was formally accused by a federal grand jury of collecting a salary as well as health and pension benefits from a labor union for work he did not do. He has pleaded not guilty..  Federal officials charged former Rep. Luis Arroyo, a Chicago Democrat, with bribery, charges that led him to relinquish his post..  And former Sen. Martin Sandoval, a Democrat from Chicago, pleaded guilty to federal bribery and tax evasion charges in a federal court in Chicago on Tuesday. He resigned effective Jan. 1..  Changing the method by which political maps are drawn “is probably the most important way we can clean up corruption and the culture that has created this horrible situation in Illinois,” Durkin said..  All 44 House GOP members support a constitutional amendment that would remove politicians from deciding the boundaries of districts in favor of an 11-member commission tasked with drawing maps in a “fair, above-board way,” Demmer said. It would affect boundaries of districts drawn after the 2020 census..  “The proposal for fair maps has been out there for years, and it’s one of the most thoroughly-discussed issues we’ve seen,” he said..  House Republicans are also pushing for legislation reforming lawmaker behavior. Rep. Grant Wehlri, from Naperville, said those “common sense measures” include prohibiting representatives and senators from being lobbyists while in office, preventing them from immediately becoming lobbyists after leaving their post and increasing the economic interest information legislators have to disclose..  “If the Democrats finally wanted to get serious on holding themselves accountable, and do what’s right for the people of Illinois, let’s move these pieces of legislation,” he said..  Durkin appeared to put the success of those changes, and others, on Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker..  “I think as leader of the party, he can get his members in line. That includes the [House] speaker [Chicago Democrat Michael Madigan] and also the president of the Senate [Oak Park Democrat Don Harmon]...,” he said..  His caucus is also planning to combat the “skyrocketing cost of property taxes” in Illinois, Rep. Dan Brady, R-Bloomington, said.

11,"Illinois Is Not Losing Its Highly Taxed Residents The state’s population is shrinking — but it’s also getting wealthier.

Illinois lost more residents than any other state in the 2010s. The reason, according to the Illinois Policy Institute , Wall Street Journal , and Chicago Tribune editorial board, is that it’s taxing them away..  “It’s not the weather pushing people out of this state … to other Midwestern states,” the Tribune wrote last month . “It is loss of opportunity, high taxes and frustration at fiscal mismanagement by government leaders that penalizes taxpayers..  “What does Indiana offer that Illinois doesn’t? Lower taxes, more stable home values, balanced state budgets and funded pension systems. Not better weather.”.  In fact, Illinois’s shrinking population is more complicated..  According to World Population Review , Illinois ranks ninth in overall tax burden, at 9.67 percent of a resident’s income. That’s mainly due to high property taxes; we rank 32nd in income tax and 13th in sales tax..  Plenty of states that gained population in the last 10 years have more onerous tax burdens than Illinois, including Hawaii and Minnesota. It’s true that of the four states that lost population in the last decade, three are among the top 10 most-taxed: Illinois, Vermont, and Connecticut. But the state that lost the largest percentage of its residents is West Virginia, which ranks only 15th..  Meanwhile, the state with the lowest tax burden, Alaska, is the 48th most populous. It lost more of its residents in the past year than any state besides West Virginia..  “The kneejerk tax thing doesn’t work because you can find high-tax areas that are growing in the U.S. and you can find low-tax areas that are declining,” demographer Rob Paral told the Better Government Association. “I know that gets lost on people who want to blame taxes on everything.”.  The tax argument gets sketchier when you look at who’s leaving Illinois. In a recent Bloomberg column titled “Goodbye, New York, California, and Hello… Where?,” Justin Fox observed that all three states were losing low-income residents faster than rich people, concluding “[i]t’s not all to Texas and it’s not all about taxes”:.  Domestic migration statistics are frequently cited as evidence of the failures of blue-state governance, in particular the higher taxes imposed by states that are losing lots of residents. There’s something to that — income-tax-free Florida sure is attracting a lot of affluent people from Illinois and New York, and a recent study of high-income California taxpayers concluded that a 2012 income tax increase there did in fact drive some away. But California, Illinois and New York have all experienced bigger per capita personal income gains than the nation as a whole since the beginning of 2010, and all saw taxpayers with incomes below $50,000 overrepresented among the leavers from 2011 through 2018. These departures may indicate failures of governance as well, but it’s a different set of governance failures, presumably related more to housing costs, commutes and job opportunities than taxes per se..  Demographer Alden Loury agrees, telling this magazine last year that “[Chicago] is losing more of its lower-income folks and gaining more higher-income workers.” That trend is the consequence of a “demographic inversion,” in which a once–working class city attracts wealthy residents, while low-earning residents are forced into outlying neighborhoods and suburbs — or, on a larger scale, other states..  In fact, Illinois’s most notable demographic shift is not the loss of wealthy, highly taxed residents, but of its black middle class , which has been shrinking for decades due to neighborhood disinvestment, rising property values, and lack of economic opportunity..  A comparison of 2010 Census data with the 2013–2017 American Community Survey shows that Illinois’s white, Latino, and Asian populations all increased, while its black population declined from 1,866,414 to 1,833,501. According to the same data, Illinois saw a decline in households earning less than $100,000 a year, while those earning more than $200,000 increased by 50 percent. The state’s real per capita income is also on an upward trend , from $43,208 in 2010 to $53,727 in 2019..  Meanwhile, September data analysis by the Tribune found two things: that many black Illinoisans departed for nearby Indiana, and that Chicago alone is driving much of the state’s population loss (though the metro area continues to draw black residents away from the city)..  It’s possible that high taxes were a burden on those residents who fled Illinois, but it’s not clear that lowering the tax rate would solve the problem, either. In fact, the structural issues facing low-income residents are ones that would most benefit from a government cash infusion.

14,"CoStar Group.  The Jewel-Osco store in Woodlawn..  Less than a year after opening, the Jewel-Osco in Woodlawn has a new owner: the University of Chicago..  A venture connected to the university paid $19.8 million in November for the 48,000-square-foot grocery-and-drug store at 61st Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, according to a deed filed with Cook County. The venture acquired the store from the developers that built it, Chicago-based DL3 Realty and Wilmette-based Terraco Real Estate..  The store, which is leased to Jewel-Osco parent Albertsons, became a symbol of Woodlawn’s comeback when it opened last March, bringing fresh produce and other healthy food options to a South Side “food desert,” providing jobs for more than 200 people and generating momentum for a broader community-development push in the neighborhood..  The sale also validates the idea that Woodlawn offers attractive returns for investors that put their capital into commercial properties there, said DL3 Managing Partner Leon Walker..  “As this investment helps the market stabilize, it encourages other (businesses) to see Woodlawn as a place of opportunity,” he said..  Yet the deal still needed a subsidy to work out. DL3 and Terraco financed the Jewel-Osco project, which cost more than $20 million, with $11.5 million in New Markets Tax Credits acquired by Northern Trust..  Walker declined to get into financial specifics but said the project generated a good return for its investors even though the $19.8 million sale price fell short of its total cost..  The University of Chicago considered the Jewel-Osco “an important community asset and decided to purchase the property to ensure that it remains locally controlled rather than going to a national buyer,” university spokesman Jeremy Manier wrote in an email..  “The University is committed to making sure the store remains a valuable resource for the community, similar to other commercial properties that the university owns in the area,” he wrote..  The university financed its acquisition with a $14.8 million loan from Beverly Bank & Trust, according to a mortgage filed with the county..  Brokerage Greenstone Partners arranged the sale. Greg Dietz, managing partner in Greenstone’s Chicago office, said a confidentiality agreement prevented him from discussing the transaction..  Just south of thriving Hyde Park, Woodlawn has started to attract investment after decades of population loss and decay. One big project has received the lion’s share of the attention: the proposed Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park, on the east end of the neighborhood..  But plenty of dollars are flowing in from other sources. Preservation of Affordable Housing, a Boston nonprofit, has invested heavily in Woodlawn, with properties including Woodlawn Station, a 70-unit apartment project at Cottage Grove and 63rd Street that opened in 2018..  DL3 may be best known in Chicago for developing Englewood Square, a shopping center in Englewood anchored by a Whole Foods Market. But the firm has been busy in Woodlawn. DL3 is working on a 72,000-square-foot office-and-retail project on the site of the current Washington Park National Bank Building, also at Cottage Grove and 63rd. At another corner on the intersection, DL3 plans a 42,000-square-foot building that will include medical office space and a fitness center..  The increased investment has fueled concerns about potential gentrification, as rising apartment rents push people out. Parts of the neighborhood east of Cottage Grove are vulnerable to displacement because of significantly rising prices, according to the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University.

15,"Fifth Third Bank, National Association, announced today that Chicago-based Decennial Group will serve as a partner to help it invest $30 million in Qualified Opportunity Zones as part of its $100 million commitment announced last Friday. The funds will be used to develop projects in low-income urban and rural communities within the Bank’s footprint. The $100 million investment by Fifth Third Bank represents one of the largest made by an institution with a social impact investment strategy in Opportunity Zones..  “We are thrilled to partner with Decennial to work on Qualified Opportunity Zones in Chicago and throughout Illinois and the Midwest,” said Mitchell Feiger, regional chairman and CEO of Fifth Third Bank, Chicago. “With this agreement in place, Decennial Group is working to immediately identify qualified development opportunities in Chicago and other Midwest markets. The group’s goal is to deploy Fifth Third’s capital and accelerate market activity in order to create high-quality, affordable housing. Fifth Third expects to make a substantial commitment to Illinois with this program.”.  Decennial Group is a vertically integrated investment management and development platform that will manage the assets for a minimum of 10 years, consistent with the requirements of investments made in Qualified Opportunity Zone locations..  “Decennial Group was created to lead pioneering investments in underserved communities,” said Bob Clark, Decennial Managing Partner and Clayco CEO. “This partnership with Fifth Third will allow us to make a significant impact in Qualified Opportunity Zones in Chicago, the state of Illinois, and throughout the Midwest. We intend to bring the full impact of Decennial’s financial, operational, and industry expertise to create projects that help transform underinvested neighborhoods into affordable, vibrant, and thriving communities.”.

This will further our common goal of ensuring that INVEST South/West community corridors receive strategic investments, enhancing the quality of life and economic growth to benefit all our neighbors.”.  Designed to spur long-term private sector investment into economic development and job creation in economically distressed communities, Opportunity Zones were established as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to promote investment and development in a significant number of qualified low-income census tracts.

16,"Getty Images.  Home price growth stalled last fall in the Chicago area..  The region’s single-family home values grew by 0.4 percent in November from a year earlier, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices released this morning. It was the third straight month of growth so slender it’s essentially flat: October’s figure was 0.5 percent; September’s was 0.6 percent..  In the index’s Chicago data going back to February 1988, there is no other span of three months when home prices grew by less than 1 percent, except when they were negative in years after the housing bust of the mid-2000s..  In the November report, Chicago’s home price growth was the weakest among the 20 major U.S. cities that the index tracks. In some months of 2019, both San Francisco and Seattle went negative as their overheated housing markets cooled off, but in November both were positive, with San Francisco’s prices up 0.5 percent and Seattle’s up 3.3 percent. Related Here's how home prices did last year where you live.  Nationwide, according to the index, home values were up 3.5 percent, or nearly nine times the Chicago figure. For much of 2018 and 2019, Chicago home price growth was running at about half the national rate: first in the 3 percent range when the nation was at 6, and in the cool-down that began in February 2019, Chicago was at around 1.5 percent when the nation was at 3..  The gap is wide between Chicago’s housing market and the nation’s. At the November index level, local values were about 13 percent below their September 2006 peak. Nationwide, home prices were about 15 percent above their old peak..  There’s a familiar litany of reasons for Chicago’s slowdown: population loss that slows demand for homes, decreasing the need to bid prices up; high property taxes and the uncertainty about how much more they’ll go up, which causes some homebuyers to curtail the price they pay in order to keep the total cost of homeownership from growing fast, and the lack of an economic boom like the tech business that has boosted home values in places like San Francisco and Seattle..  Note that the index lags behind market reports by Illinois Realtors, which last week released data showing a big increase in home prices in December. It’s likely Case-Shiller’s report that comes out in late February will show a similar change, although it may not be quite as steep an increase, as the two reports use different methodologies. The trade association reports the prices of all homes sold in a month, while the index compares individual homes to their past sale prices..  “Chicago is still seeing home prices rise, albeit at a softer pace compared to the nation’s largest markets,"" Bill Banfield, Quicken Loans chief risk officer, said in an email to Crain's after the data was released this morning. ""Directionally speaking, prices have been climbing for eight years, meaning buyers can capitalize on prices remaining under control now that interest rates are falling again.” Letter to the Editor.

25,"Chicago Tribune | Feb 26, 2020 | 6:57 PM Militza M. Pagan, an attorney with the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, speaks during a news conference after oral arguments in front of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago on Feb. 26, 2020. Cook County and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights filed a lawsuit last year challenging the government's ""public charge"" rule. (Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) President Donald Trump’s “public charge” rule — which could penalize immigrants who seek public benefits — faced a bombardment of critical questions Wednesday from federal appeals judges hearing Cook County’s legal challenge to the change..  Just days after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the rule change to go into effect, three judges on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, including one who participated by video, grilled Gerard Sinzdak, the attorney representing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, on the definition of public charge. U.S. Appellate Chief Judge Diane Wood pressed for evidence to support changes in the rule, saying some of it seemed to be plucked ""out of thin air” and not from data on immigrants. Advertisement.  Federal immigration authorities started implementing the rule Monday after the Supreme Court reversed an injunction issued in Cook County’s legal challenge, though Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a sharp dissent. But the legal challenges continue, and Wednesday’s arguments will determine if the appellate court will rule against the change..  “Public charge"" refers to immigrants who are primarily dependent on some form of public assistance, which advocates of the rule-tightening say puts an undue and unfair burden on limited tax resources. The new rule broadens that definition, meaning the agency could deny the application of someone who entered the country legally and is seeking permanent residency. It also applies to those seeking to apply or extend a visa..  Under the rule, people could have their applications rejected if they used or are likely to use programs such as Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, some forms of Medicaid and certain housing programs. [Most read] 5 killed, gunman dead in mass shooting at Molson Coors campus in Milwaukee, officials confirm ».  Officials also weigh other factors when reviewing visa or green card applications, such as a person’s age, health, family status, overall assets, employment and their ability to speak English. Certain immigrants will be exempt from the rule, such as refugees, asylees and certain crime victims..  Immigrants would not be penalized for using programs including disaster relief, national school lunch, Head Start, and subsidized student and mortgage loans..  On Wednesday, the judges posed several scenarios, trying to gauge how soon the government would deem an immigrant a public charge. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a person would be a public charge if they received benefits for more than 12 months in a 36-month period..  But under questioning from the judges, Sinzdak said it was possible for someone to be deemed a public charge if they received multiple benefits in less than 12 months. He pointed out that Homeland Security narrowed down the benefits to food, housing and medical care..  “Only the most important things a person needs,” Wood said in response..  Wood also brought up the threat of the coronavirus, questioning if the rule might stop an immigrant from seeking medical attention out of fear, thus costing the government more money if the virus spreads. “If the government wants to create a pandemic, go ahead,” Wood said. “It seems very foolish.”.  Sinzdak responded that immigrants could seek private care and pay for it themselves..  Another question raised was why the government didn’t instead seek reimbursement from people sponsoring immigrants who used public benefits. Sinzdak said that while the government can seek that form of reimbursement, it is costly and time consuming..  David Morrison, an attorney representing Cook County, said the county could end up with higher medical costs and lower federal reimbursements if fewer immigrant patients apply for Medicaid out of fear. [Most read] His brother stumbled back into Richard’s Bar after being stabbed. He had to decide: ‘Do I hold my brother for his last dying breaths … or go find the guy who did this?’ ».  He also argued the rule has a chilling effect similar to when Trump’s administration sought to place a citizenship question on the 2020 census. Morrison said the rule will cause people to choose between health care and their immigration status. Advertisement.  The court of appeals is expected to issue a ruling within a few weeks. Militza Pagán, an attorney with the Shriver Center on Poverty Law who is working with Cook County and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights on the legal challenge, said if the court rules in favor of their original injunction, they expect the government could seek review from the U.S. Supreme Court..  “We think that the rule is discriminatory and it’s unjust and a cruel public charge rule,"" Pagán said..  The rule was initially supposed to go into effect Oct. 15, but it was entangled in challenges, including Cook County’s. In January, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a ruling out of New York that placed a nationwide hold on the rule. For the time, the government could not implement the rule in Illinois. Then last week, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the injunction in Illinois. Daywatch Newsletter","[0.5002018809318542, 0.499798059463501]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5002018809318542

28,"Humanity's expansion, consumption and transformation of land and sea have caused wildlife populations to plunge over five decades, signaling a ""broken"" relationship with nature that helped trigger the global coronavirus pandemic, a report says..  Average populations of nearly 4,400 mammals, amphibians, birds, fish and reptiles dropped by 68% since 1970, according to the World Wildlife Fund report, which is based on vertebrate monitoring projects around the world. The losses have been driven primarily by habitat loss, it says, along with pollution, invasive species, overhunting and overfishing, and increasingly, climate change..   The result is dysfunctional ecosystems -- bereft of important pollinators, predators and scavengers -- less able to support human or animal health, said Rebecca Shaw, the fund's chief scientist..  The ""Living Planet Report,"" published every two years, is the latest to describe stunning declines in biodiversity resulting from human activity. The United Nations warned last year that 1 million plant and animal species are on the verge of extinction. Also in 2019, ornithologists and government agencies reported North America had lost nearly 3 billion birds over 50 years..  But World Wildlife Fund officials emphasized one catastrophic consequence of the declines is now before our eyes. The coronavirus pandemic, caused by the sort of ""spillover"" of a zoonotic virus that is becoming more common as humans expand their footprint, should be viewed as ""an SOS signal for the human enterprise,"" the report says..  The report ""provides unequivocal evidence that nature is unraveling and that our planet is flashing red warning signs,"" wrote Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International. ""COVID-19 is a clear manifestation of our broken relationship with nature and highlights the deep interconnection between the health of both people and the planet."".  by signing up you agree to our terms of service More than two-thirds of emerging infectious diseases in humans have origins in animals, and scientists say the virus that causes COVID-19 probably originated in a horseshoe bat, though the virus's precise path to people remains unknown. What's clear is that animal viruses have more chances to hop to humans as we develop formerly wild spaces, fly around the globe, trade in wildlife and intensify livestock production..  ""If you start deforesting and are grabbing those animals out of the forest and putting them on trains and putting them on trucks and boats, alive, with domestic animals and humans, you have all this viral mixing,"" Shaw said. ""We're disrupting nature and creating the opportunity for these spillover events."".  Wildlife losses were particularly precipitous for freshwater species, which saw an average decline of 84%, in part because of the near disappearance of most wetlands that existed 500 years ago, the report said. The average drop in species monitored in Central and South America was an astonishing 94%, it said..  Populations of animals large and small are dwindling, and are changing differently in different regions, according to the report..  While tigers are on the rise in Nepal, the big cats' numbers have fallen by more than 20% in Russia's Far East, where habitat loss, a decline in prey and poaching pose threats. Agriculture has caused gray partridges in the United Kingdom to plummet, while illegal hunting and mining have driven down the Grauer's gorilla population in the Congo by 87%..   Several species of vibrantly speckled harlequin frogs in Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela have faced ""catastrophic"" losses and extinctions, mostly attributable to a fungal disease that may have originated in East Asia in the 20th century and then shot around the planet with the boom in global trade and the exotic pet market..  Despite the declines, Shaw said urgent changes could blunt or even reverse some of the damage. Modeling carried out by the World Wildlife Fund and 50 partners as part of a two-year-old initiative called ""Bending The Curve"" found recovery will require a combination of increasing land conservation efforts and, crucially, overhauling food production to make it more sustainable and efficient and less wasteful. Those findings were described Thursday in the journal Nature..  The ""Living Planet Report"" describes wildlife population declines not only because they act as a barometer for ecosystem health but also because they contain glimmers of hope, Shaw said..  ""If you only measure threatened and endangered species, which has really been the focus for the conservation community for many, many years,"" Shaw said, ""you're way too late."".  0 Comments Related Coverage Related Article.

29,"Editor’s note: This story originally ran May 29, 2019. Illinois residents making $1.5 million a year pay less in income taxes than their counterparts in all but eight of the 41 states with such a tax..  But for people making $60,000 a year, it's a different story. In 24 of the states, those taxpayers pay less than in Illinois..   The ratios would shift if voters approve a graduated income tax in November 2020. A graduated tax formula being discussed in Springfield is intended to increase taxes on the rich, reduce taxes on lower- and middle-income taxpayers, and generate billions in new revenue..  Supporters believe the proposed graduated income tax rates can be easily absorbed by those who will be hit hardest. The top tax rate, 7.99%, is reserved for single filers who claim more than $750,000 of income and couples claiming more than $1 million..  ""It's being done in a very rational way,"" said Ralph Martire, executive director of the bipartisan Center for Tax and Budget Accountability. ""That top rate kicks in at a much higher level than almost everywhere else in the country."".  In the state rankings, under the graduated tax proposal:.  • Illinois filers with incomes over $1.5 million would move from the ninth lowest income taxes among the 41 states to the 35th lowest, meaning their income taxes would become among the highest..  by signing up you agree to our terms of service • Those with incomes of $500,000 would move from 11th lowest to 26th lowest..  • Residents with incomes of $150,000 would move in the other direction, from 15th lowest to 13th lowest..  • And those with incomes of $60,000 would move from 24th lowest to 21st lowest..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotel chain, ran his campaign on the promise to change the state constitution to allow a graduated income tax. Both the Senate and House approved putting the constitutional amendment on the 2020 ballot, where it would need approval by more than 60% of the voters to pass..  Illinois is one of nine states with a flat income tax rate. Seven states have no income tax, while New Hampshire and Tennessee tax only certain investment income..  Opponents of the graduated tax argue that creating different rates for different levels of income is unfair and will push people to leave the state, which has seen a steady population decline over the past five years..   ""A flat tax percentage applied to any taxpayer already hits higher earners harder and produces more revenue from higher earners than lower earners,"" said Edward Tiesenga, a village trustee in Oak Brook, one of the few towns in Illinois where the average taxpayer will pay more under the graduated tax plan..  Under the graduated income tax plan that passed the House Revenue Committee, tax rates rise in steps, with the first $10,000 in income taxed at 4.75%, the next $90,000 taxed at 4.90%, and the next $150,000 taxed at 4.95% ­-- the current rate under the flat tax. Any income over $250,000 triggers a tax rate of 7.75%. The rate climbs to 7.85% for income over $350,000 for single filers and $500,000 for couples..  The biggest tax increase would come to single filers with income over $750,000 and married couples with incomes over $1 million. Their tax rate would be 7.99%, and unlike people in lower income brackets, they would pay that flat rate on all of their income..  If approved, only six states would have a higher effective income tax rate on a $1.5 million tax return than Illinois..  Supporters and Pritzker administration officials note that 97% of taxpayers will pay the same or less in income taxes under the graduated plan. And, they say, the rates will actually have a bearing on the middle class, unlike many other states with a graduated rate formula. That includes states like Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Virginia where the maximum rate is applied to income over $20,000 -- in some cases over $3,000..  ""Our plan is simpler and it is a true graduated tax,"" said Dan Hynes, Illinois's former comptroller and current deputy governor. ""And it's designed to be fair statewide."".  The additional revenue is intended to help pay down a backlog of bills as well close a gap in the state's operating budget..  Some don't believe the state is doing enough to reduce spending, including pension costs..  ""In the abstract, the graduated tax might seem more fair, but the motivation behind the graduated tax is to tax a minority for the benefit of the majority, and it may have unintended consequences,"" said Laurence Msall, president of the nonpartisan government research organization the Civic Federation. ""There needs to be a more significant structural change in expenditures and consolidation of government and services."".  0 Comments","[0.5029453635215759, 0.49705466628074646]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5029453635215759

As part of Governor JB Pritzker's historic $45 billion capital program, the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) announced on Jan. 27th a new initiative to invest $12 million to support investment in the state's opportunity zones..  Governor Pritzker announced this new program at an event to announce also a commitment by Fifth Third Bank and the Chicago-based Decennial Group to invest nearly $15 million in Ilinois' opportunity zones. Supporting equitable economic growth is one of the central goals of our historic $45 billion capital plan,\"" said Gov. JB Pritzker. \""By investing $12 million in Rebuild Illinois funds in Opportunity Zone projects, we can take advantage of this federal tax incentive to stretch our capital dollars further while creating jobs and opportunity in communities that have suffered from a lack of investment for decades..  DCEO will invite communities, nonprofits, developers, and other stakeholders to compete for $12 million in capital grants to support projects in Opportunity Zones..  Opportunity Zones are defined as distressed or economically underserved areas census tracts..

The Chicago Sun Times says the Retention of Illinois Students and Equity Act, which went into effect Jan. 1, offers state financial aid to illegal aliens -- ""undocumented students"" -- and transgenders.

34,"By Press release submission | Jan 28, 2020.  Illinois State Senate District 32 issued the following announcement on Jan. 24..  A major issue with the state’s Automatic Voter Registration program is raising questions about the integrity of Illinois' elections. Meanwhile, as the Illinois General Assembly gears up for the spring session, and the process of filing new legislation begins, Senate Republicans continue to push for fair political maps. Locally, I had the privilege of participating in an Eagle Scout ceremony recognizing the accomplishments of a special young man..  Non-citizens “accidentally” registered to vote.  According to media reports, more than 500 people who are not citizens and are not legally eligible to vote in elections, were registered to vote through the state’s Automatic Voter Registration (AVR) system, which was signed into law in 2017..  The AVR system automatically registers voters when they apply for a driver’s license or state ID card, unless the individual opts out of the process. Between July 2, 2018, and December 13, 2019, the registration information of 574 people was “improperly forwarded” to the Illinois State Board of Elections, according to a December 18, 2019 letter from the Illinois Secretary of State’s office to the elections board..  The 574 individuals had all checked a “no” box on a question asking if they were US citizens. According to the Secretary of State’s office, the issue was due to a “programming error” involved with the registration process. The Illinois State Board of Elections notified the local election authorities where the individuals reside, and has sent letters to the individuals themselves. Of the improperly registered voters, 126 live in Chicago, 135 in other parts of Cook County, 56 in DuPage County, 54 in Lake County, 1 in Christian County, and 1 in Sangamon County..  All 19 Republican members of the Illinois Senate sent a letter to the Secretary of State’s office seeking further information about the issue. The request included information on which locations erroneously registered voters, what investigatory steps would be taken and what would be done to prevent situations like this in the future..  “It is imperative the residents of Illinois know their elections are being managed and conducted in a lawful manner, and ensuring our laws are being implemented correctly is a practical matter, not a partisan one,” the letter stated..  Since being signed into law in August of 2017, the Illinois AVR system registered more than 600,000 individuals to vote.

As a new legislative session begins, Senate Republicans are again calling on the chamber to take action fixing the current partisan practice of drawing gerrymandered or politically-manipulated maps..  Every ten years, the state is required to redraw legislative and Congressional districts to match the results of the most recent census. Illinois currently has a “winner take all” system where one party has the complete power to draw the maps, which typically leads to confusing and strangely shaped or “gerrymandered” districts..  They note that the maps are typically drawn not to represent the people of Illinois and their communities best, but to offer the party in power the best chance at electoral success. The process is often criticized for allowing politicians to pick their districts, instead of the people choosing their representatives..  Unfortunately, numerous attempts throughout the years to fix the politically-biased system were blocked by legislative leaders and lawsuits. Still, the Illinois General Assembly does have the power to put the question of whether to fix the current system on the ballot for voters to decide. The Senators noted the concept of fair maps has broad bipartisan support, and current Governor JB Pritzker expressed his support for the idea, along with former President Barack Obama making the issue a key component of his speech to the General Assembly in 2016..  Legislative process begins anew.  State Senators and Representatives are finalizing their legislative agendas and filing their proposals in legislative form. With the spring legislative session set to begin on January 28th, lawmakers need to file their bills soon so the ideas can be acted upon in the coming months..  The deadline for the introduction of substantive bills in the Senate, which deal with new laws and changes to existing laws, is on February 14th. Those bills then have until March 27th to be heard in committees, and until April 24th to be called for a vote in the chamber. After that, the Senate considers legislation that has passed the House and appropriations or spending bills, which will form the state’s budget. The session is scheduled to adjourn on May 31st..  Recognizing an Eagle Scout.  I had the pleasure recently to present a Senate Resolution to Conor Rada (pictured right) of Boy Scout Troop 679 for attaining the rank of Eagle Scout..  The Eagle Scout Award is Scouting’s highest rank. The award ceremony highlights the courage, determination and perseverance of our youth, and gives me great hope for the future leaders of our communities. It was also great to see some “older” Eagle Scouts in attendance showing support..  Only about 4 percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout rank each year, so it is a phenomenal achievement..

35,"Illinois House Republicans tie ethics reforms to redistricting changes REBECCA ANZEL {{featured_button_text}}.  House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, center, from Western Springs, says redistricting reform is necessary to fix the culture that has ""devastated the state."" He was joined at a Statehouse press conference Tuesday by Rep. Dan Brady, R-Bloomington, left, Rep. Grant Wehrli, R-Naperville, and Rep. Tom Demmer, R-Dixon. REBECCA ANZEL, CAPITOL NEWS ILLINOIS Save.  SPRINGFIELD — Remodeling how Illinois’ political districts are drawn is the key to addressing the “dark cloud” of ethical violations hovering over state government, House Republican leaders said Tuesday..  Communities are grouped “primarily for political advantage,” Dixon Republican Rep. Tom Demmer said, restricting residents’ ability to hold their legislators accountable..  “These political entrenchments — these situations in which politicians pick their voters instead of voters picking their politicians — had a chilling impact on our ability to debate the important issues of the day here in Springfield,” he added..  One of those is redistricting reform, an issue the House Republican caucus is prioritizing this session and has supported for years. It will “stop” the culture that enabled unscrupulous behavior by some lawmakers over the past year and “devastated the state,” Minority Leader Jim Durkin, from Western Springs, said..  Villa Park Democratic Sen. Tom Cullerton was formally accused by a federal grand jury of collecting a salary as well as health and pension benefits from a labor union for work he did not do.

Changing the method by which political maps are drawn “is probably the most important way we can clean up corruption and the culture that has created this horrible situation in Illinois,” Durkin said..  All 44 House GOP members support a constitutional amendment that would remove politicians from deciding the boundaries of districts in favor of an 11-member commission tasked with drawing maps in a “fair, above-board way,” Demmer said. It would affect boundaries of districts drawn after the 2020 census..  “The proposal for fair maps has been out there for years, and it’s one of the most thoroughly-discussed issues we’ve seen,” he said..  House Republicans are also pushing for legislation reforming lawmaker behavior. Rep. Grant Wehlri, from Naperville, said those “common sense measures” include prohibiting representatives and senators from being lobbyists while in office, preventing them from immediately becoming lobbyists after leaving their post and increasing the economic interest information legislators have to disclose..  “If the Democrats finally wanted to get serious on holding themselves accountable, and do what’s right for the people of Illinois, let’s move these pieces of legislation,” he said..  Durkin appeared to put the success of those changes, and others, on Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker..  “I think as leader of the party, he can get his members in line. That includes the [House] speaker [Chicago Democrat Michael Madigan] and also the president of the Senate [Oak Park Democrat Don Harmon]...,” he said..  His caucus is also planning to combat the “skyrocketing cost of property taxes” in Illinois, Rep. Dan Brady, R-Bloomington, said.

The opening of additional test sites on Friday, June 26 add to the 57 locations previously opened in Illinois . More The opening of these new sites reflects the company's commitment to meeting ongoing demand for testing, as well as expanding testing capacity to respond to a surge in new COVID-19 cases. The nearly 200 additional test sites opening across the country this week are among the more than 1,400 locations CVS Health has opened since May and expand the company's testing capacity to more than 1.5 million tests per month, subject to availability of supplies and lab capacity. In addition to the drive-thru sites, CVS Health has partnered with a number of community organizations to open eight rapid-response community testing sites across the country, which aim to increase access to testing for uninsured and underserved populations who are at highest risk for COVID-19. ""One of our greatest strengths as a company is our local presence in communities across the country, which enables us to uniquely expand people's access to safe and effective COVID-19 testing options and respond to a need for increased testing capacity,"" said Larry J.

39,"Teilen Drucken NEW YORK , June 25, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- The NHP Foundation (NHPF) is pleased to announce that its affordable SRO property in Chicago , The Mark Twain, has achieved Enterprise Green Communities certification, the country's only national green building certification program designed explicitly for the affordable housing sector featuring a comprehensive set of guidelines to encourage green building practices. ""Attaining our first Green Communities certification for our first SRO rehab in Chicago is a point of pride for NHPF as we work to design and build sustainably in the area,"" said Mecky Adnani , Sr. VP, NHPF and the lead developer on The Mark Twain undertaking. The work within the SRO included all new mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems including a new extremely energy-efficient variable refrigerant flow mechanical system for central heat and air conditioning for all units. In addition to succeeding with all mandatory program criteria, the project achieved the points required for certification by: Being a compact development (with three times the density of the census block in which the project is located) Developing in proximity to critical resources for healthy living and access to opportunity including access to public transportation (with a Chicago Transit Authority Red Line Station which provides 24-hour a day public transportation at the corner; access to three different bus lines within 175 feet; and bike lanes on the street where the project is located) Increasing accessibility to fresh local food, 0.1 miles from the Division St. Farmer's Market Offering Universal Design, with 20% of the units designed to meet ICC/ANSI A117.1 Type A requirements Reducing energy usage with Home Energy Rating System (HERS) Index Scores lower more efficient than required by the program. According to The Mark Twain architect, Rich Klein , Weese Langley Weese Architects LTD, ""It's a privilege to have a client dedicated to bringing this level of sustainability to the preservation of this historic building. The building is 29% more efficient than it is required to be by the energy code and we achieved a 29% indoor water use reduction."" The Enterprise Green Communities Criteria was created in 2010 to yield lowered utility costs, a healthier living environment and increased sustainability while benefiting the financial stability of both residents and affordable housing owners. Chicago has seen 16 Green Communities certified buildings since the program's inception. ""Maintaining affordability through preservation of SRO housing, as NHPF is doing with the Mark Twain, is so important for the city. And by rehabbing the Mark Twain to the Green Communities Criteria, NHPF has ensured that they've created a smarter, more energy-efficient building that will provide stable, healthy and sustainable homes for years to come,"" said Krista Egger , National Initiatives Vice President, Enterprise Community Partners.

41,"Chicago Tribune | Jun 25, 2020 at 6:36 PM Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson listens to the mayor make an announcement to provide free high-speed internet to more than 100,000 Chicago students and their families, during a press event at Evergreen Academy Middle School on June 25, 2020. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) When the internet signal from a relative’s apartment downstairs fails to reach Yolanda Williams, it can disrupt the school day for her 13-year-old daughter, a student at William Penn Elementary in North Lawndale. In those moments, Williams will say it’s time to take a break, and the pair might go outside or bake brownies. Advertisement She’s hopeful they’ll be beneficiaries of an ambitious plan announced Thursday by Mayor Lori Lightfoot to provide free high-speed internet to more than 100,000 Chicago students and their families. District officials cited census data showing that’s close to the number of students who lack high-speed internet access. Billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin and the Obamas are among the initiative’s financial backers. Advertisement “I think that it’s wonderful it can help some people who are not in the position that I am in, to be able to use my uncle, a relative’s hotspot,” said Williams, whose daughter is what’s known in CPS as a diverse learner. “Some people don’t even have that option.” The effort is expected to take four years and cost $50 million, with the largest chunk of startup money, $7.5 million, coming from Griffin, and millions more provided by other local philanthropists and federal CARES Act stimulus money. “This first-of-its-kind program will be one of the largest and longest-term efforts in the nation to provide free, high-speed internet over the course of four years to dramatically increase internet accessibility for students and help build a permanent public support system for families in Chicago,” according to a city statement. The abrupt shift to remote learning amid the coronavirus pandemic this spring laid bare a gaping digital equity issue in Chicago Public Schools, where roughly a third of students were found to lack reliable computer access for digital schoolwork. Since then, the district has provided tens of thousands of laptops and tablets for families in need. “This is essential whether we are in a remote learning environment or not,” CPS CEO Janice Jackson said during Thursday’s announcement with Lightfoot at Evergreen Middle School. She added that having high-speed internet and computer access is now “as essential as we thought having textbooks were in the 1980s.” Graduates and students of Evergreen Academy Middle School attended an announcement of a plan to provide free high-speed internet to more than 100,000 Chicago students and their families. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Lightfoot said families in need on the West and South sides will be the top priority for the new program, which will also weigh in factors such as household income, homelessness and students who have special education needs. Internet access is “more than just an accessory,” she said. “It is one of the most powerful equalizers we have.” She cited a national Pew study that found more than 20% of students couldn’t complete schoolwork because they lacked internet access, rising to 40% among low-income households. “Unfortunately, the realities of that study are very much borne out here in Chicago,” Lightfoot said. The pandemic revealed “unacceptable disparities across the city,” inequities that have existed for generations, she said. Even though some internet service providers have been offering free or reduced plans for low-income families, Chicagoans have reported a variety of roadblocks to actually getting that service. Williams, who lives with her daughter and mother in the upstairs apartment of an Austin two-flat, above her aunt and uncle, said she was turned away from one such plan. Even though she checked all the other boxes, she said she was denied because her uncle’s account was registered to the same address, unlike similar buildings where each apartment has its own. McKinley Park mom Lilia Guevara said she has one of the $9.99-a-month programs, but it’s often slow and at times impossible for all three of her children to connect for remote learning. Advertisement Guevara said she had been working temp jobs and volunteering, but had to stop when the pandemic hit and can’t work full-time because she needs to be constantly supporting her seventh-grade twins, who attend Evergreen and are also considered diverse learners. “If there is a program that is going to be free, that would be amazing, with better, higher quality,” she said. “... I’m not the only family who can benefit from this. I know there’s a lot of families in this neighborhood and the neighborhoods around us, the level of poverty ... they really need it.” Griffin, founder of the hedge fund Citadel and often cited as Illinois’ richest person, called internet connectivity “a lifeline to education and opportunity — extending learning beyond the classroom and opening pathways for development and wellbeing.” Breaking News Newsletter As it happens Get updates on the coronavirus pandemic and other news as it happens with our breaking email alerts You are now following this newsletter.

SPRINGFIELD, ILL. – In the last week, the Illinois Department of Agriculture (IDOA) announced $5 million in business recovery funding, which will go to livestock producers and small meat and poultry plant operations that continue to struggle during the COVID-19 pandemic..  The state government issued these funds from its Business Interruptions Grants (BIG). The money will also come from the CARES Act..  “Since the beginning of the pandemic, our Department has worked closely with the agriculture industry to understand and respond to the challenges they currently face,” said Jerry Costello II, acting director of IDOA. “I’m proud of the way Illinois’ farmers, small businesses and commodity groups came together to keep the food chain secure. These dollars enable farmers’ continuity of operations while providing our small meat and poultry plants the ability to make necessary improvements to expand animal throughput and capacity.”.  Illinois set up three programs for business to access these funds including: The swine depopulation program, which covers the costs and expenses of swine producers associated with the depopulation and disposal of livestock due to the disruption of the livestock market caused by COVID-19 on or after April 15, 2020. Applicants can receive up to $10,000 for losses. The agriculture business interruption program covers monetary losses and expenses of livestock producers due to the disruption of the livestock market caused by COVID-19 during the period of April 15 to May 15, 2020. Expenses that can be used for the program include holding livestock and other livestock-related products during an extended time period. Applicants can receive up to $10,000 for losses. The meat and poultry capacity program can cover costs for operations associated with facility improvements that are necessary to decrease or eliminate COVID-19 related slowdowns. Businesses must have no more than 60 employees. Applicants are eligible to receive up to $25,000 for eligible expenses..  IDOA announced that an additional 10% will be awarded to businesses located in disproportionately impacted areas (DIAs). Those areas are defined by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker’s administration and the Illinois General Assembly.

49,"Gov. J.B. Pritzker responds to questions during news conference in Chicago, Aug. 10..  Photo: Anthony Vazquez/Associated Press.  Illinois is the nation’s leading fiscal basket case, with runaway pension liabilities and public-union control of Springfield. But it has had one saving grace: a flat-rate income tax that makes it harder for the political class to raise taxes. Now that last barrier to decline is in jeopardy on the November ballot..  The peril comes in a ballot measure backed by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker and his party’s supermajority in the Legislature. A yes vote would amend the state constitution to replace the current 4.95% flat levy with a progressive rate structure on individual income. Gov. Pritzker, an heir to the.  Hyatt.  hotel fortune, is pitching this “Fair Tax” as a modest plea for more revenue from “wealthy people like me.” Hardly..  Democrats have announced a slate of new rates that will be imposed automatically if the measure passes. The current flat rate of 4.95% would rise to 7.75% for households earning above $250,000, with a top rate of 7.99% on incomes above $1 million. Proponents are also touting a planned tax cut for those making less than $250,000. But with a new bottom rate only 0.2 percentage point below the current one, taxpayers in that range can expect savings barely enough for an order of deep-dish pizza..  Mr. Pritzker says the economic slowdown requires raising more state revenue. But as the Prairie State’s own Barack Obama put it in 2011, “You don’t raise taxes in a recession.” Illinois’s unemployment rate in August was 10.9%, more than two points above the national average. The new tax scheme would further slow the jobs recovery by lifting the corporate tax rate to 7.99%, and by increasing the pass-through taxes paid by more than 100,000 small-business owners, according to the Illinois Policy Institute..  The tax increases won’t stop there. The political virtue of a flat tax is that it requires raising taxes on anyone who earns income. With a progressive structure, politicians can claim they’re only raising taxes on “the rich.” The state soon becomes beholden to affluent taxpayers for 40% to 50% of state tax revenue, even as the affluent increasingly leave the state..  Here the pattern of other blue states is instructive. Democratic governors have often lowballed voters with modest rates when introducing a new tax, only to ratchet up the levels in each administration. Take New Jersey, where Gov. Phil Murphy struck a deal recently to impose a 10.75% levy on earnings above $1 million. The move was only the latest of decades of increases that voters have been helpless to stop..  New Jersey first taxed individual income in 1976 amid a national revenue slump, with a top rate of 2.5%. Low rates held for 15 years before Democratic Gov. James Florio raised the tax to 7% on the wealthy and middle class. Voters revolted and swept underdog challenger Christine Todd Whitman into office in 1994. Yet facing a hostile statehouse, she secured a mere 0.63-point cut. A decade later Democrats raised the top rate to 8.97%, and last year Gov. Murphy added the 10.75% rate, which he expanded last month to reach more taxpayers..  Or take Connecticut, please. For decades its lack of an income tax lured New York workers and businesses, but Gov. Lowell Weicker introduced the tax in 1991, promising it would fix the state fisc. It didn’t, and the original 1.5% rate has since been raised five times to today’s 6.99%. The progressive tax ratchet is always up..  For evidence of the slippery slope ahead, Illinois voters can look at the trend in public debt. This month.  Moody’s.  warned that the state’s annual liabilities will exceed 45% of gross domestic product by 2021—the deepest fiscal hole in all 50 states. A progressive income tax would free lawmakers to shovel more money down that hole rather than address excessive government pensions..  Each year when revenues fall short of their target, or spending soars from public-union demands, expect Democrats to announce that still more taxpayers aren’t paying their “fair share.” Mr. Pritzker admitted as much only 100 days into his term when he said his plan includes “no guarantees” against raising taxes on the middle class..  If the progressive income tax passes, more residents will likely resort to the alternative of moving out. Illinois led the nation in out-migration over the past decade, with its population declining in each of the past six years, according to the Census Bureau. A 2019 survey by NPR Illinois and the University of Illinois found that high taxes were the top reason respondents gave for leaving..  The flat tax is the last structural political obstacle to the continued plundering of Illinois taxpayers by the Democratic-union ruling class. It’s also the only remaining discipline that might force lawmakers to reform runaway pensions. If taxpayers give Mr. Pritzker and the entrenched Legislature their way, they will accelerate the decline of a once great state.

But as the Prairie State’s own Barack Obama put it in 2011, “You don’t raise taxes in a recession.” Illinois’s unemployment rate in August was 10.9%, more than two points above the national average. The new tax scheme would further slow the jobs recovery by lifting the corporate tax rate to 7.99%, and by increasing the pass-through taxes paid by more than 100,000 small-business owners, according to the Illinois Policy Institute..  The tax increases won’t stop there. The political virtue of a flat tax is that it requires raising taxes on anyone who earns income. With a progressive structure, politicians can claim they’re only raising taxes on “the rich.” The state soon becomes beholden to affluent taxpayers for 40% to 50% of state tax revenue, even as the affluent increasingly leave the state..  Here the pattern of other blue states is instructive. Democratic governors have often lowballed voters with modest rates when introducing a new tax, only to ratchet up the levels in each administration. Take New Jersey, where Gov. Phil Murphy struck a deal recently to impose a 10.75% levy on earnings above $1 million. The move was only the latest of decades of increases that voters have been helpless to stop..  New Jersey first taxed individual income in 1976 amid a national revenue slump, with a top rate of 2.5%. Low rates held for 15 years before Democratic Gov. James Florio raised the tax to 7% on the wealthy and middle class. Voters revolted and swept underdog challenger Christine Todd Whitman into office in 1994. Yet facing a hostile statehouse, she secured a mere 0.63-point cut. A decade later Democrats raised the top rate to 8.97%, and last year Gov. Murphy added the 10.75% rate, which he expanded last month to reach more taxpayers..  Or take Connecticut, please. For decades its lack of an income tax lured New York workers and businesses, but Gov. Lowell Weicker introduced the tax in 1991, promising it would fix the state fisc. It didn’t, and the original 1.5% rate has since been raised five times to today’s 6.99%. The progressive tax ratchet is always up..  For evidence of the slippery slope ahead, Illinois voters can look at the trend in public debt. This month.  Moody’s.  warned that the state’s annual liabilities will exceed 45% of gross domestic product by 2021—the deepest fiscal hole in all 50 states. A progressive income tax would free lawmakers to shovel more money down that hole rather than address excessive government pensions..  Each year when revenues fall short of their target, or spending soars from public-union demands, expect Democrats to announce that still more taxpayers aren’t paying their “fair share.” Mr. Pritzker admitted as much only 100 days into his term when he said his plan includes “no guarantees” against raising taxes on the middle class..  If the progressive income tax passes, more residents will likely resort to the alternative of moving out. Illinois led the nation in out-migration over the past decade, with its population declining in each of the past six years, according to the Census Bureau. A 2019 survey by NPR Illinois and the University of Illinois found that high taxes were the top reason respondents gave for leaving..  The flat tax is the last structural political obstacle to the continued plundering of Illinois taxpayers by the Democratic-union ruling class. It’s also the only remaining discipline that might force lawmakers to reform runaway pensions. If taxpayers give Mr. Pritzker and the entrenched Legislature their way, they will accelerate the decline of a once great state.

57,"By Adam Schuster, Illinois Policy Institute | Feb 26, 2020.  The goal of public education should be to ensure that every student has the opportunity to maximize his or her full potential. Unfortunately, the Prairie State currently falls short of this goal because of a top-heavy education bureaucracy diverting resources that should rightly be going to classrooms for teachers and students..  Illinois is the only state that spent more than $1 billion on district-level administrative costs in 2017, the most recent year of data available from the U.S. Census Bureau. California has three times as many students, but spent nearly 40% less than Illinois on district administration. This spending only represents costs of the superintendent and school board. It does not include administrative spending within schools, such as on guidance counselors or principals..  Illinois spends $581 per student on district-level administration, more than double the national average of $230.62. If Illinois reduced its general administrative spending to the national average per student, it would save $708 million in unnecessary costs that could be reinvested in classrooms to improve student outcomes or returned to overburdened property taxpayers..  The reason for this overspending is simple: Illinois has too many school districts serving too few students. Four other states have student populations above 2 million, and each of them serves significantly more students for each administrative body overseeing its schools..  Illinois must consolidate school districts to reduce unnecessary administrative spending. Each district comes with highly paid superintendents, support staff and costly facilities. If districts serve more schools and more students, they can achieve economies of scale and greater efficiency without losing services..  State Rep. Rita Mayfield’s House Bill 4005 would put in motion a plan to rightsize the number of districts to ensure education dollars flow to classrooms instead of propping up administrative bloat.

65,"For the first time since the pandemic started, the University of Illinois Flash index is creeping up. As he contemplates whether Illinois has already hit bottom, U of I economics professor Fred Giertz says the rebound is going better for some than for others. “Some people have lost their jobs, but their income has pretty much been maintained” by federal programs, and the same — hit or miss — is true for businesses.

66,"Community Corner UFO Awareness Day: Sightings In Illinois, What They Saw Thursday, July 2, is UFO Awareness Day. People all over Illinois have reported seeing things in the sky they just can't explain. Jul 2, 2020 10:25 am CT | UpdatedJul 2, 2020 10:39 am CT Reply Illinois has more than 200 reported UFO sightings so far in 2020. (Photo via Shutterstock).  ILLINOIS — An unidentified flying object thought to be intergalactic spacecraft was caught on closed-circuit television in 2009. Residents of Illinois have made multiple reports to the National UFO Reporting Center..  Thursday is a stellar — make that interstellar? — day for folks who like to search for strange lights and movements in the sky. It's UFO Awareness Day, and witness accounts from Illinois indicate there's plenty to see in the heavens..  The National UFO Reporting Center has hundreds of reports of unidentified flying objects, piquing the curiosity of folks fascinated by the possibility that we're not alone here on Earth and aliens from another galaxy are circling the planet in strange-looking spacecraft..  The notion of intergalactic travel got a boost when information emerged from the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program , a shadowy $22 million Defense Department program that began in 2007 to investigate unidentified aerial phenomena. The multi-year program was shut down in 2012, but the Pentagon released UFO videos earlier this year. Subscribe.  The Pentagon acknowledged the secret program to investigate UFO sightings in 2017, the same year as retired naval Cmdr. David Fravor dramatically recalled a confounding encounter with a UFO when he was conducting a training mission off the coast of California in 2004..  The wingless oblong craft about 40 feet long was flying erratically through his airspace at incredible speed, maneuvering in a way that defies accepted principles of aerodynamics. Fravor didn't know what to make of it but said it was not like anything he had ever seen in nearly 20 years of flying. Subscribe.  He described the UFO as other-worldly ..  ""I can tell you, I think it was not from this world ,"" Fravor told ABC News. ""I'm not crazy, haven't been drinking. It was — after 18 years of flying, I've seen pretty much about everything that I can see in that realm, and this was nothing close."".  Not all accounts are that dramatic, but there are more than a few head-scratchers among the witness accounts..  So far in 2020, 233 UFO reports have been filed from Illinois, according to an analysis of the witness accounts by Satellite Internet, which also factored in data from the U.S. Census Bureau..  Some of the more interesting ones include some incidents reported in the Chicago area : May 2, Naperville: ""Spotted six, meteor-like objects in strange flight pattern half hour after sundown around the moon."" April 26, Naperville: ""We saw about 100 tiny lights like stars flying in a straight line from the west to the east directly over our home. They were very distant and not spaced out evenly there were some singularly spaced some in pairs some in threes. But all flying in a straight line one after another across the sky."" April 21, Chicago: ""Sitting out side in the backyard with family enjoying a fire at night. We looked up at the stars and see a disk shaped light moving across the sky. It was higher then any plane and definitely not a shooting star. It goes far north out of the field of vision. About 5-8 minutes later we see a jet way up in the sky with flashing lights. And behind the plane we see the same disc shaped light trailing behind the plane."" April 17, Manteno: ""My wife and I were sitting in our backyard when my wife thought she saw a shooting star, I turned to look but what we saw was definitely not a shooting star. There were three aircraft flying extremely fast going north without any lights and they made no sound. They flew in a tight formation and then went east and were quickly out of sight because of no lights. They weren't very high up, maybe 15,000 feet. I've never seen anything like it."" March 4, Fairview Heights: ""Husband rushed into the house and made me go outside where six 'stars' were playing in the sky. I kid you not, I watched as they moved all over the place and a plane (passed) under them. It was surreal."".  You can read more UFO sightings from YOUR STATE on the National UFO Reporting Center site..  The Satellite Internet analysis shows that the number of UFO sightings during the first three months of 2020 increased 112 percent from the same period a year earlier. Illinois ranked 46th for UFO sightings in that analysis..  Your chances of seeing a UFO are better in some places than others.

67,"Goodbye, New York, California and Illinois. Hello … Where?.  New York, California and Illinois have been hemorrhaging residents. Almost 3.2 million more people left those states for elsewhere in the U.S. than arrived from other states, from 2010 through 2019, according to population estimates released last week by the Census Bureau. Nine other states saw net out-migration of more than 100,000 people over that period, but none really came close to the big three..  Thanks to 2 million more births than deaths and 1 million newcomers from other countries, California’s population still grew by about 2 million over this period, a gain that trailed only those of Texas and Florida. New York’s population grew but only slightly, while Illinois lost an estimated 159,751 people between 2010 and 2019. Yes, these are all big states, but New York and Illinois ranked second and third in net domestic migration as percentage of 2010 population, behind only Alaska (California ranked 13th)..  Where are all these people going? The Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative Albany think tank, put together some estimates for New York based on data that the Internal Revenue Service gleans from tax returns. (The Census Bureau also releases data on state-to-state migration flows, but those are based on surveys with sometimes-large margins of error, so the IRS numbers are more reliable if less complete.) This inspired me to do the same for California and Illinois.

78,"Reprints Print Getty.  Chicago has moved into the top 10 metro areas nationwide for high-paying jobs, according to U.S. News & World Report. It was ninth last year, up from a tie for 26th in 2018..  The magazine ranked best jobs in 17 categories, from best-paying and best jobs without a college degree to those in sectors such as technology and business..  For its best-pay list, the publication relied on Bureau of Labor Statistics data for 187 occupations. The Chicago metropolitan statistical area, which includes parts of Wisconsin and Indiana, was cited for being among the top five MSAs in 18 job designations. In 2018, it had just seven..  Many of those jobs, however, were not necessarily the highest-paying overall—or that prestigious. Chicago’s winners, reflecting its blue-collar and union traditions, included construction workers, bus drivers and garbage collectors—but also oral and maxillofacial surgeons, biochemists and petroleum engineers..  Other Illinois cities on the list were Champaign (55th), Peoria (58th), Rockford (63rd), Springfield (85th) and Kankakee (156th). San Francisco led the 2019 list with 77 best-paying categories..  Nearly half—46—of the magazine’s 100 best jobs were in health care, benefiting from a combination of high salaries and low unemployment. But for the third consecutive year, software developer topped the list, which takes into account non-monetary factors like growth potential and work-life balance..  In 2015, the Chicago area was 19th on the best-paying list. A magazine spokeswoman cautions against year-to-year comparisons because of ""significant fluctuations in wages."".  In any event, the uptick is reflected in other government stats..  The Census Bureau reported the share of workers making more than $200,000 annually in the metro area jumped to 9.2 percent after 2014 from 6.7 percent during the previous four years. Besides the impact of inflation, though, the results could be skewed by a disproportionate number of workers crossing the threshold.

84,"The total number of coronavirus cases in Illinois topped 20,000 this Easter Sunday, but Gov. JB Pritzker said the evidence shows the state is stabilizing or bending the curve when it comes to infections..  Pritzker said there were 1,672 new cases on Sunday, for a total of 20,852 confirmed COVID-19 cases statewide..  Another 43 people have died of the virus, for a total of 720 fatalities since the beginning of the pandemic..  Pritzker said there are now known COVID-19 cases in 86 of Illinois’ 102 counties..  But despite the high number of new cases on Sunday, Pritzker emphasized that the numbers actually show a positive sign..  “First, the number of tests completed for today has reached its highest number ever at 7,956 for the last 24 hours,” Pritzker said. “That’s almost halfway between the 6,000 that we’ve been averaging lately and the 10,000 I have set for the next goal.”.  That shows evidence that the infection rate is stabilizing or the curve is being bent, he said. Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike – who had the day off for Easter Sunday – had previously said the cases are no longer growing exponentially..  Pritzker said the number of COVID-19 tests that have come back positive is almost exactly the same as it has been for the last two weeks, and the death toll on Sunday is lower than it has been in six days..  The governor said he prays the trends continue, and if they do, people adhering to the stay-at-home order will be to credit. He noted that Illinois was the second state to issue such an order, and experts say it “now seems to be reaching a peaking term.”.  But he said experts agree it is necessary to stay the course “to make sure that we’re keeping the progress going that we’ve already made.”.  Pritzker also emphasized the importance of celebrations of faith on Easter Sunday being modified so people stay at home and find virtual ways to interact..  “I believe passionately that adapting our expression of faith in these times is one of the most faithful acts of all – to hold our beliefs steadfast even as we defend ourselves against unprecedented challenges,” Pritzker said..  Pritzker also thanked Tim Cook and Apple as the company delivered 100,000 N95 masks this weekend to support health care workers and first responders..  He also advised everyone at home that Sunday is a great day to go online and take 10 minutes to fill out their Census forms at 2020Census.gov..  Pritzker also addressed what it might look like when business opens back up in Illinois. He said discussions have been in progress about that very subject..  “It’s a question of how and when,” Pritzker said. “Now, the ‘when’ would be frankly determined by when the curve starts to turn down, that we see significant progress.”.  Still, Pritzker said there will have been a low percentage of people exposed, so there will not be herd immunity..  Once it is safe, the question becomes how to operate society while bringing down the level of infection as people go back to work. He said his office is talking to industry leaders, economists, and most importantly scientists..  But Pritzker emphasized, “The last thing we want is to begin to open things up, and then have a big spike of infections, and then unfortunately all the spikes that come with that – including a spike in deaths.” \","[0.643627941608429, 0.35637208819389343]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.643627941608429
85,"Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Sunday that nearly three-quarters of people who have died of COVID-19 in Chicago were Black despite the fact the city’s population is just 30% African American..  Lightfoot, who made the comments on CBS’ “ Face The Nation ,” said she directed that those administering COVID-19 tests in the city to also begin to record demographic information of the people being tested..  “You start by making sure you’ve got the data,” Lightfoot, who has been Chicago’s mayor since last year, said..  According to data from the US Census Bureau , Chicago’s population is 49% white and 30% Black..  Lightfoot said she’s created a “racial equity rapid response team” comprised of healthcare providers, public health clinicians, and “community stakeholders” like faith leaders..  “We have street intervention folks who normally work on responding to violence. We are going all-in in a hyper-local focus to make sure that we are tapping into those neighborhoods where there’s a high death rate, where there’s a high positive test rate,” she said..  Lightfoot noted that “this is an issue that is not unique to Chicago, unfortunately.”.  “We’re seeing similar kinds of numbers reported across the country in large urban centers,” she said. “The answer that we believe is right is because of the underlying conditions that people of color, and particularly black folks, suffer from.”.  Lightfoot added: “Whether it’s diabetes, heart disease, upper respiratory illnesses, the kind of things we’ve been talking about for a long time that plague black Chicago, that lead to life expectancy gaps. This virus attacks those underlying conditions with a vengeance.”.  Health experts have said the virus may have a disproportionate impact on the African American community because members of that demographic are more likely to live in poverty and to have pre-existing health conditions , which can worsen the effects of COVID-19..  An analysis from The Washington Post found that in places in the US where COVID-19 demographic data are available, counties with a majority-black have three times the rate of infection and about six times the rate of deaths as counties with a majority of white residents..  On Friday, US Surgeon General Jerome Adams acknowledged the disproportionate impact preliminary data has shown..  “We do not think people of color are biologically or genetically disposed to get COVID-19,” Adams said. “But they are socially predisposed to coronavirus exposure and to have a higher incidence of the very diseases that put you at risk for severe complications from coronavirus.”.  He added: “It’s alarming but it’s not surprising that people of color have a greater burden of chronic health conditions.”","[0.8877052068710327, 0.11229479312896729]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.8877052068710327

Illinois also saw 1,672 new confirmed cases in the past day, bringing the total number in the state to 20,852. Pritzker said many of those people have already recovered..  Pritzker noted the percentage of people whose tests came back positive has been consistent despite more testing being done, suggesting Illinois is making progress and could see case levels begin to drop. So far, Illinois has done 100,735 coronavirus tests..  “I’ve spoken before about a stabilizing or a bending of the curve, and today is one more piece of evidence that it may indeed be happening,” Pritzker said at his daily media briefing. “The percent of those tests that came up positive is almost exactly the same as it has been for the latest two weeks.

He also said the state is looking at ways to increase vote-by-mail and early voting for the general election in November..  And though Pritzker didn’t reveal plans for how Illinois could “reopen” once coronavirus slows here, he said he is speaking to scientists, economists and business industry leaders about how that can be done. So far, Illinois’ stay at home order is set to be in place through April 30, and Pritzker has previously said he is unlikely to lift it before then..  Pritzker noted his belief that less than 20 percent of the people in Illinois have been exposed to coronavirus and recovered from it, so the state is not at “herd immunity” levels..  “How do you operate society when we’ve begun to bring down the level of infection and make sure people are able to begin to go back to work in various industries?” Pritzker said. “The last thing we want is to begin to open things up and then have a big spike in infections and, unfortunately, all the spikes that come with that, including a spike in death. We want to make sure we’re not doing that while looking at how we can get people back to work.” Symptoms.  Coronavirus can be deadly, but the vast majority of cases have been mild . Those most at risk from the virus are people who are elderly or who have underlying health conditions..  Symptoms of coronavirus can appear two to 14 days after a person has been exposed to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control. People with no symptoms may have the virus and spread it to others..  The virus spreads between people through coughing and sneezing, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health..  The most common symptoms: Cough Shortness of breath.  People have also experienced body aches, nasal congestion, runny nose and sore throat, according to Harvard Medical School ..  If you or someone else has difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, become confused, cannot be roused or develop a bluish face or lips, get immediate medical attention, according to the CDC. How To Protect Yourself.  Here’s what you can actually do to prevent getting ill: The CDC and other officials have said people should wash their hands often, including before, during and after eating; after using the bathroom; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.The CDC has a guide here for how to properly wash your hands.

If you can’t wash your hands with soap and water, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health. Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands. Clean and disinfect objects and surfaces you touch frequently, like cellphones and light switches. Here are tips from the CDC. Stay home when you’re sick and avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you have to sneeze or cough with a tissue, throw it out immediately after using it, according to the CDC. What To Do If You Think You’re Sick.  Even if you’re not showing symptoms, the Chicago Department of Public Health recommends people coming from high-risk countries ( here’s a CDC list) self-quarantine for 14 days after returning home..  If you do have symptoms of coronavirus, contact your primary doctor or a health care facility before going in. Explain your symptoms and tell them if you’ve come into close contact with anyone with coronavirus or traveled to an area where COVID-19 is widespread ( here’s a CDC list) within the last 14 days, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health..  From there, the experts will work with your local health department to determine what to do and if you need to be tested for coronavirus, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health..

91,"From The Center Square.  By Austin Berg.  ILLINOIS — Gov. J.B. Pritzker sent out one of the most popular tweets of his term following Iowa's caucus debacle Monday night, calling for Illinois to replace the Hawkeye State in holding the nation's first presidential primary elections in 2024..  Illinois has some work to do before taking that torch..  After all, the Illinois Secretary of State's office is scrambling to explain how hundreds of people who identified themselves as non-U.S. citizens ended up on the voter rolls , how thousands of ineligible 16-year-olds had their information sent to election officials, and how hundreds of formerly incarcerated Illinoisans had their voter registrations mistakenly canceled ..  Beyond that, Iowa remains the electoral envy of Illinois on at least one important measure: fair maps..  House Speaker Mike Madigan first rose to the speakership in 1983 through his mapmaking prowess, and has used the power of that pen to reward allies and punish enemies for three of the last four decades..  That doesn't happen in Iowa..  In fact, Madigan's former chief of staff Tim Mapes went toe-to-toe with Iowa's Senate president in a mapmaking debate four years ago . The two in 2016 spoke on a panel in Chicago sponsored by the National Council of State Legislatures..  ""Legislators like to be involved in this state on how they frame their districts. Whether they like all of it is another thing,"" Mapes said. ""But they like to be involved, and it's still a big part of what we do."".  Meanwhile, Iowa has an independent commission draw the state's legislative map every decade..  ""The legislature has absolutely nothing to say about how these lines are drawn. Just 'yay' or 'nay,'"" said former Iowa Senate President Pam Jochum, a Democrat. She boasted that Iowa's maps have not been challenged in court since 1970..  ""Senator, great ideas for Iowa,"" Mapes responded. ""But they're a little different in Illinois."".  Mapes has since been ousted from Madigan's office amid allegations of sexual harassment..  Pritzker ran on ending Mapes' flippant retort..  During his gubernatorial campaign, he told Springfield political blogger Rich Miller that he would veto any map ""that is in any way drafted or created by legislators, political party leaders and/or their staffs or allies."" He also said Illinois should amend the constitution to create an independent commission to draw political maps following the 2020 census..  The governor is now going back on that promise. He didn't mention maps at all in his recent State of the State address. And when asked about it, he pledged only to ""veto any unfair map that gets presented to me."" That leaves a world of daylight for Madigan shenanigans..  The most popular effort in the General Assembly to establish fair maps — a bipartisan constitutional amendment filed by Democratic state Sen. Julie Morrison — has not received Pritzker's blessing..  Some political insiders have pushed back on independent mapmaking for what they claim are pragmatic reasons, noting that on some measures Illinois gerrymandering is not as extreme as it is in other states..  But purely mathematical measures of mapmaking don't account for the problem at hand: the power of political leaders to favor some lawmakers and punish others through boundary lines, or the perception of such power..  Fair maps would chip away at this privilege for the state's most powerful politicians..  Another pushback is that Pritzker shouldn't put a redistricting constitutional amendment on the ballot in November, as it may muddy the waters for his progressive income tax hike referendum..  Of course, Illinois voters would love an opportunity to support fair maps at the ballot box. But instead of a constitutional amendment, Pritzker could instead ask the General Assembly to simply pass a statute establishing an independent map commission. That commission would draw a map on which lawmakers would vote up or down. No constitutional amendment required..  That's what Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is poised to do. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel infamously drew one hostile alderman's home out of his ward after the 2010 census. Since taking office, Lightfoot has pushed for an independent citizens' commission to redraw Chicago's 50-ward map..  At the state level, former Democratic state Sen. Martin Sandoval first took his seat in Springfield thanks to the remap following the 2000 census and Madigan's political clout . The speaker was seeking support from Hispanic political leaders for his daughter's run for Illinois attorney general, so he ensured Sandoval faced no opponents in the 2002 Democratic primary for the newly drawn 12th Senate district on Chicago's Southwest Side..  On Jan. 28, Sandoval pleaded guilty on federal charges of bribery and tax fraud, and faces up to 13 years in prison..  Illinois might be looking down its nose at Iowa this week. But until the Land of Lincoln gets its own house in order, that pride should be short lived.","[0.5008968114852905, 0.4991031885147095]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5008968114852905

97,"Jen-chien Yu, a student in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s Master of Computer Science in Data Science (MCS-DS) program, is a wonderful example of how online learners can immediately start to apply their new knowledge to their professional field. Yu has been able to apply skills in areas of study like Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Data Mining, and Cloud Computing to her work in library assessment, a field that aims to measure and leverage the performance and resources of libraries..  We sat down with Yu, who is the Director of Library Assessment for the University Library at the U of I – which holds one of the largest collections among public institutions in the U.S., and had her tell us more about the field, her interest in data, the applicability of her coursework to her profession, and her advice for potential MCS-DS students..  Yu describes the purpose of library assessment in higher education as endeavoring to “measure the performance of libraries.” This involves looking at metrics like the size of a library’s collection, how many people come into the library, how people interact with the library’s services, and how satisfied people are with the library. It also involves looking at a library’s many data sets..  Prior to joining the U of I seven years ago, Yu, was a social science data librarian at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. There, she worked with faculty and students from sociology and political science and helped them find data sets, like public opinion polls, census data, or election records, and analyze the vast amounts of stored information..  This close proximity to data in both positions is what sparked Yu’s interest in getting a Master of Computer Science in Data Science. Yu uses concepts from her MCS-DS courses on a regular basis in the library. Often, she will have faculty members or students come to her and say “I have this particular issue, do you have any data to back it up?” Previously, by locating the data, Yu provided a starting point for many people’s research, but now, with her mastery over algorithms that she learned in the MCS-DS program, she can also assist with the analysis. “They come to me and say, ‘I have a huge amount of data, I don’t know how to analyze it, can you help me look at it?’ I help customize it to what they want to do, or clean it up, a lot of what I do is data-cleaning.” Techniques from MCS-DS courses like cluster analysis and principal component analysis help Yu work with the library visitor’s data set to enable them to extract the information they are looking for. Both methods discern the fastest way to group or organize large, untamed sets of variable-heavy data. “These two particular algorithms I could use immediately with the library’s data,” Yu says..  For Yu, combining knowledge with enthusiasm is a key to success. “Graduate students ask me, ‘What is the key thing to learn in the data science field?’ I think it’s easy to say go learn python, or go learn R. Those are important, but I don’t think that’s the question you want to think about. It doesn’t matter how popular a certain tool is at the time, it will fade.” Data scientists “need to be willing to dig in and say, ‘There must be a structure here, let me figure it out,’ and then ask ‘What kind of questions can I ask of this data?’ or ‘What kind of analysis can I do with this data?’” She continues, “If you don’t have that drive to understand the structure and be able to pick the right tools, then you won’t enjoy or pursue a long career in this field.”.  An interest in data brought Yu to the MCS-DS, but, as a full-time working professional with two small children, the flexibility of the program has also been incredibly important. She enjoys the short, modular format of the videos, as it makes reviewing tricky concepts easy. She also enjoys being able to download lectures and listen to them while driving her family around, as it helps her balance her professional, academic, and family life. “That is what is great about online, the program makes it easy for a professional to jump on this,” says Yu..  When asked what advice Yu has for others who are thinking about studying data science she laughed and said, “Your comfort level with math should not be the indicator for whether or not you are suitable for this major — everybody should try it.” Trying data science with a mindset of interest and excitement is Yu’s strongest message. “Data science can apply to a lot of different disciplines, if you have that drive to work with data.” “Try it,” she repeats. “Just try it and see.”.  ——–.  You don’t have to wait to get started towards your MCS-DS degree — you can try out an open course online and begin learning today . If you later apply and are admitted to the degree program, your assignments completed in open courses can count toward completion of degree courses .","[0.5002442598342896, 0.4997557997703552]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5002442598342896

HYDE PARK — The second phase of the Harper Court development project, which will bring a 17-story tower with office and laboratory space to Hyde Park, is expected to break ground in mid-to-late 2020..  Some minor changes to previous plans were announced at a community meeting held by Ald. Sophia King (4th) Wednesday, alongside proposals that have yet to be finalized..  Maryland-based developer Wexford Science and Technology will own the new structure, to be built over an existing building at 5235 S. Harper Court. The company also developed the University Technology Park at the Illinois Institute of Technology..  The University of Chicago will be a tenant, occupying about 20 percent of the new building with one floor of office space and one floor of lab space..  Wexford is pursuing research and educational institutions to fill the rest of the building, but tenants have not been finalized finalized, said Angie Marks, associate vice president of commercial real estate operations for the University of Chicago. The layout of the second phase of the Harper Court development. It’s overlaid with yellow and dashed lines showing past designs. Maxwell Evans/Block Club Chicago.  In late 2017, the university announced the U.S. Army Research Laboratory would operate a regional headquarters for technology development out of the project..  The Army is still “a potential tenant” but “has not signed on” to occupy space, King said..  A community engagement fund, supported by a fee assessed to tenants, will generate $140,000 annually. That money will pay for partnerships with local schools, like student internships and a program director to oversee youth participation in STEM fields..  “We also want a space where our youth can call home,” King said. “In the building, they can obviously interact with the professionals who are there, but they’ll also have their own space.”.  STEM programming at Harper Court “would open many doors” for Hyde Park’s youth, Harold Washington College freshman Marshall Callery said..  Callery is pursuing an acting career, but said he maintains interest in the sciences. He said he would have enjoyed the opportunity to participate in something similar to the plans for Harper Court as a high-schooler..  “You can always build on top of that — you can add more programming,” Callery said. “I think it’s a really good idea.”.  The fund will also subsidize 5,000 square feet of office space, which will be made available to local businesses at a 20 percent discount. Wexford is contributing $300,000 to open the community fund..  The finished project will stand 17 stories and 241 feet tall, which one resident worried would block the sun from reaching nearby homes..  For reference, the nearby City Hyde Park development stands about 170 feet tall, and the existing Harper Court structure is about 150 feet..  Initial plans for the second phase, drafted in 2010 , called for a 26-story condominium tower. The height has already been drastically lowered to address community feedback, King said..  King and the developers are discussing ways to make the surrounding area more pedestrian-friendly. One option would be to close East Harper Court — in front of the Jolly Pumpkin and Native Foods — to car traffic and “activate” the space for pedestrians, King said. The existing traffic flow (left) and a proposal to make Harper Court more pedestrian friendly. The arrows indicate the current flow of car traffic. Maxwell Evans/Block Club Chicago.  Groundbreaking is planned for late summer or early fall of 2020, according to Wexford attorney Langdon Neal. He said the developers are finalizing construction logistics and would like to hold another meeting once a plan is in place..  The former home of Park 52 , 5201 S. Harper Ave., will be demolished and used as a staging area for the project’s construction, according to Marks. The site’s future after that is undetermined..  The lab space Harper Court will provide is crucial, as a “massive undermet need” for it in Chicago is driving research and development companies out of the city, attendee Shawn Ursini said..  The McKinley Park resident doesn’t live nearby, but sees the project as “a small part of [the] equation” in improving the citywide economy..  “Research and development companies are leaving because there’s nowhere for them to grow here,” Ursini said. “This is potential for us to not only retain some jobs, but also the revenue that’s associated with them.”.  The Harper Court development is “a good thing all around,” King said. In a period of consistent population loss in the city, “to not only retain jobs, but to increase density in our community — it’s a great thing.”.  Do stories like this matter to you?

102,"The application deadline is approaching for one of the key programs driving the state’s equity-centric approach to marijuana legalization, and the state is looking to hire hundreds from disadvantaged communities to review those applications..  The R3 – Restore, Reinvest and Renew – Program has $31.5 million in grants available for organizations in communities disproportionately impacted by poverty, gun violence or the war on drugs, and the deadline to apply is Monday, July 20..  During a livestreamed town hall event Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Julianna Stratton said the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, or ICJIA, is looking to hire up to 300 residents from R3-eligible areas to help review grant proposals..  “This process has been rooted in equity every step of the way. We didn’t want the reviewers to be from somewhere else, somebody who doesn’t have a connection to the community,” Stratton said. “We want the reviewers to come directly from the community.”.  R3-eligible areas are determined by two sets of criteria. The first includes rates of gun injuries, child poverty, unemployment and incarceration; and the second set requires a Disproportionately Impacted Area designation by the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. There are 683 census tracts designated as Disproportionately Impacted Areas in Illinois based on high rates of arrest, conviction and incarceration related to marijuana, among other factors..  An interactive map of eligible areas is available on the R3 website at https://r3.illinois.gov/eligibility ..  The method of disbursing grants via R3 was crafted by the ICJIA and the Justice, Equity and Opportunity, or JEO, Initiative, which was created via executive order last year to centralize the state’s efforts at criminal justice reform and is led by Stratton..  The ICJIA is the state agency responsible for administering grants and conducting research relating to criminal justice. The two agencies worked in tandem to craft the process of grant disbursement and eligibility for R3..  “We have tried to create a program that allows everyone to apply. Nonprofit, local units of government, faith-based organizations, churches, small businesses and community organizations,” Quinn Rallins, director of the JEO Initiative, said during Tuesday’s town hall..  Any organization that works within an R3-eligible zone can apply for a grant, as long as their proposal falls within one of the five areas of the plan: Civil legal aid, economic development, re-entry for those in the prison system, violence prevention and youth development..  Organizations applying for state funds normally must be compliant with the state’s Grant Accountability and Transparency Act, or GATA. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the difficulty some groups may have becoming GATA compliant in time for the July 20 deadline as a result of it, the R3 program has created a process for non-GATA compliant organizations to still get access to grants..  Groups can apply individually or as a collaborative if multiple organizations are working on the same program. Under R3’s guidelines, only the lead organization listed in a collaborative proposal needs to be GATA compliant for all member groups to receive the grant..  The R3 program, which was created as part of state legislation legalizing marijuana, invests 25 percent of tax revenue from adult-use cannabis into communities most impacted by mass incarceration and the war on drugs. The program’s first $31.5 million in grant funding comes from a $35-million appropriation from the General Revenue Fund to the ICJIA for the 2021 Fiscal Year..  Information on how to apply can be found at https://r3.illinois.gov/ ..  Since January, Illinois has brought in $52 million from taxes on legalized marijuana sales, according to a Tuesday news release from the governor’s office. By law, a quarter of that income and subsequent cannabis-tax revenue will fund future R3 grants..  The marijuana legalization bill was also designed to allow social equity applicants who are from the impacted communities to break into ownership of the marijuana industry. That has not happened yet, as new licenses for dispensaries due to be granted on May 1 and craft grow licenses due to be granted on July 1 have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic..  On Wednesday, Gov. JB Pritzker said he is hopeful movement would be realized “in the next six weeks” – give or take a week or two..  “No new licenses are given until these social equity licenses are given,” Pritzker said at an unrelated news conference in Chicago. “So we want to make sure that we're getting accomplished as fast as possible the, you know, people of color, having the opportunity to enter this industry to own and to work in this industry.”.

JB Pritzker encouraged Illinoisans to complete the 2020 U.S. Census and touted a state investment in youth employment programs Thursday during two public appearances in Rockford..  The state has a 66.9 percent census self-response rate currently. That’s nearly 5 percentage points better than the 62.1 percent national rate, but well below the state’s 2010 final self-reporting tally of 70.5 percent. In 2000, the self-response rate in Illinois was 69 percent..  Pritzker’s message at the Rockford City Market was that filling out the census is “an act of civic engagement” that has a direct effect on the amount of federal funding the state receives. In turn, an undercount often disproportionately impacts the neediest communities in the state, which typically have lower response rates..  “The same ZIP codes that are impacted the worst by COVID-19 — those that have been hurting for generations — are on track to be the most undercounted at a time when frankly we need full funding,” he said..  A 1 percent undercount for the state could result in it losing $195 million per year in federal funding for the next decade, Pritzker said. That equates to about $1,500 per year in federal funding lost for each person not counted in the census..  Based upon the 2010 count, the state collects $34 billion in federal funds annually, the governor added..  This year’s numbers have Illinois tied with Virginia for seventh among all states. The response portal will be open until Oct. 31 due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic..  Pritzker signed an executive order last year dedicating $29 million to the census outreach effort through the Illinois Department of Human Services..  The outreach is done through a “hub and spoke” model in which funding passes through IDHS to 31 intermediary organizations that lead outreach efforts in 12 regions of the state. Those organizations partner with other community groups to target outreach at a hyperlocal level..  “We're working with trusted messengers and grassroots community organizations to focus on personalized targeted outreach groups,” Pritzker said..  While the governor said the census has historically “not been an accessible tool,” leaving “too many people locked out and left behind,” he pointed out that there is no citizenship question on the census form and organizers are doing all they can to make communities that are fearful of such a question comfortable in filling out the form..  “It's been incredibly uplifting and inspiring to see so many Illinoisans taking to the streets to demand justice, so I need everyone to know, filling out the census is an act of engagement,” he said..  In May, however, some of those census community organizers told Capitol News Illinois their outreach efforts have been stymied by the pandemic and associated stay-at-home orders. Youth Employment Program.  Earlier Thursday, Pritzker spoke at the Lockwood Park equestrian center and children’s farm to tout a COVID-19 Summer Youth Employment Program. The state dedicated $9.3 million through the Illinois Department of Human Services to support the program to employ 2,400 young adults statewide between June and August 2020, helping them train for and find work..  The program is geared toward low-income youth who live in high-poverty communities and counties hardest hit by the pandemic. Job opportunities through the program are coordinated by community-based organizations in partnership with IDHS..  “COVID-19 has completely turned the working world on its head — but young people still deserve a chance to start building their future. In fact, it’s more important than ever to ensure the most vulnerable among us don’t slip through the cracks,” Pritzker said. “That’s why last month, my administration announced a redesigned $9.3 million COVID-19 Summer Youth Employment Program, supporting dozens of projects across some of the counties hit hardest by the pandemic — projects that, across the board, will employ thousands of young people in need of an opportunity.”.  Pritzker was also asked about the progress on a Rockford casino, and said while he does not have an exact date as to when the Illinois Gaming Board will sign off on applications from potential casino operators, he is hopeful it occurs “certainly over the next couple of months.” He said it must be done by October, per the law’s deadlines..  The governor said the Gaming Board was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, just like everything else. Now that it is back at work, it’s dealt with a number of backlogged issues. It’s important, he said, because revenues from the gambling expansion bill passed last year are to fund infrastructure programs throughout the state..  “(IGB) just got up and running the sports wagering in the state,… a difficult thing to get done but they did, and expanded video gaming terminals in the state, another part of our capital program,” he said. “And then of course, we want very badly to make sure that our casinos get up and running. It’s economic development, its job creation, it’s opportunity. And of course, it's also revenue for the capital projects that we so badly need.” Close","[0.5235462784767151, 0.4764537513256073]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5235462784767151

The press secretary had noted Chicago’s ongoing problem with violence during the briefing Thursday, responding to a question by pointing out how the president has to focus on “Democrat cities not controlling their streets.”.  The surge in gun violence in the city, which President Trump called out as “worse than Afghanistan” this week, has led to a 48% increase in murders since this time last year, according to police department statistics..  “I’ve listed for you the names of these kids who have died across this country. It is unacceptable, and under this President, he’ll take action,” McEnany said in response to a question. “And the derelict mayor of Chicago should step up and ask for federal help because she’s doing a very poor job at securing her streets.”.  Lightfoot slammed Trump for his criticism last month, accusing him of trying to score “cheap political points” and declaring that “I don’t need leadership lessons from Donald Trump.” Earlier this month, the Democrat addressed the skyrocketing crimes in her city, where more than a dozen people died over the July Fourth weekend, telling CNN that COVID-19 has been a contributing factor to the increase..  Back in May, Lightfoot had displayed her disrespect for the president during a news briefing..  “I will encode what I really want to say to Donald Trump.

108,"Expanded testing, mask wearing, limited detainee movement and opening up unused buildings to allow for distancing slowed the spread within the jail.  By Megan Crepeau and Annie Sweeney Chicago Tribune.  COOK COUNTY, Ill. — The Cook County Jail successfully beat back its outbreak of COVID-19 even as the virus spread dramatically outside its walls, according to a new paper authored by medical officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and various county offices..  Early in the pandemic, the jail had “one of the largest outbreaks of COVID-19 in a congregate setting described to date,” according to the document. The COVID-19 quarantine tier with single cells at Division 11 of the Cook County Jail. (Photo/Zbigniew Bzdak of Chicago Tribune via TNS).  But after expanded testing, mask-wearing, limiting detainee movement and opening up previously unused buildings to allow for greater distancing, the spread within the jail slowed down significantly compared with Chicago at large, the paper said..  While officials could not pinpoint exactly which action was most effective, the cumulative result was successful, according to the examination of the jail..  “When this thing hit, I just threw everything I could come up with (at it),” Sheriff Tom Dart told the Tribune in an interview late Tuesday after the paper was initially made public. “… it was like, no, we’ve got to find out what we can do, and we’ve got to do it in the quickest and most massive way.”.  The paper has not yet undergone peer review, and its authors include medical experts from the jail’s health center and the sheriff’s office, along with the CDC and the University of Illinois at Chicago..  Even to an outsider’s eye, however, the drop in COVID-19 cases at the jail is significant. In March and April, the jail counted more than 900 cases among detainees and staffers. Seven detainees died at local hospitals after testing positive..  But as of Tuesday, only 11 detainees out of about 4,800 are positive, Dart said, and eight of them entered the jail with the virus..  “We’re testing at the door now,” he said. “You could literally say being in the jail is one of the safest places to be right now.”.  After widespread efforts among prosecutors, judges and defense attorneys to get more detainees out on bond, the jail population dropped significantly — enough to facilitate the social distancing that was effective in slowing the virus’s spread, Dart noted..  Dart warned that the progress could be reversed if the population increases much more. There are about 438 people in county jail simply awaiting transfer to state prisons, which are still not taking new transfers due to the pandemic..  “I’ve tested every one of them, they’re in quarantine, isolation,” Dart said, “… these people are free of COVID, they’re not going to present a problem in downstate Illinois.”.  The new paper also noted that jail staffers played an “important role” in bringing the virus into the jail — echoing what several activists alleged in their efforts to empty the facility..  Positive COVID-19 cases among staffers “often preceded cases in detained persons,” the CDC review states. Most of the jail’s buildings saw a staff member test positive first, and then, a median of three days later, a detainee..  Sheriff’s staffers working at the jail were screened for symptoms beginning at the end of March, and required to wear surgical masks in early April. But testing for staffers was not mandatory..  Dart said it was not within his power to force correctional officers to get tested, though his office encouraged and facilitated as much testing as it could..  “I don’t think you’re going to get case zero as far as (identifying the) one person bringing it in,” he said. “All of us felt there were multiple entry points, and the nature of this virus is so insidious.”.  ———","[0.5122711658477783, 0.4877287745475769]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5122711658477783

110,"As violent crime continues to increase in Chicago, Mayor Lightfoot has found yet another way to avoid addressing the issue–she’s bashing the White House Press Secretary..  We’ve seen that the Mayor of Chicago has been focusing on enforcing lockdowns and compliance with the 2020 Census with silly stunts instead of dealing with the real issue in Chicago–the spike in homicides..  Violent crime in the city of Chicago has been ramping up in recent years..  In the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis and the wave of anti-racism turned anti-law enforcement protests that swept across the country, a disturbing rise in violent crime has also followed..  On May 30, the city of Chicago recorded it’s most deadly day in 60 years– 18 people were murdered and another 85 people were shot in one 24-hour period..  The Chicago Sun-Times maintains a database of every homicide victim in the Windy City for 2020. It lists the name, age, gender, race, location, date, and cause of death. It’s heartbreaking to read through knowing that each of those names represents a life, and has left mourning family members and friends. To date, there have been 387 homicides in Chicago in 2020..  For some reason, the city that has been run exclusively by Democrats for decades isn’t getting any better tackling the rampant violence in any meaningful way. Perhaps there’s a reason hidden in there somewhere….  But this is a thing that people are not permitted to say, apparently..  White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was on the receiving end of Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s ire when she dared suggest that the mayor do her job. Chicago’s Mayor Lori Lightfoot hit out at White House press secretary Kaleigh McEnany Thursday calling her a ‘Karen’ for saying she’s a ‘derelict mayor’. McEnany was answering reporter questions during a press briefing earlier Thursday when she made several sharp comments about the mayor and accused her of ‘doing a very poor job at securing her streets’. The press secretary also said she believed Lightfoot should ask for federal help in ending a recent spike in violence in Chicago. Mayor Lightfoot bluntly responded to the Press Secretary’s comments on Twitter, “Hey, Karen. Watch your mouth.”.  — Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) July 16, 2020.  Is anyone going to mention that calling someone a “Karen” on the internet has become a racial slur?.  The internet pejorative calling people “Karen” has taken on a racial connotation as it is generally used to describe pushy, privileged, middle-aged white women who complain about everything and are potentially racist. People suggested that it was “racism” that prompted “Central Park Karen” to threatened to call the police on a black bird watcher after both individuals behaved badly in the exchange..  The Chicago-Sun Times published the urban dictionary definition of Karen as “the stereotypical name associated with rude, obnoxious and insufferable middle-aged white women,” and reported that a source close to Lightfoot confirmed that the Mayor used the term “in that context.”.  Mayor Lightfoot is admitting to using a racial slur. Got it..  All because she didn’t like getting called out by the White House Press Secretary. McEnany was later asked about a previous comment made by Trump that white people are killed just as often as black people by police officers. During the course of her answer, the press secretary again brought up recent violence in Chicago. ‘I’ve listed for you the names of these kids who have died across this country. It is unacceptable, and under this President, he’ll take action,’ she said. ‘And the derelict mayor of Chicago should step up and ask for federal help because she’s doing a very poor job at securing her streets.’.  Where is McEnany wrong, precisely?.  This is why Mayor Lightfoot simply tweeted, “Hey, Karen. Watch your mouth,” instead of attempting to refute McEnany’s statements. It’s because she can’t , so the Mayor wants her to be quiet..  President Trump has made law and order a key pillar in his 2020 re-election campaign..  In June, the President sent a letter to both Mayor Lightfoot and Illinois Governor Pritzker to address the violent crime in Chicago. In the letter, he offers to assist Chicago as long as they tackle the crime, “Unlike previous Administrations of both parties, I am willing to tackle unsolved challenges. If you are willing to put partisanship aside, we can revitalize distressed neighborhoods in Chicago, together. But to succeed, you must establish law and order.” He added, “My Administration would also welcome the opportunity to engage with you and your colleagues as you develop bipartisan policy recommendations to improve policing and make our great cities safer for all.”.  Can’t you see how the left’s “Bad Orange Man” is exerting his authority over the residents of Chicago and establishing totalitarian rule by the federal government against the will of the people? Oh, wait. That’s not happening at all. He’s calling for actual bipartisan input to solve the city’s problem..  On Wednesday, he addressed the situation in major cities and the federal response to the negligence of leadership in those cities..  ‘We’ll have another announcement next week with the Attorney General, the FBI, and others concerning our cities, because the left-wing group of people that are running our cities are not doing the job that they’re supposed to be doing,’ Trump said. ‘And it’s not a very tough job to do if they knew what they were doing. So we’ll be talking about that next week and probably have an announcement as to what we’re planning to do to help them. They’re supposed to be asking for help, and they don’t want to ask,’ he added, referring to Mayor Lightfoot and her refusal to call for federal aid.","[0.5068134069442749, 0.4931865632534027]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5068134069442749

112,"Soon after Princess Gonzales started dating Maribel Saenz three years ago, disaster struck: 240 pounds of tiles fell on Gonzales’s left knee, cutting her tile setter apprenticeship short. Gonzales earned enough through the apprenticeship to support Saenz. The two of them together now work around 80 hours a week while raising three daughters — and still struggle to make ends meet. “We’re living day to day,” said Saenz. Gonzales and Saenz aren’t the only Chicago family struggling to afford the basics. In Chicago, 44% of all households don’t earn enough to cover essentials like housing, child care, food, transportation and health care while saving for the future, according to a study published Wednesday by the United Way, one of the country’s largest nonprofit organizations. The report is an attempt to provide a clearer picture of how many families in Illinois struggle to make ends meet even if they live above the official poverty line and don’t qualify for federal or state benefits like Medicaid and SNAP. “The federal poverty line can be really misleading. It assumes costs of living are the same across the country, which doesn’t really make sense,” said Ashley Anglin, the director of research at United Way. Anglin coauthored the report with help from researchers at DePaul University, the Federal Reserve of Chicago and the Illinois Department of Employment Security, among other groups. Those researchers collected data from a dozen state and federal government sources to figure out how many people are ALICE, which stands for “Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed.” “We determined what was the bare bones costs of living in every county and major city in the state and figured out the number of households in poverty as well as that portion that we call ALICE in each,” Anglin said..  The share of ALICE households — Asset Limited, Income Constrained and Employed — is greater in majority black and Latino neighborhoods across Chicago. The numbers of the map correspond to the 77 community areas. United Way The report shows how economic hardship mirrors patterns of racial segregation in Chicago. In the Near North Side, for instance, a quarter of households struggle to afford basic needs, compared to 70% in South Shore. In Brighton Park, a neighborhood in the Southwest Side where Gonzales, Saenz and their three daughters share a three-bedroom apartment, 60% of households can’t cover necessities. “Our work illustrates just how noticeable inequality is for people who live in Chicago, how there’s just a different reality depending on where you live in the city,” Anglin said. Across Illinois, while 12 percent of families are in poverty, 36 percent are ALICE, according to the report. And like in Chicago, some areas of the state struggle a lot more than others. In Waukegan, for example, 57% of households fall below the threshold, compared to 18% in Naperville..  A third of households in Illinois live below the ALICE threshold, meaning they struggle to afford basic necessities. United Way Their findings point to an uneven economic recovery in the decade after the Great Recession. While the vast majority of working-age people in Illinois are employed, the report found that 56% of those jobs pay under $20 an hour. And as wages stagnate, job insecurity is up across the board, making it hard for workers to pay off rising monthly expenses while saving enough money for a secure future. “There are so many families who aren’t in deep poverty but make a litany of tough decisions every day,” Anglin said. “Families are asking themselves if they should get groceries this week or buy medicine? Get the car fixed or take your kids out of daycare?”.  From the left: Zaira Medel, Princess Gonzales, Naiovy Medel, Maribel Saenz, and Arlett Medel at their apartment in Brighton Park, March 4, 2020.

The two are also paid canvassers for a U.S. Census awareness campaign through the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, a community organization. Four days out of the week, Gonzales works at their youngest daughter’s elementary school for two hours in the morning as a teacher’s aid, which pays her $500 a semester. In the meantime, Saenz prepares food for the day at home and sometimes heads out to clean apartments on her own. “Sometimes we only we get one unit a week. It’s so unstable,” she said. Gonzales is in the process of becoming a real estate broker, a career change she said will “give her family more financial stability.” But she knows it’ll be a while until Saenz and her can rest their heads. “I’m from the Philippines and she’s from Mexico, so we know what intense poverty looks like,” Gonzales said. “I’m grateful for what we have, but I’m hoping it’s not this hard forever.” Carlos Ballesteros is a corps member of Report for America, a not-for-profit journalism program that aims to bolster Sun-Times coverage of Chicago’s South Side and West Side.","[0.5025299191474915, 0.49747011065483093]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5025299191474915
113,"Illinois Supreme Court Justice Robert Thomas gave Democrats on the high court a figurative kick in the rear end in 2016 after they ruled 4-3 that the Independent Map Amendment didn’t meet constitutional requirements..  Thomas, a placekicker for the Chicago Bears for 10 years, announced his retirement from the court Monday. In that 2016 dissent he wrote that the majority’s action should “include a bright orange warning sticker for readers to paste over” the citizen-initiative section of the Constitution that reads “Out of Service.” He also wrote that “the Illinois Constitution is meant to prevent tyranny, not to enshrine it.”.  That response endeared him to those of us who are tired of politicians picking their voters rather than the other way around. He was at least as frustrated as the more than 563,000 Illinoisans who signed petitions to put the Independent Map Amendment on the ballot..  It was the second time such a referendum was tossed from the ballot. In 2014, a lower court judge rejected a similar redistricting proposal..  The tyranny may feel as if it’s enshrined, but there still are vigorous efforts to change the way Illinois draws its political maps..  CHANGE Illinois is trying to persuade lawmakers to vote on the Fair Map Amendment, which would create an independent redistricting commission. The group hopes to secure support from enough legislators to put a referendum question on the November ballot. The deadline is May 3..  The Illinois Constitution requires that once every decade, after the decennial census, legislators get together to draw political boundaries that affect state House and Senate and U.S. House districts. The process has been required since the U.S. Supreme Court’s “one person, one vote” decision in 1964. In that landmark case, the court required that legislative districts represent equal numbers of people. Every decade, districts were to be redrawn based on the new census figures..  The process has been hijacked by partisan politics. It’s not just Illinois. Across the country, whichever political party is in charge in a state gets to draw the maps, and those politicians draw the maps to favor themselves and their friends..  Maps are drawn so that the party in power can have as many like-minded folks within the boundaries as possible, which creates easy wins for incumbents. That’s why they are successfully reelected 97% of the time. You didn’t think it was because they were doing such a good job, did you?.  Smart people realize that districts are so badly gerrymandered that it’s nearly impossible for a Republican to get elected in some districts or a Democrat in others. Good candidates are forced to the sidelines, which is why there are so many uncontested races year after year..  In Illinois, Democrats have controlled the process. In other states, Republicans are just as guilty. The 2011 map helped Illinois Democrats achieve veto-proof, three-fifths majorities in both the House and Senate in the 2012 elections..  Illinois has 118 state House districts and 59 Senate districts, and some of the boundaries of those districts are so warped that it appears the maps were drawn by someone who got a head start on the recreational use of marijuana..  There’s a lot of bipartisan support for Fair Maps. Republicans, obviously, would like to see the system change so there could be more of them going to Springfield, but even prominent Democrats see the value in creating a more fair method of drawing legislative districts. JB Pritzker pledged support for an independent redistricting commission during his campaign for governor..  However, Speaker of the House Mike Madigan has been opposed because the current system has helped make the Chicago Democrat the most powerful politician in the state. Lawyers friendly to the speaker helped kill the 2014 and 2016 measures. Madigan allowed the 2018 version of the Fair Map Amendment to die in House Rules Committee..  It comes down to this: Are you satisfied with the political makeup of Illinois? Most people who don’t have a seat in government will tell you that they are not..  The issue can no longer be kicked down the road. It’s time for Fair Maps..

Anchored by stores like Carson Pirie Scott and Montgomery Ward, it was the place to see and be seen..  That’s the Matteson Patricia Hill grew up admiring..  She was raised in Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood. And when she and her husband were raising their two daughters, they chose Matteson, buying a two-story home in a quiet residential neighborhood for $315,000 in 2003..  But things are different now. Visions of the community’s future no longer bring comfort. Instead, they inspire crippling fear..  “This is supposed to be the American Dream for me and my family … I’m holding on to everything I can, but I’m losing because of this house,” Patricia said..  “It’s a nightmare.”.  Patricia Hill Austin Berg | Illinois Policy Institute.  She believes her home is now worth $215,000. Her property tax bill is more than $10,000 a year. And she has twice been on the cusp of foreclosure..  “Everyone is in shock when I tell them the property taxes. They say it must be an error,” she said..  “It’s not. [This house] is all I have. It’s my net worth. It’s who I am. The stress, the sleepless nights. It never goes away. I just turned 66 yesterday and I can’t even think about retiring.”.  A new survey by WalletHub ranked Illinois property taxes as the second highest in the nation for the third year running. And data released in February from the Federal Housing Finance Agency show the average annual housing appreciation rate in Illinois since the end of 2007 has been a microscopic 0.2%, besting only New Jersey and Connecticut..  Illinoisans have seen their home values sputter or decline. But property tax bills have only been going up – fast..  Rev. Anton Seals is another South Side Chicago native who moved his family to Matteson to settle down. His home value has been virtually flat since he bought it 10 years ago for $280,000. The raw property tax bill on that home is $15,000, but a disability and senior exemption drops it to around $10,500 a year..  “Suppose your vision was to get out of the city, where there was a lot of gunshots and violence,” Anton said..  “We move to this quiet neighborhood where everything seemed to be going well. But over 10 years we’ve lost so much. You’ve worked this hard for this long, your taxes are going up and your property is being devalued.”.  Anton Seals Austin Berg | Illinois Policy Institute.  Patricia and Anton talked about the psychological distress of never feeling like their home is truly theirs. Compounding that uneasiness is an exodus of businesses from the area in recent years..  Lincoln Mall is now an empty lot. The village just competed the demolition of its last vestige. Meanwhile, new businesses require large tax breaks and subsidies to open their doors..  The same story is unfolding in communities across the state. Illinoisans know there’s a problem..  So state lawmakers in the spring created the 88-member Illinois Property Tax Relief Task Force. It was charged with finding solutions by the end of 2019. But no official report has been released to the public yet..  Seals, a community organizer by trade, has taken matters into his own hands..  Three years ago, he started putting out word to start a citizens’ group on the neighborhood messaging app Nextdoor. The Concerned Neighbors of Matteson, or CNOM, now meets every month at the Matteson Public Library. The nonpartisan group has three main goals: Tax relief, economic development and voter participation..  “This is a ministry mission for me,” Seals said. “I was critically ill and CNOM is what kept me going. It gave me something to fight for.”.  Anton Seals Austin Berg | Illinois Policy Institute.  Some claim a lack of school funding from the state is the cause of Illinois’ high property taxes. But that argument can sometimes ignore where leaders are wasting billions of existing education dollars. Chicago’s south suburbs point to the two real drivers of property tax hikes statewide: pensions and school district bureaucracy..  Illinois was the only state to spend over $1 billion on school district administration in 2017, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And it spends more on pensions as a share of state and local government spending than any other state , according to the Pew Charitable Trusts..  One infamous example played out in south suburban Calumet City, where superintendent Troy Paraday was making $430,000 a year to oversee 1,200 students. After being fired for financial misconduct, the 57-year-old Paraday collected nearly $220,000 in pension benefits in his first six months of retirement in 2019, according to the Daily Southtown..  Thankfully, there are solutions on the table in Springfield..  House Bill 4005 is a bipartisan proposal that would let local voters decide on school district consolidation (not school consolidation) after a statewide review process. HJRCA 38 is a constitutional amendment that would allow for modest pension reform, such as later retirement ages and smaller cost-of-living adjustments..  For communities like Matteson, time is of the essence. Patricia’s neighbors are simply walking away from their homes. That depreciates her home value while upping her tax bill..  “Walking away is quitting,” she said..  “I will not give up. We want to make a change. We have invested too much to leave this all behind.”.  Austin Berg is a Chicago-based writer with the Illinois Policy Institute who wrote this column for The Center Square.

By Associated Press , Wire Service Content March 5, 2020 By Associated Press , Wire Service Content March 5, 2020, at 2:19 p.m. More.  Belvidere, Ill. (AP) — The body of a woman whose identity was unknown for 20 years following her 1999 death has been moved from a cemetery in Wisconsin and reburied next to her family in Illinois ..  Peggy Lynn Johnson was known as “Jane Doe” until last November when investigators were able to identify her and arrested 64-year-old Linda La Roche in connection to Johnson's death..  Investigators said Johnson was 23 when she was killed. She had been badly beaten, burned and tortured, WDJT-TV reported. Her body was found in a Wisconsin cornfield..  “Many of the criminal investigators worked on this case tirelessly to find closure,” said Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling..  Johnson's burial was held Wednesday in Belvidere, Illinois. Relatives, community members and Racine County, Wisconsin, deputies came out to say their goodbyes..  “It does feel like a peaceful end,” Schmaling said. “I think the family has found some closure now that she's been identified and is in her final resting place never to be disturbed again.”.  Schmaling thanked the community for donations that allowed Johnson's body to be moved and a proper headstone..  Copyright 2020 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.

119,"Illinois officials annually ask credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service to look down the road and evaluate the state’s fortunes. The most recent report said that while the Land of Lincoln’s situation appears optimistic, the agency predicted a slowdown that the state's government isn't prepared to handle. The nonpartisan Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability-sponsored report “State of Illinois Forecast Report” by Moody’s Investors Service was released in late February and discussed this week in Springfield. The theme of the report was that Illinois has been in the “late-cycle expansion” phase of the economic cycle. “Weak demographic trends and deep-rooted fiscal problems such as mounting pension obligations and a shrinking tax base represent the biggest hurdles to the longer-term outlook,” the report said. “The forecast anticipates that the state will grow a step behind the Midwest average and a few steps behind the nation over the extended forecast horizon.” COGFA members met Wednesday to discuss the agency’s assessment of the state’s outlook. “Our state’s fiscal crisis impacts decisions by businesses on whether they want to relocate or stay in Illinois,” COGFA Chief Clayton Klenke said. “Manufacturing has been a bright spot but long-term trends forecast that it will be difficult to maintain the state’s manufacturing base. The college-age population in Illinois and the midwest is declining...Illinois has seen lower personal income growth than the nation. This has led to underperformance in areas such as retail and hospitality. Klenke went on to highlight Illinois’ five consecutive years of population losses. Broken down by industry, the Moody’s report showed growth in business and financial sectors centered mainly in Chicago while other parts of the state’s economic pie, such as manufacturing, would see tepid growth. “Illinois’ manufacturers will face daunting competition in the global marketplace in the long term. They have been forced to shift operations to lower-cost regions of the world to remain competitive, and although this trend has slowed as labor has become more expensive overseas, it does not reduce the cost advantage sufficiently to reverse this process,” it said. Manufacturing growth accounted for one of every four new jobs in Illinois over the last fiscal year. Members of the governor’s Department of Revenue touted Illinois’ gains in recent years at a House Revenue and Finance Committee hearing Thursday, stressing future growth will be small but still existent in the coming year. “While Illinois, by some measures, underperformed the U.S. by some measures during the current economic expansion, we appear to be benefiting here...from the tight labor market that we’re witnessing,” said Marty Johnson, chief economist with IDOR. Pritzker’s office is counting on a growing economy, proposing a $42 billion spending plan that projects $691 million in natural state income revenue growth from economic improvements compared to this year.

120,"Conservatives often like to cite “big government” and “high taxes” as reasons for everything wrong with the country and the state. Oversimplifying complex issues, they cherry pick data and reach conclusions not really supported by evidence..  Scott Reeder, for example, citing “hundreds of letters” and the complaints of a seatmate on a flight, blames exorbitant taxes for Illinois’ declining population. Although he admits that the majority of people leaving are from the middle class, he worries that “high earners” are leaving. However, Site Selections, a business publication, has named Chicago’s metro area the nationwide leader in economic investment for the seventh consecutive year, as more companies have moved into the region and created jobs..  A recent article in Chicago Magazine by Edward McClelland (Jan. 29, 2020) suggests that Illinois’ exodus is much more complicated than simply a question of taxes..  In what is often called the reverse Great Migration, Chicago, along with other large cities, is losing its black middle class. Using data that undercut Reeder’s statement that those making $200,000 or more are leaving, the article says, “A comparison of 2010 Census data with the 2013–2017 American Community Survey shows that Illinois’s white, Latino, and Asian populations all increased, while its black population declined from 1,866,414 to 1,833,501. According to the same data, Illinois saw a decline in households earning less than $100,000 a year, while those earning more than $200,000 increased by 50 percent. The state’s real per capita income is also on an upward trend, from $43,208 in 2010 to $53,727 in 2019.”.  So the number of those earning over $200,000 is actually increasing; either they are moving here or some households have increased their earnings..  There are other reasons for a declining population, usually ignored by those who have an anti-tax agenda. A 2018 policy paper by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning noted an aging population, declining birth rates and stagnant immigration. A Census Bureau survey cited a new job or a job transfer as the principal cause of leaving Illinois..  A long Chicago Tribune article by Cecilia Reyes and Patrick M. O’Connell (Sept. 25, 2019) points out that it’s only recently, in 2014, that Illinois’ population has declined, because usually people moving into the state made up for the people moving out..

The factors with the greatest statistical significance pertain to governance: Millennials are moving away from states that have more lawyers per capita (a proxy for regulatory burdens) and higher taxpayer burdens, both in terms of current taxation and expected future burdens based on indebtedness. They are moving to states with fewer rules and less-costly government. This result is consonant with common sense: People look for values in all areas of their lives.

126,"Commentary: Illinois’ exodus problem is a governance problem By Richard Porter Chicago Tribune | Aug 07, 2020 at 11:23 AM Illinois has been losing population. U.S. census data currently being collected nationally will show whether that trend continues. (Charlie Neibergall / AP) Illinois has a population problem: Our population has been shrinking faster than any other state (except one). The Chicago Tribune Editorial Board and others call this the Illinois Exodus . Population changes are a measure of governance quality. We are free to choose where to live, and the United States offers 50 states and thousands of different localities, each governed in different ways. People consider many factors when choosing where to live, and how a state is governed can be a significant factor. Over time, people migrate toward places that are governed well and away from areas that are governed poorly. Advertisement Illinois’ governance is rife with problems: Our state offers residents and potential residents a high tax burden, high government indebtedness, both in an absolute and a per capita basis, and high and growing crime rates in our major cities. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, from 1900 until 1970 when Illinois amended its constitution to authorize an income tax and to prohibit future reforms of public pensions, Illinois was among the fastest growing states in the country. Since then, Illinois’ population growth faded, and then Illinois started to shrink as its tax burden and indebtedness continued to grow. Advertisement Gov. J.B. Pritzker and House Speaker Michael Madigan are working together to amend the state constitution to increase the tax burden even further. Advocates for their tax proposal claim graduated tax rates are “modern” and people will stay and pay those rates. Really?

The resolution stood out as a first in the racially unsettled months since the killing of George Floyd and resonated because it happened in what was once a Confederate state. But while Asheville's resolution promises reparations, it does not say when or how they will be paid for. Another city has gone further down the road to reparations than any other and may be a model for the small but growing number of places considering making amends for past racial injustice, including Seattle; Providence, Rhode Island; and the state of California. MORE: Asheville city council approves reparations plan as Providence explores idea Last November, Evanston, Illinois, not only adopted a resolution for reparations as part of the city budget, it found an inventive source of funds: tax revenue from newly legalized marijuana sales. ""Evanston absolutely is the pioneer,"" said Nkechi Taifa, an attorney and member of the National African American Reparations Commission. ""It basically is the first municipality to commit public dollars to reparations."" PHOTO: Evanston Ald. Robin Rue Simmons, 5th Ward, proposed a reparations fund that Evanston City Council approved at their meeting on Nov. 25, 2019. (Chicago Tribune/TNS via Getty Images) More The plan calls for using $10 million collected by the city in cannabis sales taxes over an estimated 10 years to provide African American residents with housing assistance and economic development benefits. As of the 2010 Census, the Black population of Evanston was about 13,400 people. According to Alderman Robin Rue Simmons, who has led the effort, details for the first ""remedy policy"" are nearing completion: a $25,000 direct benefit payment to purchase a home. Those who qualify for such a check, according to the current proposal, are Black residents who lived in Evanston between 1919 and 1969 or their direct descendants. ""We are going to lead with housing,"" said Simmons, because homeownership is considered a ""benefit that would build wealth,"" putting Black residents on the path toward bridging the ""wealth gap."" MORE: Marijuana sales in Illinois top $3M on first day of legal recreational cannabis in the state The next round of benefits from the fund will be designed to encourage business development and entrepreneurship. When Illinois readied to legalize marijuana sales last year, Simmons and others on the city council thought ""there is no more appropriate place to use the sales tax from that industry."" Over 70% of Evanston's marijuana-related arrests were among African Americans, even though they are less than 17% of the population, according to Simmons. ""If there is going to be some benefit to the community from legalizing marijuana, then it certainly should be targeted to the Black community most damaged by this overpolicing,"" Simmons said. PHOTO: In this Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2020, photo, cannabis is grown at Revolution Global's cannabis cultivation center in Delavan, Ill. (Charles Rex Arbogast/AP Photo) More So the council acted quickly, approving the reparations fund in an 8-to-1 vote. ""We did not want the cannabis sales tax folded into our general fund and be spent in some way. Then we'd have to take it away from something,"" Alderman Melissa Wynne recalled. ""We realized before a penny of this arrives in our coffers, we have to decide right now, 'We're putting this in a fund.'"" Taifa said that since marijuana has been central to ""a criminal punishment system that disproportionately sent Blacks to prison,"" it is ""poetic justice"" that cannabis serve as ""the same entity that is seeking to close the Black-white wealth gap."" Evanston could ""provide a blueprint for the rest of the country,"" Taifa said. ","[0.5017739534378052, 0.4982260465621948]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5017739534378052
129,"'Donald trump on DaTechGuy's reporting ""…It's nonsense nobody reports that, but you do that's why I like you"" Feds strike at Democratic corruption in Illinois on two fronts.  By John Ruberry.  As WIND-AM radio host Dan Proft says, “Illinois isn’t broken, it’s fixed.”.  And the biggest fixer of all in Illinois is Boss Michael Madigan, the chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party since 1997, speaker of the Illinois House, except for two years, since 1983, and Democratic committeman of the 13th Ward since 1969..  As I’ve mentioned many times before in this space, Madigan, among many other things, is a walking advertisement for term limits. I didn’t call him a walking-and-talking advertisement for term limits, because Illinois’ most powerful politician infrequently speaks to the media..  On Friday Boss Madigan was implicated in a bribery scheme involving Illinois’ largest utility, Commonwealth Edison, part of the Exelon Corporation. ComEd, in a deferred prosecution agreement, is charged with one count of bribery. ComEd, according to the filing, admitted that it gained $150 million in rate structuring over the last eight years. Which means that Illinoisans like me have to pay more for electricity..  ComEd has to pay a $200 million fine. If the utility behaves over the next three years the bribery charge will be dropped..  The bribe scheme involves the utility rewarding contracts and jobs–some of them allegedly little-or-no-work—to Madigan cronies. Madigan is not named by the feds but he is widely believed to be the person labeled Public Official A in their paperwork..  Illinois’ weaselly Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, the state’s second-most powerful pol, had this to say later on Friday about the man whose political machine arguably gained him the Democratic nomination in 2018, and hence the governor’s office in the general election, “If these allegations of wrongdoing by the speaker are true, there is no question that he will have betrayed the public trust and he must resign therefore.”.  But Pritzker has his own legal problem. The aggressive U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, John Lausch, in an investigation involving the former Cook County assessor, Joseph Berrios, is believed to be looking at Pritzker. Berrios is the former chairman of the Cook County Regular Democratic Organization, better known as the Chicago Machine. Berrios has long ties to Madigan and it’s generally believed that Madigan was the impetus for Berrios’ unanimous election as chairman of the Cook County Dems in 2007..  A billionaire, Pritzker and his wife, MK, had the toilets removed from a Chicago Gold Coast mansion that he owns and that is adjacent to the one he lives in. Allegedly the commodes were removed so JB’s residence could receive a $330,000 property tax break because the mansion next door was “uninhabitable.” Also on Friday, news broke about the investigation of the Cook County assessor’s office involving other 100 properties. Many of the tax appeals filed were handled by a small law firm where Boss Madigan is a name partner. A law firm where Chicago alderman Ed Burke is a partner–he is under indictment for racketeering–handled some of the other appeals..  The Pritzkers later paid the county back the $330,000 he saved. JB and MK deny any wrongdoing. However, the Cook County inspector general called the toilet removal appeal a “scheme to defraud” taxpayers such as myself..  Back to Madigan ..  The jobs Madigan allegedly pressured ComEd to hand out allegedly include a real plum, a board of directors seat at ComEd. That person, not named by the feds, got the seat but he is no longer on the board. Some students who live in Madigan’s Chicago ward received internships from ComEd . While internships may not involve a paycheck, job offers can follow. Madigan’s office even directed the utility to hire meter readers for ComEd..  According to someone prosecutors named Individual A, “ We hire these guys because [Madigan] came to us. It’s just that simple.”.  Boss Madigan is widely considered to the man behind the fiscal crisis that has destroyed Illinois. The Prairie State is burdened unsustainable public-worker pension debt. Public-sector unions have been a loyal cog for Democrats in Illinois for decades. Madigan’s fingerprints are on every Illinois budget since the early 1980s. Yet Madigan somehow finds the time to tell which meter readers ComEd should hire..  Illinois has $4.8 billion in unpaid bills , the lowest amount since 2015. But a $1.2 billion federal loan designed for COVID-19 relief deserved the credit. Loans, by the way, are supposed to be paid back..  Illinois has been annually losing population since 2014..  As for alleged Madigan strong-arming, the feds aren’t just looking at Commonwealth Edison. Madigan’s state office was subpoenaed on Friday, allegedly authorities were seeking records involving AT&T (disclosure, I worked for them for 11 years), Walgreens, Rush University–and a whole lot more..  Through a spokesperson Madigan denies any wrongdoing..  While Donald Trump’s chances of winning Illinois this fall are miniscule–part of that reason is the Illinois conservatives are demoralized because of Madigan’s obscene gerrymandering of state legislative and congressional districts –reelecting Trump may be the best way to ensure a thorough prosecution of Democratic corruption in Illinois. Americans, we’re all in the same boat. A Joe Biden pick for the Chicago area’s chief federal prosecutor might be less enthusiastic about going after Madigan and the Illinois culture of corruption..

130,"Politics Let’s finally put Chicago — not self-serving aldermen — first in redrawing the city’s wards Going back to Chicago’s earliest days, redrawing the city’s ward map has been an insiders’ game. That has to end. Oct 13, 2020, 6:35pm CDT Share this story If done the right way, the upcoming remap of Chicago’s wards could change the city council for the better. With all the talk these days about what’s needed to build a more equitable Chicago, here's a reform that can’t be left off the list: A fair and proper remap of the city’s 50 wards. The City Council is legally required to come up with a remap ordinance by December 2021. An equitable ward remap would help assure that all corners of Chicago are equally heard and represented in City Hall. Editorials The decennial remapping process, unfortunately, is handled by aldermen and political powerhouses who historically have redrawn war boundaries to protect their seats and punish their political enemies, rather than look out for the rest of us. Going back to Chicago’s earliest days, drawing the city’s ward map has been a game of insider deal-making, rather than an exercise in creating a more responsive and democratic City Council for all. But with many of the old guard aldermen who for many years held sway over the mapping process now either retired (such as former Ald. Richard Mell), or politically sidelined (paging Ald. Edward Burke), the city stands its best chance in generations to draw a fair, sensible and inclusive ward map. The time has come to fix this once and for all. Ending gerrymandering ‘critical’ An example of how the city’s wards are badly drawn: The reasonably compact Englewood neighborhood has a population of fewer than 15,000 people across just 3 square miles. But that single neighborhood is carved up among six different wards. In fact, a mile-and-half drive straight down 63rd Street from Halsted Street to Damen Avenue will take you from the 20th Ward through the 16th and 15th — and back to 16th again. One the other hand, there’s the 2nd Ward, which bobs and weaves across seven North Side neighborhoods from Streeterville to Bucktown. All of this leaves many residents wondering what ward in which they live, and who represents them in the City Council. In some wards, those remote, politically tacked-on areas also receive less attention from their alderman — and can’t do much to vote the alderman out. “Chicago stands at a precipice right now as we seek to fix the systemic racism that has left people out and held our city back,” said Madeleine Doubek, executive director of CHANGE Illinois , a non-partisan group that advocates for the reform of elections and government. “Ending ward gerrymandering and giving residents their power and voices is critical to this process. We need a map that puts the people first,” she said. An independent commission? Fixing this mess will be a big challenge and require a thoughtful approach, particularly this go-round. For instance, how will the remap process address the ongoing historic population loss of more than 200,000 residents from Black neighborhoods on the South and West sides? Or that there are no aldermen of Asian heritage despite the distinct and growing presence of Asian Americans in at least two areas: Chinatown/Bridgeport on the Near South Side and the West Argyle Street community on the North Side. Mayor Lori Lightfoot last year supported forming an independent citizens’ commission to remap ward boundaries. “I live in the 35th Ward, and the ward has no relationship to neighborhood boundaries,” Lightfoot said in a WTTW interview then. “We can’t afford to keep carving up communities that isn’t fair to them or doesn’t give them fair representation.” We’d like to see more about how the commission would work — and, most importantly, who would be on it — before taking sides on that idea. The devil, just as in when drawing ward boundaries, is in the details. But we’re firmly behind the spirit of the idea, which is that there has to be a better way to redraw ward boundaries every 10 years than to leave the job solely in the hands of those — aldermen with turf to protect — who got us in this mess in the first place.

131,"Elvia Malagón and Brett Chase Ashlee Rezin Garcia/Sun-Times Two veteran journalists are joining the Chicago Sun-Times to bring readers much-needed coverage of social justice, income inequality, the environment and public health issues through a grant from The Chicago Community Trust. Elvia Malagón, who most recently worked for the Chicago Tribune, and Brett Chase, who most recently was an investigative reporter for the Better Government Association, will join the newspaper’s staff within the next week. “Brett and Elvia are exactly the kind of journalists we envisioned taking on these roles when we began discussing the idea of these grant-funded positions with the Community Trust last year,” Sun-Times Executive Editor Chris Fusco said. “As our region emerges from the coronavirus pandemic, it will be more important than ever for our newspaper to continue shining a light on economic and health inequities, keep watch over education and immigration policies, and make sure our elected leaders are doing everything they can to safeguard the environment and stop widespread flooding.” “A core component of our strategy to close the racial and ethnic wealth gap in this region is ensuring those who are most affected are at the table to inform proposed solutions. To do that, they need objective facts about what is happening in our communities,” said Helene Gayle, president and CEO of The Chicago Community Trust. “These two reporter positions at the Sun-Times will cover issues that are particularly important in Black, Latinx and underinvested areas.” The Community Trust funding is the latest in a series of grants to the Sun-Times newsroom. Report for America is partially funding two newsroom positions — a reporter and photographer to cover the South and West sides — and AARP Chicago is underwriting La Voz Chicago, the Sun-Times’ Spanish-language news website that launched May 10. Chase and Malagón’s work frequently will appear on the La Voz homepage: suntimes.com/la-voz . “With these funds, we are able to stay true to our mission, which includes educating the electorate and giving voters the freedom to make informed decisions about their communities,” Sun-Times CEO Nykia Wright said. “We’re grateful for the support of the Community Trust and other organizations as we move closer to our goal of making the Sun-Times a self-sustaining news organization.” As is the case with AARP Chicago and La Voz, the Community Trust will not supervise Chase or Malagón nor have a say in their coverage. Stories by Chase and Malagón will be available for free online. Each story will note at the end that their work “is made possible by a grant from the Chicago Community Trust.” Malagón and Chase also will participate in community forums in which they’ll directly interact with readers on the subjects they cover. The grant will have two, one-year renewal options, after which time the Sun-Times will fully fund the positions. Chase most recently covered environmental protection, pollution and public health for the BGA. He has been honored nationally by the National Press Foundation and the Society of Environmental Journalists. In his six-plus years at the BGA, he also produced award-winning reports about public housing and covered transportation, health care and energy. Chase is a former reporter and editor at Bloomberg News, worked as an editor at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and as a reporter and editor at Crain’s Chicago Business. He has a journalism degree from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, and has taught journalism at Loyola University in Chicago. In nearly four years at the Tribune, Malagón became passionate about producing compelling stories about immigration, the 2020 Census, crime and other issues impacting marginalized communities. She won a Tribune outstanding professional performance award last year and a Tribune Edward Scott Beck Award for domestic reporting in 2016. Malagón previously covered criminal courts for The Times of Northwest Indiana and got her start in journalism at The Ledger in Lakeland, Fla. A native of East Chicago, Indiana, she is a graduate of Indiana University’s journalism school. Her work also has been honored by the Hoosier State Press Association and the Chicago Headline Club. The Chicago Community Trust is a community foundation dedicated to strengthening the Chicago region and improving the lives of the people who call it home. The Trust, which is more than 100 years old, administers more than $360 million in annual grants as part of its commitment to equity, opportunity and prosperity for the Chicago region.

133,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Drowned out by the coronavirus and national politics, Republican and Democratic operatives are quietly preparing for a battle of state legislative supremacy later this year that could have a profound effect on political power for the next decade..  The November ballot will feature more than 5,000 elections for state House and Senate members in 35 states who will play a significant role in crafting or passing new voting districts for Congress and state legislative chambers based on census results..  Republicans, who currently control a majority of state legislative chambers, generally will be on defense against a well-funded Democratic effort. But Republicans are trying to change that narrative. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT.  The national Republican State Leadership Committee on Tuesday rolled out a target list focused on a dozen states where it hopes to strengthen Republican redistricting power or dent that of Democrats. The targets include 115 state legislative seats held by Democrats in districts won by Republican President Donald Trump in 2016..  ""The best way for us to play defense is to go on offense and flip these seats,"" said Austin Chambers, president of the GOP legislative organization..  Trump could be a big factor in the down-ballot races. National surveys of voters from 2006-2018 have shown that presidential approval carries nearly three times as much impact in determining voters' choices for state legislative candidates as their approval of the legislature itself, said Steven Rogers, a political scientist at Saint Louis University who studies elections with a focus on state legislatures..  That's likely to remain the case this year, Rogers said, though there's a chance that voters could be more attuned to state elections because of the attention given to governors who have been leading their states' coronavirus response..  National Democratic groups have compiled similar target lists focused on Republican-held seats, with a goal of flipping control of several closely divided chambers to their favor. Democrats are focusing not only on districts that Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 presidential election, but also on some Trump-won districts where they think likely Democratic nominee Joe Biden may fare better..  ""After the coronavirus and with Biden at the top of the ticket, our map now expands back out to districts that had Democratic DNA, that have voters that thought Trump might turn around the economy in working-class Rust Belt towns across the Midwest,"" said Jessica Post, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee..  In 2010, the first midterm election of Democrat Barack Obama's presidency, Republicans scored big victories in state legislatures across the country as the Republican State Leadership Committee outspent its Democratic rival by a 3-to-1 ratio. The next year, Republicans used their enhanced power in some states to draw voting districts that have benefited their legislative and congressional candidates for much of the past decade..  ""Democrats have been paying the price since 2010 for their lack of success that year,"" Rogers said..  Democrats have since ratcheted up their state legislative efforts. Obama and his former attorney general, Eric Holder, have spearheaded a new Democratic group focused solely on state redistricting. Various Democratic-aligned interest groups also have begun pouring money into state legislative contests..  Democrats and Republicans have set their sights on some of the same places..  Republican-led legislatures in Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin appear on both of their redistricting target lists. So does Minnesota, the only state where Republicans control one legislative chamber and Democrats the other..  Some North Carolina state legislative candidates are running in newly redrawn districts this year after a state court tossed out the old ones drawn by the GOP-led Legislature as illegal partisan gerrymanders. But Democrats could face an uphill climb in states such as Texas and Wisconsin, where they will be running in the same districts that have favored Republicans..  Nationwide, 2020 may be ""a more pro-Democratic year, but the payoff in redistricting may be a little bit less, just due to what they can probably actually pick up,"" Rogers said..  Texas looms especially large because Democrats have made gains in recent legislative elections. Continued Republican control of both chambers and the governor's office would give the GOP great sway in shaping a large number of congressional districts..  Texas ranks second to California with 36 U.S. House seats and is likely to gain more following the census because of its population growth. Democrats hold full control in California, but an independent citizens commission is responsible for redistricting..  Some of the most hotly contested legislative elections are likely to occur in the Dallas and Houston suburbs..  ""It would be a huge blow for the Republican Party if we lost Texas,"" Chambers said. ""We're going to make sure that never happens."".  North Carolina is another big target. It's expected to be a battleground for president, U.S. Senate, U.S. House and the governorship. The state legislative elections also matter more than in most states, because the North Carolina governor has no veto power over the voting districts that lawmakers will draw. Republicans currently hold modest majorities in both the state House and Senate..  Kansas may appear to be one of the most surprising states on the target lists because of its solidly Republican legislative majorities. But Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly will have veto power over any redistricting plans passed by the Legislature. The battle focuses on whether Republicans will have the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.

An additional 2,128 new cases of the respiratory disease were diagnosed as well, which means 238,643 people have been infected in Illinois since the outbreak began. Thirteen of the deaths were in Chicago and the collar counties, and 14 were downstate..   With the new infections, the state's seven-day rate of positive test results stands at 4.5%, the highest level since early June. However, Illinois Department of Public Health officials acknowledged problems collecting some test data over the past few days, which has affected the number of test results the state agency is reporting..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker, in a news conference, raised concern that the Labor Day holiday weekend creates an opportunity for infection rates to spike..  ""You're going to let your guard down because you'll be gathering with people you know, but that's exactly where spread is occurring,"" he warned. ""The reality is you don't know where everybody who's there has been, and unless you maintain social distance and are mindful about wearing masks, there can be -- and has been -- a significant amount of spread."".  Pritzker noted nine of the state's 11 regions have seen increases in the average infection rates over the past week, including four regions where the increase amounted to more than one full percentage point..  Two regions -- the Metro East region near St. Louis and the region containing Will and Kankakee counties -- are under ""enhanced mitigation efforts"" intended to help lower infection rates there that exceed 8%.

137,"Commentary: The path to Illinois pension reform By Mark Glennon Chicago Tribune | Sep 01, 2020 at 3:48 PM The rotunda in the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield on May 20, 2020. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune) In the catalog of malfeasance committed by Illinois politicians that brought the state to the brink of ruin, refusal to consider pension reform is at the top. “Politically impossible,” they say, as if that’s not self-fulfilling. “Legally impossible,” they say too. But it’s not. Advertisement There is a path to pension reform. It is ignored only because Illinoisans allow politicians to ignore it. Unless that changes now, Illinois’ financial crisis will become nothing short of calamity. Illinois is on life support. Even before the pandemic, Illinois’ pension burden was insurmountable without reform. Most municipalities were in equally bad shape. Now the pandemic is blowing massively larger holes in state and local budgets, and our shrinking population is pushing pension and tax burdens onto an ever-smaller number of people. Advertisement The total unfunded liability for state and local pensions has now reached an unimaginable $420 billion , according to Moody’s Investors Service, which provides far more realistic numbers than governments. That’s for work already performed and, for a little perspective, that’s about 10 times the annual state budget. That includes pensioner health care liabilities, which are entirely unfunded, but protected by the state constitution just like pensions. Illinois is an extreme outlier on pensions. Our state pension shortfall is the largest in the nation, according to Moody’s, and many of our municipal pensions are in still worse shape, especially Chicago’s. For Chicagoans, combined, overlapping, unfunded pension liabilities per household have reached an absurd $135,000. The state and most municipalities, including Chicago, are unable to fund pensions even at “tread-water” levels. That means total contributions to the pensions aren’t enough to keep them from plunging further into debt. But underfunding isn’t the problem. Lawmakers spent decades over promising pension benefits, which have overwhelmed the economy and taxpayers. Since 1987, accrued liabilities for the five state-run pensions have grown an obscene rate of 8.5% per year. Illinois courts have interpreted the state’s constitutional pension protection clause strictly, barring all meaningful reform. But there is a path to reform, and it’s one that does not require bankruptcy, which is the only other way to override the pension protection clause: Amend the state constitution’s pension protection clause and then enact the statutory reforms Illinois needs.

See all newsletters. Wirepoints, a local, nonprofit research organization, will be releasing a multipart series on the path to pension reform that can be found at wirepoints.org/pensionsolutions/ and parts of which will appear in the Tribune’s opinion section. Much of the state has been misled into thinking that this approach to reform, which would include amending the constitution, would still fail because the federal constitution bans the impairment of contracts. That’s simply untrue under federal law, provided the reforms are fair and reasonably necessary under the circumstances. The collapse in revenues resulting from the pandemic helps seal the case for reasonable reforms.

138,"URBANA, Ill. — Bird biodiversity is rapidly declining in the United States. The overall bird population decreased by 29% since 1970, while grassland birds declined by an alarming 53%..  Valuable for so much more than flight and song, birds hold a key place in ecosystems worldwide. When bird numbers and varieties dwindle, pest populations increase and much-needed pollination decreases. Those examples alone negatively impact food production and human health..  Likely reasons for the far-reaching and devastating declines include intensified agricultural production, use of pesticides, conversion of grassland to agricultural land, and climate change..  A new study from University of Illinois points to increased use of neonicotinoid insecticides as a major factor in the decline, said Madhu Khanna, distinguished professor in agricultural and consumer economics at U of I and co-author on the paper, published in Nature Sustainability..  Khanna said numerous studies have shown neonicotinoids — nicotine-based pesticides — negatively affect wild bees, honey bees and butterflies, but large-scale studies on the pesticide’s impact on birds have been limited. She speaks more about the topic in a podcast from the Center for the Economics of Sustainability at Illinois..  “This represents the first study at a national scale, over a seven-year time period, using data from hundreds of bird species in four different categories — grassland birds, non-grassland birds, insectivores and non-insectivores,” she said..  “We found robust evidence of the negative impact of neonicotinoids, in particular on grassland birds, and to some extent on insectivore birds after controlling for the effects of changes in land use.”.  Khanna and co-authors Yijia Li, a graduate student at U of I, and Ruiqing Miao, assistant professor at Auburn University, analyzed bird populations from 2008 to 2014 in relation to changes in pesticide use and agricultural crop acreage..  The authors found that an increase of 100 kilograms in neonicotinoid usage per county — a 12% increase on average — contributed to a 2.2% decline in populations of grassland birds and 1.6% in insectivorous birds..  By comparison, the use of 100 kilograms of non-neonicotinoid pesticides was associated with a 0.05% decrease in grassland birds and a 0.03% decline in non-grassland birds, insectivorous birds and non-insectivorous birds..  Since impacts accumulate, the authors estimate that, for example, 100 kilograms neonicotinoid use per county in 2008 reduced cumulative grassland-bird populations by 9.7% by 2014..  These findings suggest that neonicotinoid use has a relatively large effect on population declines of important birds and that these impacts grow over time..  According to the study, the adverse impacts on bird populations were concentrated in the Midwest, Southern California and Northern Great Plains..  The researchers say the effect of neonicotinoids could result directly from birds consuming treated crop seeds and indirectly by affecting the insect populations they feed on. Consumption of just a few seeds is enough to cause long-term damage to the birds’ reproduction and development..  The study included data on bird population and species diversity from the North American breeding bird survey, a comprehensive database with data from about 3,000 bird routes across the United States. The researchers correlated the bird data with pesticide use, as well as satellite data on agricultural crop acreage and urban land use..  They examined whether intensified agricultural production and conversion of grassland to agricultural land also contributed to the bird decline. Results showed a small negative effect on grassland birds related to cropland expansion, but no significant effect on other types of birds..  While the use of other pesticides has been flat or declining, neonicotinoid usage has grown exponentially over the past two decades. Neonicotinoids are considerably more toxic to insects and persist longer in the environment, the researchers note..  “This research provides compelling support for the re-evaluation of policies permitting the use of neonicotinoids by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by incorporating considerations of the implications of these pesticides for bird habitats,” the authors conclude.

139,"The following states are losing population -- New York, Illinois, West Virginia, Louisiana, Connecticut, Mississippi, Hawaii, New Jersey, Alaska, and Vermont..  Of all those states, the one that catches my eye would be Illinois , the state that has lost more people than any other state in the United States since 2010..  In 2014, Chicago had 2.727 million. In 2019, it was around 2.705 million. So a drop of 22,000..  In 2014, Chicago's metro area had 9,564,614 people. In 2019, it was around 9,472,676. Drop of around 92,938..  In 2014, Illinois had 12,890,000. In 2019, it's around 12,659,682. Drop of around 230, 318..  As we know, the reason Illinois is a Democrat state is that Chicago votes overwhelming Democrat, offsetting the Republican votes in the other counties. Would Chicago's population loss support the possibility that the state could trend purple in 2028, 2032, or 2036?.  I'll address some counter-arguments:.  1). The rest of the state outside Chicago has lost population too, so whatever votes the Democrats lose in Chicago might be negated by the whatever votes the Republicans lose outside Chicago?.  But most of the population loss is coming from migration out, not deaths. And people who move do tend to be younger and more liberal, no? So it's possible that the Republican voters stayed while the Democrat voters left..  Indeed, a lot of the population decline in Chicago is coming from the departure of African-Americans. In 2010, there were 872,286 blacks in Chicago. In 2017, there was around 797,253.

In addition, not all purple states display it's purple-ness in a smaller margin of victory. West Virginia in 1996 was considered a Democrat stronghold, voting Democrat by about 15%.

141,"Cook County Jail Reports Additional Positive Coronavirus Tests In a televised coronavirus address to the city of Chicago on Thursday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot talked about the city’s response to COVID-19, including extending the closure of Chicago Public Schools..  ""We have to push back the census,"" Lightfoot said, according to the Sun-Times. ""There's not enough bandwidth to do both particularly when what we’re talking about is going door-to-door, educating people. The libraries now are closed. So that avenue for filling out the digital applications isn’t available.”.  The census, held every ten years, is currently underway. Local, regional and federal agencies have been preparing for months to ensure an accurate and robust count..  The census - mandated by the U.S. Constitution - determines representation in Congress, compiles critical data used by the public and private sector and helps apportion $675 billion in federal funding..  The coronavirus has brought normal life to a standstill for millions of people, including some members of the Census Bureau. Last week, the bureau announced it would delay field operations for two weeks due to concerns over the virus. Advocates worry delayed state funding could hurt Illinois’ showing in the 10-year count, which determines how many U.S. House seats each state gets and how to distribute billions of federal dollars to local communities..  Field operations are crucial to education and participation. Workers going door-to-door are especially important for those who don't have internet access, or for people who may not be inclined to participate..  After much debate and controversy, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked President Donald Trump's administration from adding a question on U.S. citizenship to the census, with critics of the move saying it would deter participation..  As of Tuesday, census data showed 17.7% of Chicagoans and 23.8% of Illinoisans had already filled out the 2020 census, which is available online , by phone or by mail.

So far, three detainees have died of COVID-19, while another 144 have recovered from the disease..  “Despite unprecedented challenges our correctional staff face managing the jail during a pandemic, the inherit risks and threats they face day in and day out continue,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement..  As of Tuesday, 83% of detainees at the jail were being held for violent crimes, the sheriff’s office said..  The jail population dropped nearly 25% — to 4,348 — after Chief Criminal Court Judge LeRoy K. Martin Jr. mandated a sweeping review of criminal cases of hundreds of low-risk, mostly non-violent detainees..  In February, a detainee in the jail allegedly beat his cellmate to death with soap in a sock.","[0.5761749148368835, 0.42382505536079407]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5761749148368835
146,"Women's March Chicago honors the disabled, highlights key issues by Carrie Maxwell, Windy City Times 2020-01-19 Women's March Chicago ( WMC ) kicked off its fourth large-scale march on a wintry Jan. 18 morning in Grant Park..  The marchwith more than 50,000 participantshonored people with disabilities and celebrated the historic number of women elected to city, county, state and national office across Illinois over the past two years..  Representing the many women officials across Illinois were Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, U.S. Robin Kelly and Jan Schakowsky, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller, Illinois state Comptroller Susana Mendoza, Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin, Chicago City Clerk Anna Valencia and Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner Debra Shore. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin was also a march leader..  The march featured volunteer Wayfinders who assisted people with disabilities as they made their way from Grant Park to Federal Plaza in the Loop. The elected officials served as honorary Wayfinders..  Just before the march stepped off, Lightfoot said, ""When people say stupid things that demonize our [LGBTQ] community I am going to speak up every time. This is broader than what happened this week at city council. We have an obligation as leaders to make sure that we are speaking up, expressing our values and having an unambiguous voice about the things that matter to our communities. I am going to continue doing that."".  On Jan. 15, Lightfoot criticized aldermen for objecting to a plan to determine if the LGBT community faces obstacles in obtaining city contractswith a few aldermen using language that some considered borderline homophobic. For example, Ald. Walter Burnett ( 27th Ward ) said, adding that while transgender business owners likely face discrimination, ""white gay males, I don't think they're discriminated against,"" CBS Chicago reported..  ""WMC exists to empower womyn across this city, state and country to use their voice towards the issues that matter most to them,"" said WMC board member Graciela Guzman. ""For us, that means marginalized voices are at the center of our movement: they lead our issue work and tell us what their communities need to feel safe, included and welcomed at the march. Our partners challenge us as a board and community to be transformational in our solidarity: do something and that means not just attending the march..  ""We have become strengthened from our coalition building with communities of color, the disability community and the LGBTQ+ community. These are communities that have been disproportionately under attack during this administration and our job is to lift up their voices, causes and solutions to make our communities and country better every day. We all gain so much from not just lifting up their voices but the invaluable expertise they have as some of this country's greatest champions for justice."".  Along the march were signs and supporters highlighting the issues WMC and coalition partners chose to focus on this yearthe 2020 Census, climate justice, gun violence prevention, healthcare access and voting. GBTQ and HIV/AIDS organizations were among the many entities listed as coalition partners on the WMC website..  WMC Board President Jaquie Algee told this publication, ""Our goal today was for marchers to leave with a 2020 vision of what they marched for and how they can be actively involved in those issues and others throughout this year to support the 'must get right priorities' for them, their families and community."".

The theme repeated over and over by marchers and speakers was the needed ousting of not only President Donald Trump, but Vice-President Mike Pence in 2020..  Signs featured on local television news called for reproductive rights, human rights, LGBT rights and union rights. They also called for Medicare for All and full 2020 Census participation..

148,"On Thursday, January 16, 2020, the Chicago Urban League Partnership hosted a Census 2020 meeting. The Chicago Urban League (CUL) has actively pursued a comprehensive and accurate account of African-American communities in census data over the past two years. According to the CUL, the undercounting of African-American and other hard to count populations is profoundly concerning and needs to depend on the support from a broad range of stakeholders..  The purpose of the meeting was to provide background information on what is at risk for Illinois residents if an inaccurate count of the African-American community occurs. In attendance were faith leaders and social workers from communities around the Chicagoland area. The Chicago Urban League hopes the forum will help to initiate a collaboration amongst faith leaders, social workers, and the 2020 Census team..  Some of the objectives of the Chicago Urban League are to create compelling reasons to respond to the message shared with communities by developing an outreach plan that is as nimble as the population served, meanwhile dispelling misconceptions about the census and conveying an authentic sense of respect..  Kareem Butler, Project/Policy Coordinator at The Chicago Urban League, says, “Within Cook County, only 71 percent of households self-responded to the 2010 census. In Chicago, the self-response rate was 66 percent.” According to CUL, Chicago ranks number two among Top 10 cities with the highest number and percent of African-Americans, by hard to count (HTC) tract. Chicago is also number two, with 55.0% ranking in HTC for children under the age of five. Stephanie Bechteler, Executive Director of Research and Policy at The Chicago Urban League, says, “Often adults fail to count children in the home if they are not their biological children.”.  Butler and Bechteler agree that the significant reluctance for individuals not completing census forms is distrust. Among HTC communities, there is apprehension regarding the use of census data. A fear or skepticism is that census data will be shared with employers, landlords, and other government agencies. Communities with higher levels of contact with the criminal justice system are also more hesitant to complete census forms..  A general concern for the privacy of sensitive personal information is an issue with many communities unfamiliar with the legal protection of data. Communities are concerned about the type of information collected in questionnaires such as addresses, dates of births, and social security numbers..  According to Title 13 of the United States Code, the Census Bureau cannot release any identifiable information about you, your home, or your business, even to law enforcement agencies. The law ensures that your private data is protected and that your answers cannot be used against you by any government agency or court. The answers provided are only used to produce statistics..  Butler stressed the importance of completing the census by stating what is at stake for the state of Illinois, “It can be the loss of at least one congressional seat and about 1.2 Billion in federal funding over ten years.”.  Completion of census forms will begin on March 12, 2020. Forms can be completed on-line, by phone, or by mail..

149,"Pritzker announces expansion of free tuition program for University of Illinois schools Posted on January 20, 2020 A U of I spokesperson didn’t respond to questions about how much the expansion would cost. (Photo courtesy: Flickr).  By Illinois Radio Network.  SPRINGFIELD – More than half of Illinois’ households would qualify to be able to send a student to the University of Illinois with tuition paid for by taxpayers this fall after changes made at the request of the governor. The University of Illinois will expand its tuition assistance program to cover half of the households in the state, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. The announcement came one day after the state’s flagship university’s board of trustees approved increasing tuition costs for incoming freshmen for the first time in six years and approved a 40 percent pay raise for University of Illinois President Tim Killeen. “A central priority for me in this office is making college more affordable for those who can least afford it,” Pritzker said Friday in Chicago. “The University of Illinois’ trustees have agreed to my request that they expand free tuition to families who can least afford the costs of college.” He said students should be able to access the expanded program in time for the fall 2020 semester. The Illinois Commitment program offers enrollment tuition-free to in-state residents whose household income is below $61,000 annually. A ten percent increase, as Pritzker said, would increase that threshold to $67,100. Tuition is just part of the cost of attending college. The cost of housing, books and fees that students paid last fall totaled $31,390. Much of that would not be covered by the program. The median Illinois household income was $63,575 annually between 2014 and 2018, according to the U.S. Census. Representatives for the university didn’t immediately respond to questions about how much the program expansion would cost. The university’s board on Thursday approved raising the price of tuition by 1.8 percent at its Urbana-Champaign and Chicago campuses and 1 percent at its Springfield campus. The increase would only affect incoming freshmen. The college’s Urbana-Champaign campus will cost $12,254 for freshmen attending in the fall of 2020. Many of the university’s students already receive some sort of financial aid. Students whose households own more than $50,000 in assets don’t qualify to participate in the program. Illinois lawmakers have for years been pushing to implement a statewide “college promise” program that would guarantee the first two years at a community college or comparably-priced school are tuition and fee-free to in-state residents.

150,"Madigan celebrates 35th anniversary as Illinois House speaker Austin Berg | The Center Square Jan 20, 2020 5 hrs ago.  “Michael Madigan: Elected without fuss.”.  So reads one Illinois newspaper caption from Jan. 13, 1983, the day after Madigan’s peers in the General Assembly elected him speaker of the House for the first time. The choice was easy. Madigan had recently redrawn Illinois’ legislative maps, which meant many lawmakers in part owed their jobs to the 40-year-old from Chicago’s Southwest Side..  Madigan has now held that speaker’s gavel for 35 of the last 37 years. The state’s median age is 37 years old, meaning one man has served as speaker for the vast majority of most Illinoisans’ lives. No legislative leader in American history has held power for longer..  But much has changed for Illinois state government since 1983..  The state’s credit rating has fallen from the highest tier to the lowest in U.S. history, just one notch above “junk” status. It is home to the most severe pension crisis in U.S. history, with pension costs eating up more than 25% of state spending as social services are hollowed out. And residents now shoulder the heaviest tax burden of any state..  Madigan remains..  But with the exception of a Republican-controlled House from 1995-1997, he has never appeared more vulnerable. The speaker’s inner circle has been mired in controversy for more than a year, from FBI raids and wiretaps, to sexual harassment scandals, to what appears to be a cover-up of rape and ghost-payrolling. This controversy has not yet been enough for a single sitting member of his caucus, or Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, to call for his resignation from the speakership..  How has one man consolidated so much power? Five pillars explain his reign..  1) The rulebook.  Parliamentary rules approved by the Illinois House of Representatives every two years grant the speaker more power than any other state legislative leader in the nation. These rules allow Madigan to personally hand out lucrative committee chair positions and block votes on key legislation at will. Leaked emails uncovered by WBEZ show Madigan’s closest confidant, former state lawmaker and high-powered lobbyist Mike McClain, maintained a “magic lobbyist list” that special interests could hire to curry favor with the speaker..  2) Political purse strings.  Madigan’s dual role as speaker and chairman of the Democratic Party of Illinois gives him direct control over both policy and politics. Case in point: In addition to his lobbyist list, McClain maintained a “magic Excel sheet” of key political donors dubbed the “Most Trusted of the Trusted.” No other state legislative leader in the U.S. also serves as the state party head..  3) Cartographer-in-chief.  Madigan controls the map, drawing Illinois’ political boundaries for three of the past four decades. On the campaign trail, Pritzker promised an independent mapmaking process following the 2020 Census, but has yet to endorse a bipartisan constitutional amendment in the Illinois Senate that would ensure just that..  4) Property tax rainmaker.  The speaker makes over $1 million “in a good year” through his law firm, which specializes in Cook County property tax appeals. Owners of some of the region’s most valuable real estate can feel pressured to hire Madigan & Getzendanner, which Madigan founded in 1972, in an attempt to lower their property tax burdens..  5) The power of patronage.  Rising to prominence under the wing of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, one of the most important lessons Madigan learned was that building a patronage army was the key to longevity..  Through accumulation of unprecedented state debt, the speaker has built an army of political foot soldiers who owe generous pensions, early retirements and other perks to the speaker’s protection..  WBEZ uncovered a 2012 email showing McClain fought to protect one state worker, Forrest Ashby, from discipline, telling state officials Ashby had “kept his mouth shut” about “the rape in Champaign” and “Jones’ ghost employees.” Pritzker’s gubernatorial campaign later hired Ashby on McClain’s recommendation. A response to a Freedom of Information Act request shows how someone like Ashby might remain loyal in the face of wrongdoing. He retired in 2018 at age 54, after contributing $120,000 toward his retirement over his 29 years in state government. Ashby will receive an estimated $2.7 million in pension payments..  Madigan’s longevity is not an accident. It is the product of consolidating power through policy choices..  And even as federal authorities circle overhead, he isn’t letting up..  In 2019, Madigan voted for a constitutional amendment to scrap a key constraint on Springfield’s taxing power: the state’s flat income tax protection, which voters approved as part of the Illinois Constitution in 1970. Madigan was a delegate to that constitutional convention 50 years ago..  While Pritzker is selling the ballot question to voters as a $3.7 billion “fair tax,” polling shows nearly half of Illinoisans view the amendment as little more than a “blank check” for state lawmakers. Rather than fairness, it is a question of power..  Most Illinoisans have never cast a vote for Madigan. Rather, a small district near Midway Airport sends him to the Statehouse and other state lawmakers make him speaker..  But on Nov. 3, 2020, they will decide whether to vote for or against his power.

151,"The regulators are also asking for records on affordability using these metrics for various ZIP codes and census tracts..  The utilities must provide the information for each year from 2013 to 2019..  Once the information gathering is done, the commission may use what it finds to impose new rules on utilities..  For now, what the utilities submit will be made public. It’s possible some companies might seek to provide the information without making it available publicly..  The ICC’s move comes as it has required utilities throughout the state to pause any disconnections for nonpayment while the coronavirus pandemic continues. But affordability of heat and electricity is an issue that predated the economic crisis precipitated by the worst health emergency in over a century..  For example, at Peoples Gas, the utility responsible for home heat in the city of Chicago, the cost of uncollectible bills has exploded in recent years. It was a record $60 million in 2019..  The annual cost of home heat for the average household in Chicago exceeds $1,100 now—though natural gas prices are at historic lows..  But the utility and its Milwaukee-based parent, WEC Energy Group, bear no risk from that cost, as state law permits passing along the price tag of unpaid bills to paying customers in the form of a monthly surcharge. That’s true of Nicor and ComEd as well..  Massive infrastructure programs at all the utilities have meant much higher capital expenditures, and state laws enacted years ago make it easy for utilities to recover the costs quickly via higher charges on ratepayers. That translates ultimately into higher delivery rates for power and gas—and higher monthly bills for households and businesses. It also means dividends at the utilities’ parent companies are increasing 5 to 7 percent annually..  The information the ICC is demanding isn’t likely to be available soon. Utilities must respond no later than 60 days after Gov. J.B. Pritzker declares an end to the coronavirus emergency. Letter to the Editor.  Have something to get off your chest?

While completing the census form might not be on everyone’s immediate to-do list at the moment, state officials say it’s vitally important. Many believe the census is much more that just another survey, because it will eventually determine how much of an individual’s tax dollars the state gets back from the federal government and it helps decide how much power Illinois will have in terms of congressional representation and electoral college votes for the next decade. As of April 1st, nearly 45 percent of Illinois residents had replied to the U.S. Census. The citizens around the state should have already received instructions on how to complete the census in the mail.

Close Send email to this address Enter Your Name Send Email Cancel With Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Cory Booker, Julián Castro and Andrew Yang dropping out of the Democratic primary, the race has become almost exclusively white; led by Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, followed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden. This lack of diversity in candidates is coupled with critiques of Iowa and New Hampshire’s early influence despite their disproportionately white populations that don’t reflect the demographics of the rest of the United States. These concerns in mind, Gov. J.B. Pritzker plans to make a bid that Illinois, rather than Iowa, should go first in the primary process. “If you’re looking for a state whose people represent the diversity of America, look no further than Illinois,” Pritzker said in a tweet. “It’s time for the most representative state in the country to be the first in the nation.” In the tweet, he linked an NPR article that cited Illinois as the overall winner in their “Perfect State Index” that took race, age, income and education into account in comparison to U.S. averages. Pritzker continued at a press conference last week in Springfield, citing Illinois’s comprehensive diversity as the driving justification. “This state is a diverse state in so many ways, in ways that Iowa and New Hampshire are not,” Pritzker said, going on to reference Illinois’s mix of rural, urban and suburban areas as well as the racial demographics. This push comes after the rocky release of results and technical difficulties at Iowa caucuses as well as weeks of blunders by the Illinois Secretary of State’s office in their implementation of automatic voting registration – accidentally registering noncitizens and citizens under 18 years of age. Despite this, Pritzker thinks Illinois is the best state to be first. “We represent every aspect of the United States in Illinois,” Pritzker said, “and I think it’s appropriate of us to put ourselves first in the nation. If you can win in a state like this then you’re worthy of being the nominee of your party.” Iowa is 90.7 percent white, 4 percent black or African American and 6.2 percent Hispanic or Latinx, compared to the U.S.’ 76.5 percent, 13.4 percent and 18.3 percent respectively, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Illinois is 76.9 percent white, 14.6 percent black or African American and 17.4 percent Hispanic or Latinx. New Hampshire, second in the primary process, is 93.2 percent white, 1.7 percent black or African American and 3.9 percent Hispanic or Latinx. “Illinois’ racial demographics are much more closely representative to the demographics of the larger country,” said Annie Scoltack, a junior sociology major at DePaul. “Also, Illinois has almost four times the population of Iowa so I think it is definitely a more reasonable representation of the Midwest as compared to Iowa.” “To be frank, there are more black and brown people in Illinois,” she added, “So it’s more representative.” Going first in the primary isn’t the end-all-be-all of determining the Democratic nomination, but it’s important. The order of the primary doesn’t change the number of delegates a state gets in the national convention, but it can give momentum. “The hope is that the winner in your state, if first or early, influences the states that come afterwards,” said Craig Sutter, part time professor in the School of Professional and Continuing Studies who also creates television and radio campaigns for political candidates. This is often true. Only one candidate who’s placed lower than third in the Iowa caucuses has gone on to win the Democratic nomination. Sautter doesn’t think Iowa is going to give up their place freely and New Hampshire will likely keep their place as the first primary vote, despite being even wealthier and whiter than Iowa. “It is still popular with candidates, because it is small enough to get out and meet voters face-to-face,” he said, “and it is on the East Coast, easily available to reporters and media.” In 2008, Illinois did move their primary earlier – from the third Tuesday in March to the second Tuesday in February so that it could be relevant in the Democratic primary for Barack Obama. The date was moved back after the 2010 election. Sautter commented that sometimes Illinois residents complain that by the time March comes around, one candidate already has enough delegates to win. While this wasn’t true with Obama in 2008, it was in 1992 with Bill Clinton and in 2000 with Al Gore. A concern with moving Illinois earlier is also Chicago’s expensive media market. Iowa’s inexpensive market gives the opportunity for candidates without a massive financial backing to gain momentum. Nielsen DMA rated Chicago as the third best media market. Des Moines-Ames is 68th. “[The expensive media market] is a disadvantage to lesser known candidates who otherwise might emerge from the battle in smaller, less expensive states,” Sautter said. Sautter is also not convinced moving Illinois up will even change its impact. Where the state is now, he said, could help “push a candidate over the top” after Super Tuesday, citing Bill Clinton and Al Gore’s election. Another concern, Illinois weather. “We could make a change and end up having less impact,” Sautter said, “stuck in a February snow or ice storm with low turn-out.”","[0.5049351453781128, 0.4950648546218872]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5049351453781128

162,"Illinois man educates white neighbors about Black History Updated 1:43 pm PDT, Thursday, June 25, 2020.  ELMWOOD, Ill. (AP) — A Black man in rural Illinois has started an online video series to educate his white neighbors about Black history following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis..  Brandon Butler, an Elmwood resident, figured that many white people don’t understand Black people’s plight because they are ignorant about the Black experience, the Journal Star reported Thursday. So, he launched “Welcome to “Brandon’s Black History,” a weekly presentation to engage the predominately white community where he lives with his family..  “I think it’s something that needs to be done,” Butler, 35, told watchers during one of his meetings. “And I’ll keep on doing it as long as it can.”.  Elmwood had 1,945 residents, 0.15% of whom were African American, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. That's about three people, which Butler said is about right..  Butler created Brandon’s Black History, a Facebook page, and dropped a link to his video meeting on June 9. He talked about Black Wall Street, an African American commercial district in Oklahoma that was destroyed by white a mob in 1921. He discussed Juneteenth and the Black Panther Party in following videos..  “We don’t get all of Black history in school,” Butler noted. “We get the basic highlights of Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and slaves, but that’s it. I figured, what better time than now to teach history.”.  Todd Hollis, who coaches football alongside Butler at Elmwood-Brimfield High School, said the lessons have been “eye-opening"" for him and others watching..  Even Butler's personal stories seem to shock his viewers. Recently, he recalled a racial encounter where a white woman told him: “I don’t know who gave you permission to live here,"" and went on to call him a racial slur. Two white strangers told the woman: “We love him. He’s with us. ... We want him here.”.  Kristin Faulkner, Elmwood resident, said Butler's willingness to speak honestly about his experiences is helping the community..  “I have seen the impact in three weeks on the hearts and minds of people in this small community,” Faulkner said..  Butler has seen many familiar faces during his virtual meetups. But he also welcomes new people, even those with differing views..  “Maybe I can open up their eyes, too,” Butler said..  Floyd died after an officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes. His death sparked protests worldwide against racial injustice and police brutality.

When she needs to take an Uber or Lyft for work, they are “quite expensive,” costing $20-$30 even for short trips..  By contrast, such trips closer to where she lives in Lakeview East are “only ever 12 bucks,” she said..  “Even though my work pays for these, we’re a nonprofit and we don’t have an unlimited budget,” Lee said. “So often times, when I have to go somewhere, it feels like this is maybe way too much for how far I’m actually going.”.  A recent study shows Lee’s experience may be part of a larger pattern of Uber and Lyft charging higher prices for riders being dropped off in predominately non-white neighborhoods of Chicago..  The study, from two researchers at George Washington University, showed ride-hailing fares in Chicago increased per mile for trips where a person was dropped off in a neighborhood with a high percentage of non-white residents..  Researchers Akshat Pandey and Aylin Caliskan said their study found dynamic pricing models — used by ride sharing services but not taxis — have been found to lead to “racially-based price disparities.”.  The study also concludes riders may see their fares change if they’re picked up or dropped off in neighborhoods where residents skew younger or where most residents haven’t obtained a college degree. People are also being charged more when getting picked up in areas with more expensive homes, according to the study..  The researchers said such riders may be facing “social bias.”.  The two said their study is the first “large-scale fairness” review of algorithms used to determine the prices set by ride-hailing apps..  Chicago was chosen for the research because it has laws that ask ride-share companies to disclose their fare prices, according to the study. Uber and Lyft rides in Chicago are among the most expensive in the country, thanks to new taxes on single rides in certain areas of the city..  The study used U.S. Census data and data from more than 100 million ride-hailing trips in Chicago between November 2018 to December 2019..  Kate Lowe, an associate professor of urban planning at University of Illinois at Chicago, said she was not surprised about the role race may play in the pricing of Ubers and Lyfts within the city’s geography..  Lowe, who studies transportation, said ride-hailing apps can have an important role in expanding access for residents of non-white neighborhoods and low-income households..  “What this study shows aligns with what many people across social sciences find, which is — in a world characterized by structural racism — market mechanisms are often going to reflect and reinforce structural racism,” she said..  An Uber spokesperson said the company does not condone discrimination through algorithms or users and praised studies researching the impact of dynamic pricing..  Still, the spokesperson said the study may have overlooked numerous other factors in its analysis..  “It’s important not to equate correlation for causation, and there may be a number of relevant factors that weren’t taken into account for this analysis, such as correlations with land-use/neighborhood patterns, trip purposes, time of day, and other effects,” the company statement read. “We look forward to seeing the final results.”.  A Lyft spokesperson responded similarly to a recent article about the study in Salon , saying the analysis was “deeply flawed” and race did not factor into its dynamic pricing..  The authors said in a statement to Block Club Chicago the study demonstrates “price discrimination correlates highly with the demographics of pickup and dropoff locations.”.  “These findings cannot provide direct insights on causality, yet precisely quantify the unintentional disparate impact that puts historically disadvantaged groups residing at particular neighborhoods at a further disadvantage,” the researchers said..  This same pricing model has been researched before. The study points to a 2015 analysis that showed The Princeton Review, a test prep company, charged higher prices to individuals in areas with more Asian Americans..  Already subscribe?

166,"By Alden Loury , Esther Yoon-Ji Kang Thursday, June 25, 9:42 PM UTC.  Illinois’ population has declined for the sixth year in a row, but some racial groups are growing in number, according to new population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau released Thursday..  Asians are the fastest growing racial demographic in the state, increasing by 24% since 2010 and now making up 5.7% of Illinois’ population. They were followed by Latinos, whose population has grown by 9.5% since 2010 and now accounts for 17.5% of the state’s total. The growth of Asian population in Illinois mirrors a national trend; the number of Asian residents in the U.S. has increased 29% since 2010..  According to the data, Illinois has also witnessed the steepest decline in Black population among all U.S. states since 2010 — both in number and by percentage. The state’s Black population has fallen by about 56,000, or 3%, since 2010..  There has also been a significant decline in white population in Illinois, a loss of about 6% since 2010, although white residents still make up more than 60% of the state’s total population..  In the 14-county, tri-state, Chicago metropolitan area population has largely remained flat, even as other metro areas in the U.S. — particularly in southern and western states — have grown. The 2019 estimate for metro Chicago is 9,458,539, a decline of 2,566, or 0.03%, from the region’s population of 9,461,105 in 2010. In 2019, the region’s population declined for the fifth straight year and dipped below the 2010 count for the first time, according to the estimates..  Since 2010, total population has declined in six of the region’s 14 counties, most notably in Cook County where it declined by more than 44,400. Total population has fallen in Lake County, Ind., by more than 10,500 and in Lake County, Ill., by almost 7,000. The other eight counties, including Kane and Will counties, saw modest growth. Kendall County saw the largest percentage increase in population, growing by 12.4% since 2010..  Overall, the white population in metro Chicago has declined by more than 260,000 since 2010. White population has declined in every county in the region with the exception of Kendall County, where it has increased by 2.0%. In 2019, white residents accounted for nearly 52.4% of the region’s total population. That’s down from 55.1% in 2010..  Overall, Black population has fallen in the region by more than 76,500 or 4.7% since 2010. That decline is due almost entirely to heavy losses in Cook County (about 85,200) and in Lake County, Ind., (nearly 12,800). Elsewhere in the region, the Black population has grown by nearly 21,500..  Both the Asian and Latino populations increased in all 14 counties in the region. Overall, the Asian population has increased by nearly 130,000 or 24.2% since 2010, according to the estimates. That growth includes an increase in Asian population of more than 74,300 in Cook County, nearly 22,700 in DuPage County and almost 13,100 in Lake County, Ill..  Latino population in the region has grown by about 175,700 or 9.0% since 2010. While Latino population has increased by about 74,500 in Cook County, much of the region’s Latino growth has occurred elsewhere. That growth includes significant increases of Latino population in several counties, ranging from more than 7,400 in McHenry County to nearly 20,000 in Will County..

Overall, Black population has fallen in the region by more than 76,500 or 4.7% since 2010. That decline is due almost entirely to heavy losses in Cook County (about 85,200) and in Lake County, Ind., (nearly 12,800). Elsewhere in the region, the Black population has grown by nearly 21,500..  Both the Asian and Latino populations increased in all 14 counties in the region. Overall, the Asian population has increased by nearly 130,000 or 24.2% since 2010, according to the estimates. That growth includes an increase in Asian population of more than 74,300 in Cook County, nearly 22,700 in DuPage County and almost 13,100 in Lake County, Ill..  Latino population in the region has grown by about 175,700 or 9.0% since 2010. While Latino population has increased by about 74,500 in Cook County, much of the region’s Latino growth has occurred elsewhere. That growth includes significant increases of Latino population in several counties, ranging from more than 7,400 in McHenry County to nearly 20,000 in Will County..

169,"More Blacks in Oak Lawn have died of COVID-19 than most small towns outside of Chicago Posted By 1427.  By Erick Johnson.  Fifteen miles southwest of Chicago is the Village of Oak Lawn. The U.S. Census says the town is 67 percent white, but when COVID-19 struck, its Black residents had more deaths from the disease despite making up only seven percent of the population..  According to the latest figures from the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office, 83 people in Oak Lawn have died from COVID-19 since March. This includes 38 Blacks, 32 whites, 8 Latinos, one Asian and 4, which were classified as other..  Sandwiched between Evergreen Park and Chicago Ridge, Oak Lawn has 56,420 residents. That includes 3,949 Blacks and a growing Latino population that make up 21 percent or 11,848 of Oak Lawn residents. With the vibe of a suburb, Oak Lawn’s Black population has been hit harder than many predominately Black cities outside Chicago, including Country Club Hills, Chicago Heights and South Holland..  Among Oak Lawn’s COVID-19 Black deaths, 28 were females and 10 were males. One victim was between the ages of 18 to 35. One was between 36 to 48. Fifteen Black victims in Oak Lawn were between 62 to 77. Twenty victims were over the age of 78..  A total of 26 Blacks died of COVID-19 at nursing homes and a rehabilitation facility in Oak Lawn, Cook County Medical data shows. Eight died at ManorCare Health Services-Oak Lawn West, seven at Oak Lawn Respiratory and Rehabilitation Center, six at Aperion Care Oak Lawn and five at ManorCare Health Services-Oak Lawn East..  By comparison, in Chicago Heights, 22 Blacks have died since the pandemic began. Eight of those victims were over 77. Twenty Blacks in South Holland died from COVID-19. And fifteen of those victims, or 75 percent, were over the age of 77. In Country Club Hills, out of 20, nine were older than 79..  Meanwhile, the number of new cases in predominately Black municipalities outside of Chicago continue to stabilize. Out of 23 zip codes, 14 saw the number of new cases remain the same or drop from the previous week. They include North Chicago, Waukegan, Chicago Heights, Harvey, Markham, South Holland and Country Club Hills..  Many of those municipalities have new cases in the single digits. In Markham, there were five new COVID-19 cases on Monday, June 22, compared to 13 on June 14..  In Chicago, the number of new cases continue to drop in many Black neighborhoods. Overall in Chicago, about 1,099 Blacks have died from COVID-19, according to the Chicago Department of Public Health..  On Friday, June 26, Chicago and the state were scheduled to enter Phase 4 with some Black restaurants planning to reopen for in-room dining, including Daley’s in Woodlawn, Norm’s Bistro and Chicago Chicken and Waffles in Bronzeville. On the West Side, an employee at McArthur’s was not sure whether the restaurant would reopen that day for in-room dining..  Statewide, Governor J.B. Pritzker said 400,000 Illinois residents were set to return to work as the state moves into Phase 4 on June 26. New guidelines will allow key leisure, recreation and business sectors to safely reopen..  Phase 4 allows for the safe reopening or expansion of several key business segments – such as health and fitness, movies and theater, museums and zoos, as well as indoor dining at restaurants..  Phase 4 also allows for expanded gathering sizes, increasing the limit from 10 in Phase 3, to 50 people or fewer. This expanded gathering limit extends to key activities like meetings, events and funerals..  Residents are still urged to wear face masks and practice social distancing..  In Washington Park, the DuSable Museum of African American History on its website did not indicate whether they will reopen on Friday, but the museum said it will stay closed until June 26..  Meanwhile on June 22, the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County reported that an employee tested positive after taking a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) antibody blood test. Antibody blood tests check one’s blood by looking for antibodies, which show if you have had a previous infection with the COVID-19..  Jalyne R. Strong-Shaw, Chief Public Information Officer, said the employee was assigned to the Executive Office at the Richard J. Daley Center, 50 W. Washington St. – Room 1001, Chicago..  The employee believes that he/she had COVID-19 months ago..  The employee who received the positive antibody blood test result has not identified any other employees whom he/she came in close contact with within the Executive Office or in other departments, divisions, districts or agencies..  Notification is being sent to all Clerk’s Office employees regarding the employee who received a positive antibody test result..  Since the individual who received a positive antibody test result believes that he/she was COVID-19 positive months ago and the Clerk’s Office is unable to confirm when he/she was COVID-19 positive, MB Real Estate will perform its regular cleaning and not a deep cleaning of the area where the employee worked..  To date, 26 employees of the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County have tested positive for coronavirus, and four (4) employees have received positive antibody test results after taking coronavirus antibodies blood tests..

172,"WTTW News.  State Sen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park.  After more than a decade, the Illinois Senate finally has a new leader. But newly installed Senate President Don Harmon will have to wrestle with the same cast of snapping demons as predecessor John Cullerton..  Harmon, a 53-year-old Oak Park attorney, takes the helm at a time when state government is rapidly changing, but is also caught in long-festering trials, with everything from taxation to racial splits and political corruption claiming attention. Harmon was able to handily defeat challenger Kim Lightford for the post, thanks to his skill as a politician. Now he has to show his chops as a leader in both competition and cooperation with House Speaker Mike Madigan and Gov. J.B. Pritzker..  Curbing corruption without alienating his members is job one..  Federal agents are crawling all over Springfield in a perhaps unprecedented probe of misconduct, with one of Harmon’s Democratic members awaiting trial on federal embezzlement charges, a second having recently resigned after raids on his office and a third reportedly agreeing to wear a wire after the feds started examining him..  Cullerton was somewhat slow to deal with that, perhaps listening to his inner assistant public defender, his first job. Harmon knows there’s a problem, and in post-election remarks, he said senators must act to “change the culture” of Springfield. But how far he’s willing to go is a work in progress, with Harmon backing expanded economic disclosures but also being pushed to outlaw lobbying by public officials and perhaps second jobs at all, like his position as a lawyer..  A related issue coming up fast is how the General Assembly will reapportion itself after this year’s U.S. Census..  Harmon’s members clearly are most interested in getting themselves and their associates re-elected and keeping power. There’s good cause to think that’s a major reason why Harmon got more votes than Lightford..  After all, Harmon has more than $2.2 million in his political war chest and has a reputation of going out of his way to help colleagues raise money and lend them precinct help from Oak Park, where he heads that township’s Democratic organization..  But the new leader also is considered a bit of a reformer and is under strong pressure not to rubber-stamp a Democratic gerrymander. Asked about that recently by TV interviewer Mark Maxwell, Harmon hedged, saying he’s “open to considering” remap reform but also describing the state’s current, Democrat-dominated map as “unusually fair.”.  Then there’s the fact that Harmon, who apparently gained from a split among African-American senators, will have to form alliances not only with minority lawmakers but women, who thought their time had come..  One way to deal with that would be to intensify efforts to end, or at least limit, sexual harassment, another part of Springfield’s toxic culture. There’s a widespread feeling among female legislators I talk to that ruling boys so far have done only half the job..  Another toughie: Passing real property tax relief..  Harmon is a big backer of Pritzker’s proposed graduated income tax and helped push language authorizing the upcoming referendum through the Senate. But there’s increasing concern among some advocates that unless voters see proof that hated property taxes are going down, they’ll resist raising the income tax, if arguably only on wealthy people..  A legislative commission examining ideas for property-tax reform so far has been split by partisan divisions. The subject badly needs a powerful leader to simplify the subject into three or four understandable notions, and then exercise some muscle to get them moving..  Maybe it’s Harmon..  All in all, you have to hand it to the guy for winning a race in which many thought he was a distinct underdog. Lots of folks were betting against Harmon, who is a little more conservative than Cullerton and, ironically, went to the same college prep high school as the currently much-derided Madigan: St. Ignatius..  Now Harmon gets his chance. I wish him good luck. Read more ","[0.5086580514907837, 0.4913419485092163]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5086580514907837
173,"Illinois Historic Preservation Tax Credit Program Benefiting Communities / MyRadioLink.com January 22, 2020 11:09 am For Immediate Release Illinois Historic Preservation Tax Credit Program Benefiting Communities.  SPRINGFIELD, Ill. – The Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) today announced the second round of recipients for a new statewide historic preservation income tax credit program encouraging private investment in historic properties in Illinois. The second round allocated credits to three projects creating affordable artist or senior housing in Granite City, Rock Island and Moline..  “The program has incentivized private investment to create much needed affordable, veteran, and senior housing, construction jobs, boost local economies and bring unused buildings back to life and back onto the tax rolls,” said IDNR Director Colleen Callahan. “Together with the related businesses located in those buildings, millions in state and local tax revenues are generated.”.  Priority is given to buildings that are in low-income census tracts, federally-declared disaster areas, and counties that border a state with a competitive statewide historic tax credit. Buildings that were once owned by a government entity, and whose development partnership includes a Community Development Entity, a low-profit organization, or a not-for-profit organization also are given priority for an allocation..  The following three historic building renovations received an allocation for future state income tax credits in the second round of Illinois Historic Preservation Tax Credits: • Arsenal Courts in Rock Island, built during WWII as emergency housing for workers at the Rock Island Arsenal, is being rehabilitated into affordable housing. • The former Granite City YMCA is being converted into affordable housing, as well as commercial space, art studios, and a gallery. • The former Garfield School in Moline is being rehabilitated as affordable senior housing..  During this first year of the Illinois Historic Preservation Tax Credit Program, complete applications were received from applicants representing a total of 25 historic properties in 12 different communities. The total private investment of all projects applying to the program is estimated to be more than $600 million. The total amount of credits requested were approximately $54 million. Due to program caps, only $15 million in credits were allocated to seven projects in 2019. However, that $15 million is leveraging more than $152 million in private expenditures..  The Illinois Historic Preservation Tax Credit Program, administered by the IDNR State Historic Preservation Office, is available to owners of historic structures who undertake certified rehabilitations making them eligible for a tax credit of up to $3 million per project based on a percentage of their rehabilitation costs. Credits are limited to a total of $15 million in allocations per year, with a total of $75 million in tax credits available over the five years that the program is to be in effect..  Of the seven projects allocated state credits this year, six created either senior, affordable veterans, or artist housing. The following four historic building renovations received an allocation for a future state income tax credit in the first round allocated in August 2019: • The former Hotel Belleville, located at 16 South Illinois Street, Belleville, will be converted into affordable senior housing with ground floor retail. • The former Cook County Hospital Administration Building, located at 1835 West Harrison Street, Chicago, will be converted into two hotels, offices, and retail. • The former Paris High School, located at 309 South Main in Paris, Illinois will be rehabilitated into affordable and senior apartments. • The former nurses’ quarters at Edward Hines, Jr., VA Hospital (Building #14), located at 5000 South 5th Avenue, Hines, will be rehabilitated into supportive veterans housing..  The tax credits are not issued until each project is successfully completed meeting all program requirements and substantial private investment will already have been made in these communities before the credit is issued..

176,"Gov. J.B. Pritzker speaks about the state’s COVID-19 response Wednesday at the Jackson County courthouse in downstate Murphysboro. BlueRoomStream The largest single-day spike in Illinois’ number of confirmed COVID-19 cases brought the state’s total to 288 Wednesday as the viral pandemic expands its reach across the United States. And there’s a good chance you could be next, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said, in his most pointed plea yet for residents to stay home to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. “If you don’t feel well, please stay home. … You should just assume that you may have coronavirus. Just assume that,” Pritzker said during a news conference in downstate Murphysboro. “What would you do? You should self-isolate. That is the right thing to do.” The 128 new cases extended to two new counties, Kendall and Madison, and 17 overall. Patients have ranged in age from 9 to 91, with 20 new cases dealing the latest blows to a DuPage County nursing home that has now tallied 42 cases — 30 residents and 12 staffers. Statewide numbers will continue to jump “significantly” as more testing becomes available, according to Illinois Department of Public Health Director Ngozi Ezike. Just over 2,000 tests had been administered as of Wednesday afternoon. Things will get worse “These numbers in Illinois will become much worse before they get better,” Pritzker said, calling obtaining more test kits “the biggest challenge we face.” “Some of you might look at the illnesses and death in other countries and think, ‘Well that couldn’t happen here.’ Make no mistake: no place and no person is immune from COVID-19. The difference between where we are in our response and where other nations are is just a few weeks,” Pritzker said. “We must act with urgency.” Some of those patients have recovered since the state’s first case was confirmed Jan. 24, but the first death in Illinois attributed to the pandemic was reported Tuesday after a 61-year-old South Side woman died at the University of Chicago Medical Center. More campus cases Illinois’ total also includes patients from DePaul University, Columbia College and the University of Chicago, which each reported that students, staffers or faculty members had been diagnosed with COVID-19 . Those schools are among hundreds of others that have shut down campuses — or will soon do so — following Pritzker’s order last week that closed elementary and high schools for more than 2.2 million students at least through the end of the month in an effort to limit interaction and slow the spread of the virus. A North Side private school reported six cases stemming from a fundraiser held earlier this month, though no students were among the confirmed carriers. The latest Illinois toll was announced hours after President Donald Trump called himself a “wartime president” up against the virus, invoking the Defense Production Act to boost production of medical supplies. The federal Treasury Department also announced it planned to begin issuing $500 billion in direct payments to Americans starting next month to help stabilize an economy mired by the viral threat. That could be good news for thousands of Illinois service and hospitality industry workers trying to scrape by after the governor’s unprecedented move to shutter bars and restaurants except for carryout service. Several shopping malls in the metro area and a slew of department stores made plans to close, too. Mayor’s primetime address Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who announced she’d deliver a primetime address to Chicagoans Thursday night outlining the city’s “comprehensive and proactive steps” to confront the pandemic, also tried to ease the burden on some residents beset by the shutdown. The city announced it would pause debt collection, ticketing and towing. Additionally, the state Commerce Commission announced an emergency order for a moratorium on utility disconnections. Beyond the school and business closures, the state has stopped short of a full-on “shelter-in-place” order similar to in California, but Pritzker’s office has said “the situation is being monitored on an ongoing basis.” The situation was different in Oak Park, though, where Mayor Anan Abu-Taleb declared a local state of emergency and issued an order requiring residents to shelter in place starting March 20 through April 3. “I do want to assure all of you, essential services will always remain available — grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations. The things we all need will not be closing down,” Pritzker said Wednesday. Statehouse cancels session, census delays count That doesn’t extend to the state Capitol, though. After a hectic election day hobbled by low turnout in the wake of COVID-19 concerns, lawmakers announced the statehouse was canceling its session next week, wiping out a second week of the legislative calendar. And an accurate count of Illinois residents could be the next casualty of the pandemic. The U.S. Census Bureau announced it was suspending its once-per-decade field operations already underway at least until April 1, to “help protect the health and safety of the American public, Census Bureau employees.” Contributing : Tina Sfondeles, Manny Ramos, David Struett In This Stream","[0.5015653967857361, 0.49843457341194153]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5015653967857361

Not Likely, Harvard Estimates Show Sponsored By.  By Dave Savini, Samah Assad, Chris Hacker, and Michelle Youngerman.  The number of those tested positive for coronavirus in Illinois continues to climb. Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced new cases on Wednesday , bringing the total to 288 people spanning 17 counties..  The increased need for testing and treatment comes with questions surrounding whether Chicago hospitals are prepared to handle an influx of patients. Data released Tuesday by the Harvard Global Health Institute (HGHI) reveals the city may not have enough beds at local hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) for the number of people who will ultimately be infected..  A team of HGHI researchers utilized data from the American Hospital Association, the American Hospital Directory and the U.S. Census to arrive at their estimates. The model is built on bed capacity data for each of 306 U.S. hospital markets, or hospital referral regions, in collaboration with ProPublica and The New York Times ..  The projected numbers are based on estimates and scenarios that between 20 and 60 percent of Americans will ultimately be infected with COVID-19. The team selected three different timeframes – 6, 12 and 18 months — to identify how resources would be strained if the total number of cases was spread out over those timeframes..  Hospital Beds In Chicago.  CBS 2 Investigators examined the team’s “best case model” — data that specifically estimated the impact if 20 percent of Chicago’s population, or 409,014 people, got the virus..  Chicago has an average of 7,764 hospital beds, according to the data. Less than half, or 3,161, are available for new patients..  That’s despite the model’s estimate that of those projected to be infected, 20% — or 83,531 — are expected to be hospitalized at some point during the course of the pandemic. These are annualized averages based on yearly occupancy rates, researchers said..  The Need For ICU Beds.  The model also estimated an average of 912 ICU beds citywide with only a third (312) available..  However, the data projects 17,529 people in Chicago would need ICU care during the course of the pandemic..  If 40 percent of the population was infected, they estimated 35,059 ICU beds would be needed..  In addition, 52,588 would be needed if 60 percent of the population is infected (the researchers’“worst case model”)..  The estimates show if 40 percent of the Chicago population is infected within six months, the city would need 2,337 ICU beds to care for them, which is almost four times as many ICU beds are potentially available..  “…It’s critically important to flatten the curve,” said Ben Jacobson, research assistant with with HGHI. “And the more that people practice social distancing and slow the rate of transmission, the less strain is placed on the hospital system.”.  Chicago Hospital Plans.  Rush University Medical Center is one local hospital in “surge” mode working to put contingency plan in place for potential patient overflow. It’s hospital tower, designed for an outbreak like coronavirus, has 40 negative pressure rooms to contain infectious particles in the air to its respective room..  Its emergency department is divided into three 20-bed units that can be isolated. In two hours, they said, a wing of the hospital can be converted into a negative pressure ward to treat more patients and nearly double isolation room capacity from 40 to 72..  CBS 2 requested information from Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago’s Office of Emergency Management & Communications, and the Illinois Department of Public Health about their plans to handle potential patient overflow, including whether or not they’re considering other sites for temporary treatment. CBS 2 has not received responses..  Jacobson said even with curve flattening, the HGHI team projects greater demand for ICU care than available capacity — not only in Chicago, but across the country..  “As such, hospitals and hospital leaders need to begin finding creative ways to expand capacity,” he said. “Whether through cancelling elective procedures, repurposing ambulatory surgical centers as ICUs or other strategies.”.

179,"When lockdown orders from the COVID-19 pandemic went into effect across the country, car traffic declined significantly. But research from the Governors Highway Safety Administration (GHSA) shows that even though there were fewer cars on the road during this time, speeding and reckless driving increased. While the relatively empty streets might lull drivers into a false sense of security, speeding is still dangerous and claims the lives of nearly 10,000 Americans every year..  Speeding is responsible for more than a quarter of all traffic fatalities in the U.S. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) considers a crash to be speeding-related if one of the drivers is cited for a speeding-related offense or if an officer determines that driving too fast for conditions, racing, or exceeding the speed limit was a contributing factor in the crash..  While NHTSA data shows that both the share of traffic fatalities related to speeding and the speeding-related fatality rate have been declining in recent years, these rates vary at the state level. Nationwide, the average annual speeding-related fatality rate for the five year period from 2014-2018 was 2.97 per 100,000 people. However, at the state level, there is a statistically significant relationship between speeding-related fatalities per capita and the maximum posted speed limit in the state. States with higher posted speed limits often experience more speed-related fatalities..  Another significant factor in speed-related deaths is alcohol consumption. Data shows that over the past five years, 47 percent of all speed-related deaths involved a driver with a positive blood alcohol content (BAC). Among U.S. states, there is a strong positive correlation between the share of fatalities due to speeding and the share of drivers in fatal accidents with a positive BAC..  In light of the increase in speeding during COVID-19, researchers at CoPilot, a car shopping app that helps guide users through the buying process, wanted to examine which states and counties historically suffer from the most speeding-related deaths. The analysts used data from the NHTSA, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety to rank which states have the most speeding-related fatalities as a share of all vehicle fatalities. It is worth noting that the data used in the analysis was collected from 2014-2018 and therefore does not reflect recent driving behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic..  The analysis found that in Illinois, 39.9% of total traffic deaths involve speeding. Out of all states, Illinois has the 7th highest percentage of traffic deaths that involve speeding in the U.S. Here is a summary of the data for Illinois: Traffic fatalities that involve speeding: 39.9% of total Speeding-related traffic fatality rate per 100k: 3.21 Total traffic fatalities that involve speeding (past 5 years): 2,043 Total traffic fatalities (past 5 years): 5,121 Maximum posted speed limit: 70 mph Worst county for speeding: Will.  For reference, here are the statistics for the entire United States: Traffic fatalities that involve speeding: 27.0% of total Speeding-related traffic fatality rate per 100k: 2.97 Total traffic fatalities that involve speeding (past 5 years): 48,622 Total traffic fatalities (past 5 years): 180,067 Maximum posted speed limit: 85 mph (Texas) Worst county for speeding: Washington County, RI.

180,"By Natalie Moore Tuesday, June 23, 11 AM UTC.  The Chicagoland Opportunity Zones Consortium has formed to ensure that a federal tax program created for rich investors to fund development in low-income communities goes well..  Opportunity Zones are part of President Donald Trump’s major tax cuts law from the end of 2017. They allow investors or for-profit companies to defer or reduce taxes on their capital gains. That money is made available for investments in economically distressed areas..  There are nearly 200 census tracts in Chicago and suburban Cook County that qualify as Opportunity Zones. But even before the pandemic there weren’t a lot of local projects . And there’s no oversight or tracking of projects on the local or federal levels..  The consortium is a partnership with lenders, foundations and government. Robin Schabes is the new executive director and sees the consortium’s function as more of a facilitator..  “Matchmaking,” Schabes said, “whether it’s a potential opportunity with a prospective investor, education is a big component of what we’re going to do.”.  By actively looking at sites in the eligible census tracts, the consortium hopes it can spur investment, create jobs and bring equitable development. It can connect community partners and developers with wealthy investors. A website highlights opportunities..  Across the country, Opportunity Zones have come under criticism for not being an economic tool that helps disinvested Black communities, especially. While there are compelling examples of community benefit, the program is not living up to its economic and community development goals, according to an Urban Institute report released last week..  Public sector money has been stretched thin with the current economic challenges brought on by the pandemic, said Robert Tucker of the Chicago Community Loan Fund. Opportunity Zones provide an opening..  “These are private funds that we really believe will be critical to supporting the communities and the businesses that are ultimately the heart and soul of the region. So we want to see deals get done,” Tucker said..  Natalie Moore is a reporter on WBEZ’s Race, Class and Communities desk. You can follow her on Twitter at @natalieymoore .

187,"(Bloomberg) -- The Chicago City Council approved Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s $11.65 billion budget for 2020 that raises fees on ridesharing services, refinances more than $1 billion of debt and merges departments to fill the biggest shortfall in recent history..  Lightfoot is closing an $838 million budget deficit. The spending plan’s reliance on some one-time moves, like debt restructuring, raised questions about how she will plug future shortfalls as pension costs are projected to rise..  “The 2020 budget is a progressive blueprint for the future,” Lightfoot said at City Hall after the vote on Tuesday. “We first look inwards and not to the taxpayers.”.  Chicago is struggling with rising costs and a shrinking population that has already been hit with higher property taxes and other increased levies in recent years. The city’s four pension plans are short about $30 billion, and the city’s mandated pension contributions are poised to ramp up. Chicago’s annual projected pension contribution climbs to $1.68 billion in 2020 and tops $2 billion by 2022, city documents show..  Lightfoot said that the 2020 spending plan has “no significant” property tax increases..  “Overall, this seems to be a reasonable plan to move the city forward,” said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, which analyzes government budgets. “It’s a budget that reflects the challenges of these times.”.  The 2020 spending plan includes about $40 million more revenue from higher fees on ride hailing services, particularly from single riders in downtown, a move that Uber Technologies Inc. has pushed back against. Next year’s budget counts on $210 million in savings from refinancing more than $1 billion in debt..  The city is taking all those savings in one year, rather than spreading it out over several years. This planned refunding that seeks to “realize disproportionate savings in the short-run” is “an unsustainable budgetary practice that should be avoided,” Matt Fabian, partner at Municipal Market Analytics, said in an emailed report..  Fabian also warned that Chicago’s task of balancing budgets in upcoming years, including 2021, may pose challenges..  “A failure to raise taxes now, while the local economy is reasonably strong, raises the risk of an eventual hike being proposed when growth is weaker or even negative: a very hard environment to present recurring budget solutions,” Fabian said in his report..  Lightfoot had to balance her budget more with cost cuts after she was unable to gain Illinois legislative support for a graduated real estate transfer tax, which was projected to yield about $50 million..  She lobbied lawmakers during the six-day legislative veto session in October and November to approve such a tax as well as lower the tax structure on a proposed Chicago casino to increase its appeal for potential operators. Neither initiative got approval. The mayor and city officials may advocate for both measures next year as Chicago needs to find more revenue to pay its future bills..

188,"To counteract that, census workers are sent to addresses where responses haven’t been received. In college communities, that usually happens in April..  But with many students leaving town early, they won’t be around when census-takers come to call..  One group of students that will be easier to count is those living on campus..  The instant loss of some 20,000-plus Illinois State University students is likely to cause financial pain to businesses in uptown Normal. DAVID PROEBER, THE PANTAGRAPH.  “Students living in on-campus housing are counted through their university as part of our Group Quarters Operation,” according to a statement from the U.S. Census Bureau..  Places such as nursing homes, group homes, halfway houses and prisons also are part of the Group Quarters Operation..  Harriett Steinbach, assistant director of ISU’s Center for Community Engagement and Service Learning, said the university already was planning to do electronic reporting of its approximately 6,500 students living in campus housing, so that is unaffected by the closing of residence halls..  The same is true at Illinois Wesleyan University, where 1,270 students live in IWU-approved housing for spring term, according to Kyle Griffith, IWU’s director of residential life..  “We will still be able to provide all necessary information to the U.S. Census Bureau without issue, regardless of whether students are physically on campus when we compile our count,” said Griffith..  The Census Bureau said that, under its residence criteria, “in most cases, students living away from home at school should be counted at school, even if they are temporarily elsewhere due to the COVID-19 pandemic.”.  Steinbach said the university has communicated through its parents’ newsletter that students should be counted at their college residence, not their home residence..  “We had a pretty comprehensive plan” to reach out to off-campus students to ensure they filled out the census form, she said. The effort was supposed to kick off Wednesday, once spring break and the election were over..  Julia Abbinante, an Illinois State University freshman in elementary education from Wheaton, packs her belongings Wednesday, March 18, 2020, at Watterson Towers in Normal. The mass exodus of ISU students in reaction to the coronavirus outbreak may slash Normal's population count in this year's census. DAVID PROEBER, THE PANTAGRAPH.  A big part of that effort was to share the importance of being counted, how it translates into dollars used for such things as public transportation, roads, mental health services, affordable housing and other initiatives..  “It can real matter for the town of Normal and fellow students,” said Steinbach..  “We’re going to regroup next week,” she said. “We can still do a lot of our social media campaigns … and some of our electronic platform communications.”.  For now, Steinbach is stuck with a roll of 2,500 stickers that say “Every Redbird counts,” numerous fact sheets and handouts plus a lot of Census Bureau “swag,” such as water bottles..  Among events that had been planned was a gathering on the Quad on April 1 where census workers and computer tablets would have been present to sign up people on the spot, she said..  Griffith said, “We cannot stress enough the importance of everyone being counted in the decennial census to ensure that the federal government accurately apportions resources and representation for our citizens.”.  Although the end of July was the target date for the Census Bureau to complete its data collection, the bureau said in a statement “that date can and will be adjusted if necessary as the situation evolves in order to achieve a complete and accurate count.”.  Hanson would like to see the process extended into September..  “Students will hopefully be back by then,” he said. Why it matters.  The census determines which states gain congressional seats and which lose them..  Costing as much as $15.6 billion, the once-a-decade census not only captures the United States at a given moment — in this case April 1, 2020, officially . But it is perhaps the only thing every U.S. household is legally required to participate in regardless of who lives there..  Counting some 330 million heads is the largest peacetime operation the federal government undertakes. The Census Bureau hires a half million workers, opens around 250 offices and mails out a multitude of forms in English and 12 other languages to more than 130 million households. J.

The honored guest participated in a panel discussion and provided the audience with key things that each and every attendee could do from wherever they were in life to contribute to better outcomes in business, community engagement, education, government and politics, healthcare and labor. A couple of the take-a-ways was the need for women to complete the 2020 census questionnaire and encourage their families and friends to do the same because it has funding implications across all of the categories of honorees..

The room illuminated with each woman exchanging crowns as a first time introduction and an expression of new sisterhood and support, or to acknowledge a continued support of someone familiar. The panel discussion engaged everyone in a unique occasion for Chicago area women leaders to connect in a totally supportive environment and share how everyone can help to support each other throughout their journey. Many spoke of the importance of positive communications, community involvement and engagement, encouraging voting and voter registration, advocating for 2020 Census participation for Illinois funding to match the need of each community, recalling the history of women leaders who sacrificed and persevered to create the path for all women to be where they are today..  The event included a live special artist painting, created on-site, by the talented Tyler Clark. The painting, depicting the spirit and intent of the event was raffled as a cherished prize. Uplifting and encouraging each other forward is the purpose and power of Black Girl Magic! 2020 and is encouraged to resonate throughout the year with Chicago women leaders and women around the world.

Clearly you've identified the real problem.This is why nobody believes you. And no one believes you because you use years-old pictures to illustrate assertions of things that just happened.If you take another look at the data, you'll see that-of course-the raw numbers of cook county infections, deaths, etc. are much higher than the rest of the state. The population of cook county is just over 40% of the entire state. Peoria county, on the other hand, accounts for 1.4% of the total population of illinois. The number of cases are TRENDING upwards. I think, if you actually paid attention to what's going on, you'd find that the urban centers were hit very hard much earlier because of sheer population density - it takes contact to spread the virus, and there is simply more of that in an urban environment. I think what you WILL find, after enough folks in smaller towns and semi-rural areas act like nothing is wrong, is that the virus will spread there as well. It will just take longer before those areas are hit hard by virtue of their lower population densities.Finally, anyone who actually says that the protests can't spread infections is incorrect. Of course they can. However, the folks who protested decided that showing the government how upset they were over the police brutalizing and killing citizens was more important in the short term. This article is about a bunch of people who decided that a PARTY was more important than fighting the spread of a virus.

198,"State Senator Scott Bennett (D-Champaign) encouraged Vermilion County residents to fill out the 2020 Census, protecting their representation in government and share of federal funding..  “The census is currently underway and is easy to complete with the new online questionnaire option. For a family of four, I was able to fill it out in a matter of minutes using a smartphone,” Bennett said. “Responding to the census is critically important because it determines funding for things like roads, hospitals, fire departments, and schools in Vermilion County.”.  In 2010, Vermilion County had a final response rate of 70.2%. So far this year, Vermilion’s response rate is down, currently only at 57.8%. More than half of the county’s residents’ responses have been submitted online..  “The census can be completed from the comfort of your own home and you can make your voice heard by participating,” Bennett said. “Now more than ever, it is vital that we ensure everyone is counted.”.  Although online is the quickest way to fill out the questionnaire, there are three ways you can respond: online, by phone or by mail. Bennett also pointed out that higher self-response rates mean fewer individuals are likely to receive visits from census surveyors to be counted in-person. This year, census surveyors are putting the health of themselves and their families at risk from COVID-19..  Original source can be found here .

199,"The coronavirus pandemic has slowed a lot of things, but not the census outreach efforts of a group of Chicago-area Catholics..  CLEVELAND — The coronavirus pandemic has slowed a lot of things, but not the census outreach efforts of a group of Chicago-area Catholics..  Through the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership, the census campaign has utilized social media, phone banks and creative means to urge the largely Hispanic community of Maywood, Illinois, to complete the census so that as many people as possible are counted..  “We are doing as much outreach as we can on a daily basis,” said Rose Okampo, a leader in the coalition, which roots its work in Catholic spirituality and theology in addressing pressing social concerns such as hunger, discrimination and environmental justice..  The coalition’s noncensus work has been funded by the Catholic Campaign for Human Development, the U.S. bishops’ domestic anti-poverty program..  Maria Franco, another coalition leader and religious education coordinator at St. Eulalia Church in Maywood, said the organization’s members felt education and action around the census was crucial to village residents..  Any significant undercount of people would mean the potential loss of millions of dollars in federal government assistance, she said..  “It’s important to remember that the census taking is not a one-time act,” she said. “This will affect our lives for the next 10 years.”.  The Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership estimates that an undercount of hundreds of people in the 2010 census resulted in the Chicago suburb of Maywood losing tens of millions of dollars for social services, infrastructure repairs, education and other important needs..  The campaign began last fall with education and outreach to residents. Much of the plan was based on one-on-one contact. Members of St. Eulalia Church, one of two churches that make up Sacred Heart and St. Eulalia Parish, got the backing of their pastor, Father Mike Arkins, a priest of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Census reminders also appear regularly in the church bulletin..  However, when the pandemic exploded in March, the coalition changed plans, utilizing phone banks staffed by volunteers, social media and creative outreach at limited locales, such as food pantries..  Okampo said pantries have become an important place for people who have lost their jobs because of stay-at-home orders and mandatory business closings. With more people visiting the pantries, the sites became a natural place to conduct census outreach, with social distancing in mind, she said..  “Pantries are one of the areas we pass out flyers in the bag. We go with music. We make people smile. We bring a microphone. People know the importance of being counted,” she told Catholic News Service ..  Before the shutdown, events such as a Census Family Day at St. Eulalia drew about 250 people, according to Megan Miller, a community organizer with the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership. Participants learned about the importance of completing the census and where to seek assistance if they had questions while socializing with their neighbors..  Since the shutdown, the coalition has turned to about 30 volunteers who have been calling people throughout the community reminding them to complete their census form. In a matter of weeks, the volunteers made 7,000 calls, Franco said..  Callers ask if the census has been completed; if not, they offer assistance or explain how the process takes perhaps 10 minutes and what it means to Maywood. For those who responded that they have completed the census, the volunteers offer a word of thanks and move down the call list..  For people who don’t answer their cellphones, a text message is sent..  “All we do is give them advice,” Okampo said..  One obstacle in Maywood, which has seen a large influx of Hispanics since 2010, is that some residents may not be legally in the U.S., Franco said, and they fear that completing the questionnaire will result in their arrest and ultimate deportation..  The volunteers try to calm such fears by explaining that the information being collected is not used by immigration enforcement officers..  “Nobody should be afraid to fill out the census,” Franco said. “That is something we have to take to heart.”.  Social media has played an important role in promoting participation in the census as well, Franco said. The coalition’s campaign has a Facebook page that includes regularly updated information. The page had reached 6,900 views as of May 1, according to the coalition. Other messages have been posted on Twitter and Instagram. Overall, the effort generated 42,000 views in April, Okampo said..  The campaign has been supplemented by videos and podcasts promoting census participation that have been posted on the coalition’s website at www.csplaction.org ..  Miller said the campaign regularly sees new volunteers stepping up to help with calls and flyer distribution..  The pandemic has delayed completion of census work from July 31 until Oct. 31. For Okampo and Franco, that means three extra months to reach people..  “We have a lot of work to do,” Franco said. “We’re definitely going to push it. We’re going to keep pushing it up until the very last day.” Share:","[0.5021396279335022, 0.4978604316711426]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5021396279335022

205,"For most of the last 30 years, any deposits made at the former Laramie State Bank — a striking Art Deco beauty in the Austin neighborhood — likely came in the form of plaster chunks falling to the floor. But city officials, through Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s much-touted $750 million Invest South/West plan, now want to improve the fortunes of the dilapidated 91-year-old Austin neighborhood building, and two South Side sites as well. The city’s Department of Planning and Development has issued a request for proposals for the three historically disinvested retail areas in hopes developers will step up with plans to provide “pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use projects that address local development needs while fostering additional investment on adjacent blocks.” But along with the sharp architectural renderings and hopeful language, an unspoken yet fundamental question is also on the table. Are Chicago’s leaders, financiers, developers and citizens finally committed to equitably rebuilding the South and West sides? Or are we content with having a glistening central core and North Side — much of it underwritten with billions of dollars in public subsidies — while streets and neighborhoods beyond Roosevelt Road and Ashland Avenue remain adrift in disinvestment and population loss? This is an effort worth watching. Because the success or failure of this venture, Invest South/West, is a referendum on the city’s future. ‘Comprehensive investment’ Unveiled last October , Invest South/West is a three-year program to uplift retail districts in 10 South and West Side neighborhoods, including Austin. “This is what a truly cross-sector, comprehensive investment plan for our South and West Side looks like,” Lightfoot said when announcing the effort last year. The three new RFPs — request for proposals — are the first issued under the program. In Austin, planning officials are looking for a development team to create a rehab and reuse plan for the vacant Laramie State Bank, 5200 W. Chicago Ave. The project would also include the redevelopment of five vacant parcels just west of the building. The city is willing to step in and acquire the property if a developer can’t come to terms with the landowner. Invest South/West has also targeted a site at 62nd and Green streets in Englewood. The plan calls for a mixed-use “town center” anchored by a 1929 brick and terra cotta fire station, a designated city landmark that was once home to the fire department’s Engine Co. 84, Truck 51. A mix of residential and commercial uses are foreseen. Then two miles south of Englewood in the Auburn Gresham area, city officials want to transform six vacant city-owned lots on 79th and Halsted streets into a new commercial building with residences on the upper floors. The site is across the street from the proposed Auburn Gresham Healthy Lifestyle Hub , a wellness and community center planned for a long-vacant former furniture store at 839 W. 79th St. If all goes well, the end result will be much-needed jobs, quality housing and new investment opportunities for all these neighborhoods. It will also provide a template for reinvesting and rebuilding the other seven Invest South/West neighborhoods. Taking care of all parts of the city Chicago — riven by COVID-19, neighborhood violence, and summer unrest unlike anything we’ve seen here in 50 years — must come to grips with a precious truth: we can no longer remain a metropolis so deeply divided by race and economics that two cities exist within the borders of one. So while the aims of Invest South/West might strike some as a kind of charity, in truth, this is balanced development; a city taking care of all parts of town rather than just the haunts of the privileged few. Is Invest South/West perfect? No. We’re still scratching our heads over how the initiative somehow excluded the faded, but historic, Madison and Pulaski retail intersection in the West Garfield Park neighborhood. And the city must also explain how it plans to make these investments while staring down a billion-dollar municipal budget deficit. It would be a terrible thing to hold out the promise of change on the South and West sides, then snatch it all back because the city is broke. If Chicago is going down this road, as it should, it had better finish what it starts. With that in mind, the responses by the developers to the RFP and whether any of this gets built at all is shaping up as an important test for Chicago and its future. A more equitable city If done correctly, Invest South/West, and efforts like it, have the potential to make Chicago a better and more equitable city than before. The due date for each RFP is Nov. 24, 2020. If the entities in charge of this city — the ones in and outside of government who make this place run — really care about Chicago, now is the time to be counted. Austin, Englewood and Auburn Gresham have gone far too long without the transformational redevelopment that neighborhoods like these sorely need. So much more work is needed. And hopefully, it’s now on its way. Send letters to .","[0.5109151601791382, 0.4890848696231842]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5109151601791382

The Central Management Services, which oversees the State’s more than 80 agencies, has an annual operating budget of $84.5 billion and is tasked with hiring the contractors and vendors that enable the state to take care of state business – delivering efficient, reliable services to the people of Illinois..  Sadly, very little of this annual budget and accompanying contracts are ever awarded to Black-owned businesses, even though Illinois’ Business Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and Persons with Disabilities Act (30 ILCS 575/) establish, as an aspirational goal, that not less than 20 percent of the total dollar amount of State contracts be awarded to businesses owned by minorities, females, and persons with disabilities..  The Illinois Black Chamber of Commerce (ILBCC) was created to help right such inequities. Our mission is simple. We exist to empower Black enterprises in order to strengthen Black communities..  Our goal is for all Black businesses in Illinois to become sustainable, high-growth enterprises by assisting with building their capacity to compete effectively for local, state, and federal commercial contracting. Crafting solutions that directly help reduce economic disparities that impact our communities is what the State Black Chamber does..  Recently, we joined forces with former employees of the Illinois Department of Transportation to demand an investigation of the recurrent and documented systemic racism at IDOT, which has a staggering budget of $23.4 billion this year. We’re working together to ensure that Black Americans get a fair chance to reap the benefits of the tax dollars they’ve paid into the Federal Highway Fund, with reference to internal and external hiring as well as subcontracting opportunities..  We’ve seen it time and again where state contracts created with the purpose of improving minority communities are not awarded to those most qualified to reach these audiences – entrepreneurs who look like us. Just take the U.S. Census Bureau. For the 2020 Census, a White-owned agency was awarded a whopping half-billion-dollar contract with the U.S. Census Bureau, even though the campaign was aimed at providing community outreach to underserved and hard-to-reach populations … in other words, Black and Brown folks. Multicultural agencies were brought on board as subcontractors, but even when we are awarded the contracts, the actual budgets allocated to do effective programming and place impactful ad buys with local and regional Black media is typically minuscule..  The disparity in State spending, across all industries, with Black-owned companies is unacceptable. We contend that things would have been much different if Black businesses had a seat at the table when that decision was being made. That’s why the ILBCC, its members, and 12 affiliate chambers and chapters are calling for a meeting with decision-makers in Springfield to discuss these issues..  In addition, the State of Illinois has a dismal track record of awarding contracts to Black-owned PR and advertising agencies whose work helps fuel Black media – newspapers, radio stations, magazines. Black media entrepreneurs like Tom Burrell of Burrell Communications, the late Earl Graves of Black Enterprise Magazine and John H. Johnson of Jet and Ebony, and countless others whose pioneering efforts made Black history also became centerpieces of American history..  Black media purveyors are the frontline communications platforms for the Black community, routinely providing and covering stories about what’s happening in and to Black America. According to Nielsen Ad Intel, advertisers invested $18 billion on Black American-focused media in 2018, which represents 21 percent of the total $83 billion spent on advertising. The State’s inability to do business with Black media and Black PR and advertising agencies is unacceptable. Again, we demand a seat at the table..  Because of nationally televised and undeniably graphic videos of Blacks being beaten and murdered across this country, millions of Americans have “awakened” to the pandemic of racism and inequality that Black people have endured for centuries. We now want to “wake” the State of Illinois to the economic as well as social injustices that Black businesses here experience each time they are denied the opportunity to contract with the State because they weren’t invited to have a seat at the table..  Black-owned businesses account for nearly 20 percent of all businesses in Illinois. Doing business with Black-owned businesses not only benefits business owners but when you hire and do business with Black-owned companies, you actually are investing in the broader Black community because Black businesses typically train and hire from within the community. This is economic development at its core, from the inside out..  The current social justice climate has ignited the flame for companies and brands across the country to step up and do more to ensure a more level playing field. Why should the state government be exempt from this clarion call?.  Our track record of successfully operating companies with multi-million dollar revenues should be proof enough to Governor J.B. Pritzker and the other powers in Springfield that Black-owned businesses are more than qualified and willing to handle their projects. We have earned our seats at the table!.

209,"This dissertation investigates rising poverty in suburbs in the Chicago-Joliet-Naperville metropolitan area in the 2000s. In that decade, suburbs saw an unprecedented rise in the number of poor and the reasons for this increase are not yet fully understood. Moreover, there are signs that this increase was not only the consequence of the decade's two recessions but of an on-going fundamental neighborhood change and shifting population compositions in metropolitan areas. In this dissertation, I use a combination of decomposition methods to identify the underlying racial, ethnic and socioeconomic dynamics for the increase in suburban poverty. Themes of this dissertation are drawn from urban geography and sociology, spatial demography, quantitative spatial analysis, and economic geography..  The first chapter introduces poverty trends in the U.S. and its consequences on an individual and local level. Furthermore, suburban change as well as racial and ethnic composition changes in metropolitan areas are discussed, culminating in the research framework..  Chapter two of the dissertation provides a comparison of four different suburb definitions. The comparison was conducted with data from the one hundred largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. using multivariate analysis of variance. The four methods were evaluated based on how well they capture the racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic variability between urban and suburban areas, and within suburban areas themselves..  Chapter three decomposes the local population change for four racial and ethnic cohorts and their socioeconomic status into the portion of change that is attributable to regional trends and to local factors in the Chicago-Joliet-Naperville metropolitan area during the 2000s..  Chapter four estimates the relative strength of the effect of a shifting population composition in suburbs, rising poverty rates among one or more groups, or a combination of these processes on suburban poverty in the Chicago-Joliet-Naperville metropolitan area using data from the 2000 census and 2008-2012 American Community Survey..  The results of the analyses show that much of the rise in suburban poverty is attributable to the economic effects of the Great Recession on minorities. Intra- and interregional migration of minorities has only a minor effect on suburban poverty. The results further show that nonpoor Whites leave inner-ring suburbs in large numbers, which exacerbates poverty rate increases..

211,"(CHICAGO) The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) reported 2,128 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday with 27 additional deaths.

(CHICAGO) The State Attorney General’s Office has joined a coalition of attorneys general and others in taking legal action against the federal government's latest attempt to impair the 2020 Census. Earlier this month, the Census Bureau announced it was reducing, by an entire month, from October 31 to September 30, the time in which self-response questionnaires will be accepted and door-to-door follow-ups by census enumerators will take place. In the brief, the coalition is calling for a preliminary stay or injunction to halt the ""Rush Plan"" because the shortened time will impair the accuracy of the count in each state, therefore affecting hundreds of billions of dollars of federal funding coming to each state as a result of the count. Other Midwestern states joining Illinois in the action are Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin..  (SPRINGFIELD) Secretary of State and State Librarian Jesse White has awarded almost $338,048 in Radio Information Service Grants (RIS) to support a group of radio stations whose mission is to ensure that residents of Illinois, who are unable to read standard print material due to a disability, have equal access to the information that is published in newspapers and magazines. Three of the four downstate recipients are college radio stations including those at Wabash Valley College in Mt. Carmel ($27,185), Lewis & Clark Community College in Godfrey ($17.438), and Southern Illinois University in Carbondale ($21,353). The other downstate recipient is MindsEye Radio in Belleville (51,777). The other recipients include those in Springfield, Champaign-Urbana, Macomb, DeKalb, Rock Island, and Chicago..  (SPRINGFIELD) The ongoing legal battle between Governor Pritzker and Illinois Sheriff’s Association over the transfer of county jail inmates to state prisons is continuing. While it all started back in March as the Governor placed a ban on inmate transfers in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 inside the state's prisons, a Logan County Judge a month ago today (August 3, 2020) struck down the ban, thereby clearing the way for around 2,000 inmates in county jails to be transferred to state prisons. However, a new ruling made two weeks ago today (August 20, 2020) put another stop to the transfers and as it stands now, any transfers are at the discretion of the State Department of Corrections due to health protocol. The ISA is concerned because of liability issues at each County Jail, not to mention the payment for food and health care on the local level with no compensation from the state. The ISA says the cost of taking care of these inmates should fall on the state, not the local taxpayers in each respective county..

212,"Illinois state universities face coronavirus fiscal fallout By Print Register now.  Illinois' public universities are grappling with the threat COVID-19 poses to state aid levels, enrollment, and already battered ratings while still recovering from the fiscal upheaval caused by the state’s two-and-a-half year budget impasse..  Many of the state schools lost their investment grade ratings during the budget stalemate that griped the state from 2015 to mid-2017, and now face uncertain prospects heading into the next school year. S&P expects reduced state appropriations, bringing financial performance implications for state universities in Illinois. wolterke - stock.adobe.com.  Gov. J.B. Pritzker has warned the proposed 2021 budget that would cover the fiscal year beginning July 1 requires a major rewrite due to the economic toll of the pandemic. The General Assembly has cancelled in-person sessions..  S&P Global Ratings' shift to a negative outlook on the state's BBB-minus rating, combined with concerns that state aid will take a hit, and the still weakened position of some of the universities led the agency to revise its outlook on the seven state universities it rates to negative from stable..  “In our opinion, for the rated public universities, the impact from weaker economic conditions could mean a material reduction in state funding and appropriations for higher education,” S&P wrote last week..  The state outlook change reflected the strains posed to the state’s tax base by the “stay at home order” in place that closed all non-essential businesses. Schools are also shuttered..  Illinois expects to receive about $2.7 billion from the $2 trillion stimulus/relief package approved in late March. It will help cover the costs of dealing with the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, but not the tax losses..  Illinois has not yet offered any estimates on tax losses, but a state legislative commission and university research group have warned that billions could be lost in state income and sale taxes depending on the severity of the recession..  “In previous times of fiscal stress, the state has delayed or reduced appropriations to universities, which we believe could occur again given our view of the onset of a global recession and the potential for budgetary stress at the state level,” S&P said..  The state's position, with lower reserve levels and elevated fixed costs from pensions, debt service, and retiree healthcare “makes it particularly vulnerable,"" S&P wrote. ""We believe that this will likely lead to reduced appropriations and financial performance implications for universities.”.  The state revenue pressures compound sectorwide struggles for higher education institutions, including the near-term loss of auxiliary revenues such as housing after campuses were vacated because of coronavirus concerns, and weakened operating results..  The picture remains murky going forward, because of the unknown duration of COVID-19 and potential declines in fall 2020 enrollments..  Illinois' regional universities face more risk as they’ve spent the last two years rebuilding their enrollment base, faculty, and reserves and rely most heavily on state support for operations..  “In addition, the declining investment performance and endowment market values, and weaker fundraising could also negatively affect ratings,” S&P warned. “These factors exacerbate pressures many of these schools already face, including a weakening demographic profile with a declining population of potential college applicants; significant outmigration of students to out-of-state institutions; and fairly thin balance sheet cushions to offset operating.”.  S&P rates the flagship University of Illinois and Illinois State University A-minus. That’s three notches above the state’s rating of BBB-minus..  “These universities have, in our opinion, demonstrated more robust demand profiles, larger endowments, and more manageable debt burdens, which all provide support to the ratings,” S&P said..  The other five are junk rated..  Southern Illinois University and Governors State University are rated BB-plus; Western Illinois University and Northeastern Illinois University are rated BB; Eastern Illinois University is rated BB-minus. S&P does not rate Northern Illinois University or Chicago State University..  Moody’s Investors Service rates the University of Illinois A1 and Illinois State Baa2. The remainder of those it rates are at a speculative grade: Southern and Northern Illinois at Ba2, Governors State at Ba3, Northeastern Illinois at B3, and Eastern Illinois at B1. All have a stable outlook. It does not rate Western Illinois or Chicago State..  The nine schools rely on the state for about 40% of their operating funds, although the percentage is lower for the flagship. The nine schools carry more than $2 billion in outstanding debt, with most issuing under two structures: certificates of participation and auxiliary revenue bonds..  The nine universities wrote last week to the state’s congressional delegation pleading their case for additional relief because they incurred costs of about $224 million with only $140 million covered by the last stimulus/relief package. They support the request made by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities that Congress provide an additional $47 billion in emergency funding for students and institutions of higher education..  “Over the past several weeks, we have taken unprecedented steps to safeguard the health, well-being and education of our students while maintaining our commitments to our employees and to the communities we serve. These measures have taken a significant financial toll,” the schools wrote.

Then, the coronavirus pandemic happened, and all their plans went out the window. Even though Ayala and her team had to scramble and rethink of ways to encourage residents to participate, she wanted them to know that the census – more than ever – is vital and if anything, is a peek into the future and how we can recover from issues like these..  Much of northern Illinois' response rate to the 2020 Census is above the state average, according to a statewide census response tracker which keeps tabs on percentage of households who have responded by state, county and city..  In the lead according to the most recent available data from April 13 is Kendall County at 63.7%, followed closely by McHenry County at 63.3%. Cook County lags among northern counties with a 48% response rate. Monroe County, with a population size according to the 2010 census of about 32,000, leads the state with a 64.6% response rate, while only 14% have responded in Hardin County, also in southern Illinois, home to just about 4,300 in 2010..  DeKalb County's response rate of 57% is also above the state average (53%), along with Lake County at 58%, Kane, Ogle, Will and Boone at 59%, Grundy at 56.6%, Stephenson at 57.%, Lee at 54.8% and Whiteside at 56.2%. Carroll County is lagging slightly behind the state average, at 52.5%..  Jason Blumenthal, management analyst with the City of DeKalb who's been helping census awareness efforts to ensure citywide services receive the funding they need from an accurate population count said the COVID-19 pandemic has everyone working on the census on edge..  ""I'll be honest, am I nervous? Yes, I am very nervous,"" Blumenthal said. ""I don't like the idea of all this panic and worry. But it's also provided the point of how services are determined by census bureaus. Hospitals will be able to use these numbers, and other government agencies, for federal funding."".  On Tuesday, the deadline for Illinoisans to participate in the 2020 census was extended to Oct. 31, according to an announcement from the U.S. Census Bureau, citing the COVID-19 outbreak, which has also caused field data collection to be temporarily suspended..  As of Tuesday, more than 70 million households in the country have responded, representing more than 48% of all households in America, according to the census bureau..  Sherrie Taylor, senior research specialist at Northern Illinois University’s Center for Governmental Studies and interim lead of the State Data Center Network in Illinois, said Illinois had already staffed their census offices fully prior to the COVID-19 crisis, and she isn't aware of any changes beyond the suspension of follow-up field collection..  ""I don't think any actions have been taken since nobody knows how this will play out,"" Taylor said. ""Illinois already met their needed hires before all of this started and while I'm sure there could be a few that have changed their minds, most are probably waiting to see."".  Assessing the nation’s population every decade is a U.S. constitutional mandate, and making sure everyone is counted, citizen or not, will ensure municipalities across the region have adequate funding and representation for the next decade..  Many grants are given out on a per capita basis, meaning they’re allotted based on population size, Blumenthal said. Health and human services grant funding for nonprofits, motor fuel and sales tax revenue, road repairs and transit program funding are just a few of the ways DeKalb County benefits from federal money that is disbursed per capita..  Illinois also is expected to lose at least one congressional seat because of a statewide population decline.  This is the first census to include digital response forms, and the push for virtual data collection means that door-to-door census workers wouldn't have been sent out into the field until May anyway. With a public health crisis, that in-person collection has been moved to the fall, reinvigorating a push for people to fill out their form online..  ""We're trending as a state above the middle of the pack,"" Blumenthal said..  Blumenthal said while the response rate numbers look promising so far, it's still a ways to go before a complete and accurate count of the county, and state, is done, and the pandemic has already pushed back deadlines..  ""This week, the paper-based forms should be appearing in mailboxes of those households that have yet to respond online,"" Taylor said. ""That will certainly help, especially in those areas that have limited Internet capability and will only receive the paper-based copy."".  Topping the entire state is Trout Valley, a community of 537 people in McHenry County, with a rate of 81.6%. The unincorporated community of Muddy, which has 78 people in Saline County, has completely ignored the census, having zero people respond. The median income of Trout Valley is $99,297, while the median income is $24,375 in Muddy..  Census forms can be completed online, by phone or by mail when your invitation arrives.

As of Tuesday, more than 70 million households in the country have responded, representing more than 48% of all households in America, according to the census bureau..  Sherrie Taylor, senior research specialist at Northern Illinois University’s Center for Governmental Studies and interim lead of the State Data Center Network in Illinois, said Illinois had already staffed their census offices fully prior to the COVID-19 crisis, and she isn't aware of any changes beyond the suspension of follow-up field collection..  ""I don't think any actions have been taken since nobody knows how this will play out,"" Taylor said. ""Illinois already met their needed hires before all of this started and while I'm sure there could be a few that have changed their minds, most are probably waiting to see."".  Assessing the nation’s population every decade is a U.S. constitutional mandate, and making sure everyone is counted, citizen or not, will ensure municipalities across the region have adequate funding and representation for the next decade..  Many grants are given out on a per capita basis, meaning they’re allotted based on population size, Blumenthal said. Health and human services grant funding for nonprofits, motor fuel and sales tax revenue, road repairs and transit program funding are just a few of the ways DeKalb County benefits from federal money that is disbursed per capita..  Illinois also is expected to lose at least one congressional seat because of a statewide population decline.  This is the first census to include digital response forms, and the push for virtual data collection means that door-to-door census workers wouldn't have been sent out into the field until May anyway. With a public health crisis, that in-person collection has been moved to the fall, reinvigorating a push for people to fill out their form online..  ""We're trending as a state above the middle of the pack,"" Blumenthal said..  Blumenthal said while the response rate numbers look promising so far, it's still a ways to go before a complete and accurate count of the county, and state, is done, and the pandemic has already pushed back deadlines..  ""This week, the paper-based forms should be appearing in mailboxes of those households that have yet to respond online,"" Taylor said. ""That will certainly help, especially in those areas that have limited Internet capability and will only receive the paper-based copy."".  Topping the entire state is Trout Valley, a community of 537 people in McHenry County, with a rate of 81.6%. The unincorporated community of Muddy, which has 78 people in Saline County, has completely ignored the census, having zero people respond. The median income of Trout Valley is $99,297, while the median income is $24,375 in Muddy..  Census forms can be completed online, by phone or by mail when your invitation arrives.

215,"A better solution, right now, would be for lawmakers to adopt an independent, citizen-led commission to draw legislative and congressional maps. Apr 15, 2020, 3:23pm CDT Ryan Tolley Flipboard The question of which political party in Illinois controls the legislative remapping process could come down to picking a name out of a replica of Abe Lincoln’s stovepipe hat. A plan being pushed by U.S. Census officials to delay sending population data to states until July 31, 2021, could give Republicans a shot at controlling the drawing of new legislative maps in Illinois. Whoa. What, you say? Yep, in what was shaping up to be a shoo-in for the Democratic-controlled Illinois Legislature to draw the maps in whichever fashion they would like, this move could completely undermine their control. There’s an important deadline in the Illinois Constitution, June 30. If state lawmakers don’t approve new maps — for congressional, state Senate and state House districts — by June 30 of next year, then the Legislature’s leaders must appoint an eight-person commission to take charge of the remap. That commission must be politically evenly split, made up of four Republicans and four Democrats. So if the Census Bureau doesn’t send Illinois the necessary population data until a full month later — July 31 of next year — state lawmakers will be denied an opportunity to even try to draw the maps. Also going out the window will be Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s chance to veto any map he deems unfair. But how, you might be wondering, could that appointed commission — four Democrats and four Republicans — ever manage to agree on one of the most highly partisan exercises in state government? Historically speaking, these commissions have not. Since 1970, when the current Illinois Constitution was ratified, three out of the four times when a back-up commission came into play, the commissioners had to resort to a tie-breaker process. Somebody had to reach into a replica of Abe Lincoln’s stovepipe hat (this being Illinois) and pick the name of somebody — equal chances a Democrat or Republican — to be the tie-breaker. The lucky tie-breaker’s political party then had unilateral control to gerrymander the map in any way they saw fit. There was no compromise. But what about the time, you might wonder, when the eight-person commission did not resort to picking a tie-breaker’s name out of a hat? What happened then? In that case, the legislative leaders appointed themselves and their staff to the commission that would draw the maps. This later was ruled to be unconstitutional — it made a farce of the very idea of an independent and bipartisan commission — but the 1972 elections went on as planned using an illegitimate map produced by this illegitimate commission. Then the newly elected lawmakers, having been voted in by an unconstitutional process, simply adopted that same exact map that got them elected. With Census officials asking for a delay, random selection or shenanigans could happen again in Illinois. A better solution would be for lawmakers to adopt an independent, citizen-led commission to draw legislative and congressional maps. This is not a new idea; other states have independent redistricting commissions and an effort has been underway to do the same in Illinois for many years now. The most recent proposal for Illinois has widespread bipartisan support in Springfield. Let’s drop the partisan games. If the remapping process stays the same, one side is going to lose — and it might not be the party everyone expects. Instead, our state could move to a remap process in which the people of Illinois win. Lawmakers have until May 3 to improve our state’s redistricting process. They can do so by calling the Fair Maps Amendment (HJRCA41/SJRCA18) for votes and supporting it’s independent process. If the Legislature fails to act, its leaders and the governor might want to starting brushing off that old Lincoln hat and collecting four-leaf clovers. If the Census Bureau succeeds in winning a delay, both Democrats and Republicans in Illinois will need a lot of luck if they hope to control the remapping process — and pick their voters — in 2021.

218,"Daily Bulletin: Chicago Is Spending More on Policing Than Ever — Despite an Overall Drop in Crime.  Receive this daily news briefing by email every morning. Sign up here..  WHAT TO KNOW TODAY.  NEW from THE TRACE: Police budgets used to be untouchable. The ‘defund’ movement is changing that. “Defund the police” was a rallying cry and a policy prescription long before the killing of George Floyd ignited protests in all 50 states. But as demonstrations continue into a third week, the once-obscure idea has gained support with the public and a number of city leaders. The Trace’s J. Brian Charles reports on how cities are approaching defunding, from dismantling departments in their entirety to freezing spending on law enforcement..  Chicago is spending more on policing than ever, despite an overall drop in crime. That’s according to the nonpartisan Injustice Watch , which calculated that the city funded the police at a rate of $215 per resident in 1964. This year, the city is spending $600 per resident, according to an analysis of census figures and police budget appropriations. That’s more than double what Miami-Dade County spends. Crime has steadily declined in Chicago since its peak in the ’90s. At the same time, homicide clearance rates have dropped. Activists and some city leaders have called on Mayor Lori Lightfoot to reduce the police budget, but she has declined..  Portland, Oregon, scraps a controversial police unit to combat gun crime. City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty has campaigned for the dissolution of the 35-officer Gun Violence Reduction Team for years, describing it as one of “the bureau’s most racially unjust units.” Mayor Ted Wheeler announced on Tuesday that the unit, which has a $4.8 million budget, would disband. Hardesty said she hopes the freed-up funds will go to Portland Street Response, an experimental program that utilizes community health workers to respond to non-emergency 911 calls..  Court denies qualified immunity to West Virginia police officers who shot Black man 22 times. A federal appeals court refused to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the family of Wayne Jones against the five officers who killed him in 2013. Jones, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, was stopped by police in Martinsburg for walking in the middle of the road. Officers tased, beat, and placed Jones in a chokehold. He was then shot as he lay on the ground. Jones had a knife tucked in his sleeve. Reversing a lower court decision, 4th Circuit Judge Henry Floyd invoked the police killings of both George Floyd and Michael Brown in his opinion : “Although we recognize that our police officers are often asked to make split-second decisions, we expect them to do so with respect for the dignity and worth of black lives.” The judge added : “This has got to stop.”.  NEW from THE TRACE: NRA put faith in attorney’s New York connections, court filing says. William A. Brewer III, hired in early 2018 as an outside counsel for the National Rifle Association, enjoys name recognition in the legal world. But does he have the clout to rein in the Attorney General of New York, who is investigating the group’s tax-exempt status? NRA boss Wayne LaPierre apparently thought so, according to recent court filings in which LaPierre is said to have touted Brewer’s “key relationships” in the state. Will Van Sant has the story ..  Coronavirus shutdown stalls restraining order reporting to New Orleans police. Lawyers and victim advocates tell The Lens that since the Louisiana governor implemented a stay-at-home order in late March, some protective orders haven’t been entered into the state protective order registry, which law enforcement relies upon. Those restraining orders often come with gun prohibitions. Earlier this month, The Trace and The Lens reported that New Orleans judges have been failing to order people under protective orders to relinquish their guns, despite a state law that requires them to be disarmed..  Seven people were shot at a Philadelphia apartment complex. One person was killed in the hail of gunfire shortly before midnight on Tuesday. Police said they found 45 shell casings at the scene. “It sounded like it was a gun battle back here,” a resident said. Police haven’t made any arrests..  DATA POINT.  The Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime has awarded $9.8 million for ongoing mental health care for students, families, employees, and first responders affected by the 2018 Parkland shooting. The funds will also reimburse Florida agencies that provided these services in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.","[0.5038551688194275, 0.4961448311805725]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5038551688194275
219,"Of the nearly 30 Illinois cities with populations over 50,000, only about one-third can claim more residents today than in 2010..  And many of those undergoing the largest population declines are cities that have long struggled to redefine themselves after the decline of their manufacturing and industrial bases — cities like Decatur, which is third in the nation in 10-year population loss, and Rockford, which is 15th, according to newly released U.S. census population estimates..  Decatur has shrunk by 7.1%, or nearly 5,400 people. Rockford is down 5%, or nearly 7,700 people..  Peoria’s population took a 4.1% hit in the past decade, dropping by 4,700 people..  During the past 10 years, Rockford — the city once known as the screw capital of the world and the second-largest city in Illinois outside Chicago — fell from the third-largest community to the fifth. Peoria is now No. 8 in the state, with Springfield at No. 6 despite a 2.4% decrease in population..  Experts say the reasons are varied. The decline of manufacturing means there are fewer jobs that can support a family, which leads to fewer and smaller families. A smaller job market forces young people to look elsewhere for opportunities. A beleaguered business climate, high tax rates, high crime and poorly performing schools — real or perceived — all play a role..  ""We are in a state where a number of conditions work against population retention,"" said Bob Evans, associate professor of economics and political science at Rockford University. ""And then there some of those conditions that impose themselves more brutally in certain areas."".  The decline of industry and the rise of technology have dealt a double whammy of sorts to some communities, Evans said..  ""For decades, employment in the U.S. has been shifting from industry to service,"" he said. ""Places like Rockford were caught in the middle of that — on the down slide of manufacturing jobs but not easily replacing those jobs with service jobs."".

Chicago’s population has remained relatively flat at about 2.7 million over the past 10 years, whereas Houston has gone from about 2.1 million people in 2010 to 2.3 million in 2019..  In the end, long-term population loss isn’t just a problem for cities like Decatur, Rockford and Peoria, experts say. It could negatively effect entire regions and the state..  According to the estimates, Illinois has about 160,000 fewer residents today compared to 2010, a 1.2% decline..  If those estimates hold true when the 2020 census is complete, it could mean a smaller voice in Washington, D.C. and fewer federal funds..  ""One of the biggest concerns is going to be what that means to the political representation and federal funding,"" said Brian Harger, a program coordinator with Northern Illinois University’s Illinois Health Information Technology Regional Extension Center..  ""We may lose one or two seats in Congress, which lowers our influence. Most state and federal aid programs are based on population. So fewer people could mean less funding."".  Programs that distribute funds based on census population data include everything from Medicaid and public housing to road construction..  While census estimates give the public an indication of how communities are changing, they are not used to determine congressional representation or the distribution of federal dollars. The country relies on the 10-year, often called the decennial census, to calculate those changes..  In the Rockford area, the Region 1 Planning Council is spearheading efforts to make sure as many people as possible participate in the 2020 count..  ""Most federal money comes into areas of the state based on population,"" said Mike Dunn Jr., executive director of Region 1. ""Once you lock in to that 10-year number, you now have basically determined your share of federal funding for health care, transportation, housing, public safety ...

221,"Chicago Has A $ 5 Million Coronavirus Fund For Residents And Undocumented Mayor Lori Lightfoot Says It Is For Those Excluded From The Act Known As CARES Eligible Residents Will Receive A One-Time Check Of $ 1,000.  The city of Chicago revealed on Wednesday a $ 5 million fund for residents who, according to Mayor Lori Lightfoot, were excluded from federal coronavirus relief legislation known as the CARES Act, including undocumented immigrants, according to information released by the AP..  Eligible residents will receive a one-time check of $ 1,000, Lightfoot said. The fund is a partnership between the city, the Open Society Foundations and The Resurrection Project, government officials headed by Lori Lightfoot said..  Authorities said the fund is expected to begin delivery this month. Those interested can request through the website of the Resurrection Project..  “The money the city of Chicago puts into our communities is made without regard to citizenship,” said Lori Lightfoot..  Lightfoot said the fund is also targeted at college students living in poverty and residents who recently left prison..  Lightfoot signed an executive order in April that said it will ensure that Chicago immigrants living in the country without legal permission receive all of the city’s benefits, opportunities and services, a rule it reiterated for an existing law..  As mayor, Lightfoot has strived to support immigrant communities, personally delivering “know your rights” flyers, last summer when President Donald Trump announced large-scale raids by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service ( ICE)..  But she has also faced criticism from activists who want her to do more, including redrafting the Cozy City Ordinance to eliminate certain gaps..  Just as Chicago announces aid for coronavirus to undocumented immigrants, in the first four days of the year it was announced that Denver will grant subsidies of up to $ 1,000 to those workers who lost their jobs due to the current pandemic and who, due to their immigration status, are not eligible for federal or state aid programs, reported Mayor Michael B. Hancock..  In a statement, Hancock said his office, in agreement with the city council, “will invest” $ 750,000 in a relief fund for those immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, who lost their jobs and no benefits as a result of Covid-19. ..  The local government estimates that, with sufficient donations, up to 17,000 people could benefit from the subsidies..  According to data from the Census Bureau, some 345,000 of the 727,000 inhabitants of Denver, the capital of Colorado, were born abroad, with 60% of immigrants from Latin America. In addition, 14% of all businesses in this city are run by immigrants..  “The individuals and families we will help with this fund work in the restaurants, hotels and venues of this city, and in many industries that feed our thriving economy and make our city what it is. They also deserve our support in these uncertain times, ”said Hancock..  “Contrary to what the federal government does, we will not abandon some of our friends, family, or neighbors. We will help them like all the members of our community ”, he added..  However, thousands of undocumented immigrants have refrained from asking for help with the coronavirus like the one announced by Chicago.","[0.5059260725975037, 0.49407389760017395]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5059260725975037

Jobs start at $26.50 per hour. By Lorraine Swanson, Patch Staff Dec 31, 2019 9:43 am CT {{ The U.S. Census Bureau has started recruiting census takers and field supervisors for 2020 Census count. (Shutterstock) CHICAGO, IL—The U.S. Census Bureau is recruiting thousands of people across the Chicagoland area to assist with the 2020 census count. A variety of temporary positions are available, including field supervisors, census takers (enumerators), and office staff..  Candidates must be 18 years or older, have a valid social security number and be a U.S. citizen. Census takers will be paid $26.50 per hour, field supervisors make $29.50. Veterans are especially encouraged to apply and will be given preference after proving military service. Interested applicants must complete an online job application . The application includes assessment questions about your education, work, and other experience. ( Read FAQs for information about pay, hours, etc.).

The Chicago Tribune headline today read , Illinois loses population for 6 th year in a row – and it lost more residents than any State this decade. The Purpose of This Post Is to relate an ancient wisdom analogy of “blowing in the wind” described by King Solomon to explain the reasons for the Illinois exodus. King Solomon Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life. (Proverb 13:12) The prospect of the righteous is joy, but the hopes of the wicked come to nothing. (Proverb 10:28) “She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.” (Proverb 3:18) The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and whoever captures souls is wise.” (Proverb 11:30) What’s My Point? News pundits will expound a host of reasons why Illinois is losing population. For example, taxes, debt, jobs, crime, violence, government leadership, wise or foolish voters, reduced legal or illegal immigration, etc. etc. While all above may contribute to the spiral whirlwind vortex exodus downward, the main reason is related to observations made 3000 years ago by King Slalom proverbs, in my opinion. History has recorded the rise and fall of numerous once vibrant communiites who prospered and grew, boomed and bust, or even became ghost towns because of various reasons. Some reasons economic, some reasons cultural in the sense that the people lost hope and stopped having children, the tree of life in every community. Without children to motivate families to grow, the community’s whirlwind in a downward spiral of population at a faster and faster rate same as what you will see if you spin a coin on a whirlwind. My point is to focus on what in my opinion has been the main reason why Illinois will in time, in spite of its central location in the Nation, continue to diminish over time. People will work in Chicago but choose not to live in Chicago or plant their trees of life, families. In other words, family neighborhoods will not bloom or flourish family trees of life again in Chicago or certain areas in Illinois. The core reason, as evidenced now, are the continued news of local parish churches and schools that taught family and religious values to residents have wilted away instead of continuing to flourish. Flourish with trees of life nourished by community wisdom, love, and hope that bind families and righteous behavior into thriving neighborhoods and communiites. In My Opinion One of the main reasons why people in time choose to remain in neighborhoods hope to grow their trees of life in communities is because of school choice. Chicago and Illinois was at one time a city of vibrant churches and private religious schools which united communites with various religious cultures. Private religious schools have become too costly for the average USA family to choose or afford to send children because if families cannot afford to pay tuition to both public and private schools. When the religious schools close down, families who can afford to, will choose to move to better school districts. School funding though is not the main reason. The main reason is the cultural exodus of teaching religious values which center on growing trees of life that are, and always will be the ultimate source of joy for every family. That is if the family understands the basics messages of religious values which is wisdom and love. King Solomon observed that understanding and knowledge lead to wisdom. Wisdom is understanding what brings lasting joy in life rather than fleeting pleasures fueled by vanity and blowing in the wind seeking treasures. Family is the ultimate and lasting joy in life for parents, grandparents, children, and community. However, too many people are not taught and nourished religious values that instill and promote wisdom and love as taught in the Bible and other religious cultures. Without wisdom and love, hope will diminish in time to grow family trees of life that produce joys and sorrows of life for families nourished by blessings of life from their Creator.

But in September, the Tribune reported that Illinois stood out in failing to attract new residents from other countries and states..

For our town to survive, we have to save these buildings and get this business back."".  Eldon formed in 1870 around a railroad depot. The economy grew when it became a stop for the Rock Island Company's route between Chicago and Los Angeles and a crew change station..  But it was after the Iowa-born Wood based the background of “American Gothic” on a white-framed house in Eldon that the town received international attention.

233,"Illinois state Rep. Avery Bourne (R-Raymond) recently took a stand for fair maps in Illinois while appearing on a WTIM morning show..  “In Illinois, legislative maps are drawn by politicians to benefit those who are in power,” Bourne was quoted as saying in a press release , describing the crusade as one of her top priorities. “We must change it so that voters get to pick their representatives and districts are drawn fairly. Gov. J.B. Pritzker ran on supporting fair maps, but he has yet to call on the legislature to pass it.”.  Critics of the current system contend that it has gotten so bad that lawmakers are now able to pick their voters as opposed to the other way around. They point to the fact that in 2018 almost half of all House and Senate seats combined that were up for reelection found incumbents running unopposed . Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.  “Now is the time to make this important policy change before the 2020 census and another decade of gerrymandered, partisan legislative districts,” Bourne said..  Currently, Illinois is one of 35 states that grants lawmakers the power to redraw their own legislative districts, essentially safeguarding their seats against would-be challengers. As a candidate, Pritzker vowed to change the system..  “We should amend the constitution to create an independent commission to draw legislative maps, and I have supported this effort for years,” Pritzker wrote in a candidate profile months before his election to office Four years earlier, CHANGE Illinois reports that Pritzker donated $50,000 to a fair-maps initiative..  Legislative maps are now drawn every decade in Illinois and require the approval of both the House and the Senate before being signed off on by the governor. In the event there is a stalemate, party leadership is entrusted with appointing an eight-member committee in hopes of resolving the issue. If need be, the Secretary of State appoints a tie-breaking ninth partisan by random chance, with the winning party left to draw the map as representatives see fit.

Photo by Jennifer Pedley, “Picture 1000 Words Media”.  NAPERVILLE, Illinois (RNS) — Community Christian Church’s annual Christmas pageant includes all the classics..  There’s “O Little Town of Bethlehem” and “Away in a Manger.”.  And everyone's favorite sing-a-long: “I Want to Hold Your Hand.”.  The church's annual “ Let Ringo ” sets Beatles..  It mixes Scripture, songs and dance into what Community calls a.  And it's Anna Bramlett's “favorite annual tradition.”.  Bramlett, a 15-year-old sophomore at Naperville North High School, plays Mary in this year’s production. It's her 10th appearance in the show, now going on 12 years at the nondenominational church,.  The show is a family affair for Bramlett. Her father and uncle wrote the show and appear as prophets and wise men in colorful, psychedelic Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band uniforms. Her mom casts the show each year. And her cousins and older siblings also have appeared in it..  The production by the church’s Epic Theatre Company also features about 85 performers from across the Chicago area and sells out shows throughout the month of December. This year, there are nine shows running through Dec. 21 at the Naperville church. “Let It Be Christmas: The Gospel According to Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, George and Ringo” at Community Christian Church in Naperville, Illinois. Photo by Jennifer Pedley, “Picture 1000 Words Media”.  “It's definitely a whole different arena than what I think a lot of families think of as spending time together,"" Bramlett said. ""I personally love it. I think it's so much fun, seeing what my family is able to create and be a part of every Christmas season."".  “It's also definitely different, thinking of the Beatles as Christmas music.”.  The idea for “Let It Be Christmas” came from a sermon series years ago at Granger Community Church in Granger, Indiana, that tied one song from the Fab Four to one part of the Christmas story each Sunday, according to director Elic Bramlett, Anna's uncle. It ended with a small pageant set to five Beatles songs on Christmas Eve..  After seeing Mary and Joseph singing Beatle John Lennon’s song “Beautiful Boy” to baby Jesus, Elic Bramlett had a feeling..  With permission from the Indiana church, he and two other writers stretched the pageant into a full rock opera. The show continues to grow each year, getting better all the time with additional characters and songs..  “These songs just fall in my lap and just work for the show. I'm pretty proud of the fact that we don't change any lyrics,"" Elic Bramlett said..  In this year’s production of “Let It Be Christmas,” a character dubbed The Engineer largely narrates the show, along with The Carpenter and The Blackbird — the show’s depiction of the Trinity.

In the beginning is “The Word,"" a tune from the Beatles' ""Rubber Soul"" album: ""Spread the word and you'll be free."".  Then Mary and Joe promise to be true to a string of the band’s early love songs, including “From Me to You,”“All My Loving” and “Love Me Do.” A manger scene during Community Christian Church’s annual “Let It Be Christmas: The Gospel According to Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, George and Ringo” in Naperville, Illinois. Photo by Jennifer Pedley, “Picture 1000 Words Media”.  An angel then appears to Mary and tells her she will be mother to the son of God, Jesus. She responds in a dance with The Blackbird and the words of the familiar song, ""You were only waiting for this moment to arise.”.  It’s all too much for Joe, who struggles with the news of Mary’s pregnancy, even though she assures him in song, “We can work it out.”.  Later, he’s so tired he collapses into a dream in which an angel tells him to take Mary as his wife. “You have found her,"" the ensemble urges him, ""now go and get her."".  All together now, the couple travels to Bethlehem to be counted in a census — cue the opening riff of “Taxman”— and baby Jesus is born. And, yes, the shepherds and wise men find themselves going to a party, party with the Holy Family..  “I think Christmas is kind of one of those universally enjoyed things — like the Beatles are,” Elic Bramlett said. “You don't have to be a huge ’60s and ’70s rock 'n' roll fan to appreciate the Beatles, and you don't even necessarily have to be a Christian to appreciate Christmas.”.  Anna Bramlett said it's ""a trip"" to play the role of Mary, something that seemed so far away when she was a member of the ensemble..  At first, she focused on learning her lines and her blocking. Later, she started thinking about what goes on in Mary's mind when an angel tells her that her child will be the savior of the world..  “All Mary had to do was say yes to God and all of this happened, and the story is still being told in 2019,” she said.

235,"Illinois is still dealing with a recession hangover due to a mix of mortgage-friendly laws, high property taxes, and population declines, per a new analysis. Q4 of 2019 marks 10 years since the low-point of the national housing crisis. Nearly one in four mortgaged homes had negative equity, meaning the market value of the property is worth less than the value owed in mortgage. Today, the nation’s homes have largely emerged from years of being underwater, with property analytics firm CoreLogic showing less than four percent of homes with mortgages still in negative equity. “There’s been a great deal of improvement,” CoreLogic chief economist Frank Nothaft said. In the 12 months ending in September, they estimate homes across the country saw their homes value increase by 5.1 percent. Homeowners in Idaho saw the nation’s largest increase of 10.9 percent, gaining $25,800 in equity on average. Illinois, however, saw a fraction of those gains, nearly equal to inflation. “Home equity was up nearly only an average of $1,300 for your typical homeowner in Illinois,” Nothaft said. “The negative equity share still remains high, almost twice what it is nationwide.” The problems are familiar to Illinois residents: lax income growth and population loss coupled with some of the highest property taxes in the nation driving demand and prices down, Nothaft said. One novel problem, Nothaft said, is that Illinois’ laws regarding repossession of a home through foreclosure are some of the longest in the nation. “Illinois has been one of the states with the longest timelines between the initiation of a foreclosure proceeding and the resolution of that proceeding,” he said. The laws effectively extend the timeline of when a home can be placed back on the market and sold, returning it to the property tax pool. One law passed in 2009 extended the time that a home could be forcibly vacated from 90 days to 120 days. Another bill contained a whole host of changes that placed requirements on the foreclosing entity to complete before they could repossess a home, facing fines and court costs for breaching the red tape. This extended process at a macro level, Nothaft said, meant the recession essentially lasted longer in Illinois than in other states. “The homes may even remain vacant for an extended period of time before the foreclosure is resolved,” he said. ###","[0.5808936357498169, 0.4191063940525055]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5808936357498169
236,"Chicago Republican Party Chairman Chris Cleveland has seen this play out too many times before..  “In Illinois, city government is like the neighborhood mobsters you see in the movies,” Cleveland told Chicago City Wire . “For every transaction you see, they want a cut out of it.”.  Cleveland’s latest example is the way he sees the city muscling in to triple the tax on Uber and Lyft rides in downtown Chicago as of Jan. 1. With the start of the New Year, the tax on such solo rides in a special “downtown zone” will balloon from 72 cents to $3 between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. weekdays. Chicago Republican Party Chairman Chris Cleveland.  Outside the downtown Chicago area, the tax on solo rides will increase to $1.25. Overall, the city projects the added taxes will generate up to $40 million annually..  “When you tax something too much, you get less of it and this means more people will be using private cars,"" Cleveland said. ""Does the mayor really want this?”.  Indeed, that would defeat one of the primary purposes Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has offered for imposing the tax, which is to alleviate mass congestion in the downtown Chicago area..  “This will only increase traffic because more people will now be using their private vehicles,” Cleveland countered..  In the end, Cleveland argues that Democrats pushing the added taxes are missing out on one key consideration..  “Democrats don’t understand that people aren’t required to be here in Illinois, and when taxes get too high they’ll leave,” Cleveland said.

238,"Indian Americans in Chicago protest against CAA, say “law discriminates against religious minority group” July 1, 2020 TCN News Indian diaspora in USA’s Chicago has recently come out on streets to show support to Indian Muslims over the passage of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that was passed in the Parliament in December 2019. The US which has already been witnessing #BlackLivesMatter movement over the murder of George Floyd, saw Indians marching on the streets of Chicago against the CAA, resonating that it “discriminates against the religious minority group.” Other supporting groups that are protesting are Indian American Muslim Council, Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago, Northwestern University’s South Asia Solidarity Group, University of Chicago as well as other human rights activists and local student groups. Bodhi Vani, a student at the University of Chicago, said that it was important for Indians in Chicago to voice their protests against such oppressive measures. She discussed that Indians in the US had also taken out a rally against CAA at the Indian consulate on January 26, adding that due to COVID-19 lockdown, the momentum that was slowed down has been picked up again due to the efforts of human rights groups that organized this campaign. Support TwoCircles The organizers have said that while the country fights against racial discrimination it must also join the fight against all kinds of discrimination and the CAA in India is nothing but “the ruling BJP – Modi’s Hindu nationalist party, acting on its anti-Muslim agenda.” Anuranjan Sethi from the Northwestern University’s South Asia Solidarity Group expressed that it was not just a conflict between Hindus and Muslims but about “fighting against a certain kind of a government and its arrogance in pushing its prejudices on to the public.” Hence, it added, “it is important to condemn the discrimination itself and also to speak categorically against discriminatory laws.” He further said that it is significant that the Indian student community must show active pursuit of anti-discrimination laws as “they mirrored the diversity of opinions in their home country.” According to the 2010 United States Census, there are more than 242,000 South Asian Americans in Chicago, with Indian Americans making up the largest subgroup of Asian Americans in Illinois. Junaid Ahmed, President of the Chicago branch of Indian American Muslim Council, who has been a resident of the US since he was 13 years old, lauded the amiable relations between Indian Hindu and Muslim communities in the US. He said that many Hindus in Chicago had come out in solidarity with the Muslims. Ahmed added that “the religious schism started five or six years ago,” and although many non-Indian organizations joined the protest, some groups used it to sow anti-Muslim sentiments. Bodhi Vani, the student protestor said that “it is important to spread awareness about the developments in India,” because “the world is not reacting with appropriate condemnation to what is happening in India.” She added that the only way one can change the discrimination that is happening in India “is by disseminating information.”","[0.711432158946991, 0.2885678708553314]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.711432158946991

240,"Economists have forecast that employers added 3 million jobs in June and that the unemployment rate dropped to 12.3% from 13.3% in May, according to data provider FactSet. If they’re correct, the job gain would top the surprise increase of 2.5 million in May , which was a record. But it would also mean that Americans have still recovered just one-quarter of the jobs they lost in March and April , when states engineered widespread shutdowns of restaurants, bars, stores, hotels movie theaters and other retail establishments. In short, the jobs report is more important than ever but in some ways harder to read. Here are five things to look for when the report is released: Will the government count everyone correctly? The three most recent jobs reports have been bedeviled by a unique problem created by the coronavirus: Millions of Americans are being counted as employed when they should be classified as temporarily out of work and therefore unemployed. The government counts the number of unemployed through a monthly survey. Since March, its survey-takers have been classifying many Americans as employed even if their employers are closed because of the pandemic. In many cases, these people believe they still have jobs. But the Labor Department says that if they aren't working, they should be considered temporarily unemployed. In May, 4.9 million people were counted as working when they should have been counted as unemployed. Had these people been properly classified, the unemployment rate would have been reported as 16.4%, not 13.3%. Even accounting for the misclassification, unemployment is still declining, if only slowly. In April, if the same adjustment had been made, the jobless rate would have been 19.5% instead of 14.7% How many layoffs are permanent? Another unique aspect of the coronavirus recession is that many more laid-off workers than usual consider their job losses to be only temporary and expect to return to their old employers. That's not surprising. Many restaurants, shops and gyms had expected to be closed for only a brief period to combat the pandemic before reopening for good. And indeed, as states began reopening, many people were called back to their old jobs. In May, even among people who were still out of work, roughly three-quarters regarded their job losses as temporary. Applying for unemployment benefits for the first time? Here are 7 things you need to know. » But with many consumers still reluctant to dine out, travel, shop or congregate in groups, more business closures are becoming permanent. In May, the number of people who said their jobs were gone for good rose nearly 300,000 from April. If that figure keeps growing as the pandemic surges back, the job market and the economy would take longer to recover. Advertisement Do job gains show racial inequality? Did the unemployment gap between whites and African Americans widen? Since the recession began in February, i t has struck Black and Hispanic Americans harder than the overall U.S. population. According to a Census Bureau survey, 53% of Black households and nearly three-fifths of Latino households have lost income since the viral outbreak struck. Breaking News Newsletter As it happens Get updates on the coronavirus pandemic and other news as it happens with our breaking email alerts You are now following this newsletter. See all newsletters. But the job losses aren't reversing at the same pace for everyone. While the unemployment rate for white Americans fell by 2 percentage points in May to 12.4%, it rose slightly for Black workers, to 16.8%. Unemployment for Latinos also fell but was still higher than for all other groups, at 17.6%. Will state and local governments shed more jobs? In May, even as most large U.S. industries added jobs, state and local governments cut 550,000 workers, after having slashed 950,000 in April. The job losses have raised concerns that even as the economy slowly recovers, faltering sales tax and income tax revenues will force state and local governments to keep cutting jobs. That would damage the recovery. In fact, most economists say that widespread state and local government layoffs weakened the recovery from the 2008-2009 Great Recession. Congress is debating whether to provide further aid to avoid such cuts. Will more Americans stop looking for work? Millions of Americans still have jobs but have been reduced to working part time rather than full time, leaving them with less money to spend and thereby slowing economic growth. In May, more than 10 million part-time workers would have preferred full-time work — more than double the number in February, before the virus struck. And many of those who've lost jobs haven't looked for new ones. That's either because they are discouraged by high unemployment or they fear being infected by the virus. People who don't search for new jobs aren't counted as unemployed.

241," How students in Chicago Public Schools make their voices heard Student voice committees have tackled issues ranging from school-uniforms to not having mirrors or enough toilet paper in bathroom By: Matt Zalaznick | June 29, 2020 Chicago Public Schools' student voice committees teach students how to bring about change by forming productive partnerships with the adults in schools..  Before Chicago Public Schools steeped itself in student voice, educators there realized their young learners had far more influence on their lives outside the classroom..  It was the students themselves who began advocating for bigger roles in the wide range of decisions made in their school buildings, says Cristina Salgado , the district’s senior student voice specialist..  As a result, the district launched student voice committees at 16 high schools about six years ago. There are now almost 200 of the committees spanning high school to the elementary level, Salgado says..  The committees have tackled issues ranging from school-uniforms to not having mirrors or enough toilet paper in bathrooms..  More from DA : How educators can be part of dismantling systemic racism.  “It wasn’t that students hated uniforms but buying khaki pants was an extra expense and the pants got dirty and some students didn’t have washing machines,” Salgado says. “The adults began to understand it wasn’t just kids complaining.” Giving all students voice.  Educators recruiting for the committees seek out more than just students who are naturally inclined to participate in school activities, she says..  “It’s not enough to go to teachers and ask them to nominate someone because what ends up happening is the ‘best’ students get nominated,” Salgado says. “We have to do our due diligence to make sure we are creating committees that are representative of all students.”.  That means seeking out quiet students and those who have fallen behind academically or who may be seen as troublemakers..  Assembling diverse committees is one reason the district offers “Student Voice 101” training to help the adult advisors who work with the committees understand how to empower young people and encourage students to get involved in various forms of activism..  “Some students may be the ones who show up to protests, others are the types who work at nonprofits or are policymakers,” she says. Outcomes of youth activism.  Teaching students as young as fifth grade the process of organizing around a cause, building civic leadership skills and learning how to forge partnerships with adults is as important as what the activism achieves, Salgado says. Educators who mentor Chicago Public Schools’ students voice committees hope student voice will become a factor in all district decisions..  “For me, it’s not always about the end product, it’s about what students learn along the way,” she says. “The more they build positive student-adult partnerships, the more we will see change because adults will begin to practice not making rash decisions and pausing to ask what students think about an issue.”.  Students involved in the committees have become more active in causes in their communities and have also gotten their classmates involved in local issues, such as the census. These students have also provided feedback on online learning that has taken place during coronavirus closures..  “Our next level of engagement is to invite school leaders to think through the systems and structures they’re creating in their schools that could include and prioritize student voice,” she says.

242,"Commentary: Ald. Raymond Lopez: Mayor, if you don’t have a plan, I do By Raymond A. Lopez Chicago Tribune | Jun 12, 2020 | 4:53 PM Various groups protest at City Hall for the enactment of a Civilian Police Accountability Council in 2016. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Chicago needs a plan. By now the entire nation has seen and heard how Mayor Lori Lightfoot not only failed to have a plan to protect Chicago’s 77 communities, but also steadfastly refused to listen to my concerns and my colleagues'. Advertisement The real story is not about profanity. It is not about who taped what and who leaked it. The real and unforgivable story is that Lightfoot failed our city for failing to create a plan to protect Chicago and its people. So let’s go back to the original question that started it all: Mayor, what’s the plan? While she waits for her out-of-state advisers to respond, I offer this plan for recovery to heal our city as one. Advertisement First and foremost, we cannot allow the true reason for the demonstrators to get lost amid the chaos: the murder of George Floyd and the unanswered goal of police accountability. Chicago has two ordinances addressing civilian oversight: One would create a Civilian Police Accountability Council (CPAC) and one proposed by the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA). Both have community support. Both have languished in City Council for years. We need to take the hard vote now on true police accountability. We must restore people’s faith in law enforcement by removing the bad apples and showcasing the thousands of good officers that report to duty every day. Second, Chicago can no longer ignore the racial inequities that have been roadblocks to success for black Chicagoans. After the 1960s riots, it wasn’t until the last five years that investments really returned to the long-ignored West Side. We cannot again allow decades to go by before taking action. The South and West sides of Chicago, home to predominantly African Americans, cannot be left without a targeted and expansive effort to help lift them up firmly in the middle class. I propose tweaking Lightfoot’s Invest South/West initiative to encompass existing businesses, helping them stay in the communities they served before the devastation related to the looting. If they are excluded, this program will hasten the gentrification of the neighborhoods it is meant to serve. Third, Chicago must take the lead in demonstrating its true commitment to inclusion and reform by having its internal hiring and department contracting goals match the demographics of our city. In 2010, African Americans accounted for 33% of our population, yet Chicago’s contract diversity participation goals for all minorities is only 26%. That policy forces African Americans, Latinos and others to needlessly fight against each other. Chicago must immediately change this policy, striving for goals that reflect the ethnic/racial demographics of this city as determined by the U.S. census. Based on 2010 data, that means an African American participation goal of 33%. These goals should also be updated every 10 years based on those numbers. Fourth, Chicago must open bars, restaurants and businesses quickly, fairly and equitably. While Lightfoot has embraced my idea of expedited sidewalk cafe permits, there is much more we can and must do to ensure businesses outside of downtown can also participate in the economic reopening of the city. Along with issuing permits faster, let’s be creative, linking food trucks and taverns to allow both to open quickly. We must waive fees and allow businesses without prior complaints to self-report inspections in order to open more quickly. Chicago must cut the red tape and bring relief to our local small business owners.

See all newsletters. Fifth, there are 12,000 vacant city-owned lots across Chicago in both residential and commercial areas. We need a comprehensive land-use policy determining what best use of these properties should be. Let’s allow acquisition of vacant lots by their resident neighbors. Let’s build affordable housing. Let’s create retail storefront pop-up or shared spaces? Most importantly, let’s put these lots back on the tax rolls. Lastly, a complete independent forensic audit of Chicago’s revenues and budget is required to determine the economic impact the devastation caused by the pre-pandemic real estate downturn, the coronavirus pandemic and now the recent assault on our city. We must be honest with the people of Chicago about the state of our city’s finances. Politicians make lots of promises often without thinking how to pay for them. There are many great ideas here and elsewhere that can get Chicago back on track, but they will remain only ideas if we cannot pay for them.

243,"6/13/2020 by David M. Dismore.  Today in Feminist History is our daily recap of the major milestones and minor advancements that shaped women’s history in the U.S.—from suffrage to Shirley Chisholm and beyond. These posts were written by, and are presented in homage to, our late staff historian and archivist, David Dismore . June 13, 1913: There’s a festive atmosphere here tonight at the Leland Hotel in Springfield, Illinois, where suffragists from all around the State are celebrating the first major victory for women’s suffrage East of the Mississippi River. PHOTO: A recent cartoon in the Chicago Tribune by John D. McCutcheon showing woman suffrage triumphantly crossing the Mississippi River.  Day before yesterday, the Illinois Legislature gave final approval to a bill that when signed by the Governor will allow women to vote in Presidential and municipal elections..  Though anti-suffragists have asked Governor Dunne to veto the bill, the fact that he is here tonight, and just gave a stirring speech of congratulations would indicate that only the legal formalities of engrossing the bill and getting a favorable opinion of its constitutionality from the State Attorney General remain before Dunne’s signature makes the bill a law, and women can begin registering to vote..  Illinois women will still not be able to vote for State offices, such as Governor, because the State Legislature does not have the power to grant them that right. Totally equal suffrage would have required waging and winning an expensive, time-consuming and very risky campaign for a Statewide referendum to be approved—or rejected—by the State’s male voters. But this unique extension of “presidential suffrage” and “municipal suffrage” represents a double victory for our movement..  Currently, women vote in States West of the Mississippi that have 54 of the 531 Electoral Votes cast in Presidential elections. Illinois will soon bring that total to 83, meaning that women could tip the balance in the 1916 election if it’s close..  Chicago will soon have the honor of being the largest U.S. city in which women can vote. Its population of 2,185,283 is five times larger than San Francisco’s, and only slightly less than the entire State of California, which counted 2,377,549 residents in the 1910 Census..  Many Chicago suffragists already have plans for the post-suffrage era. There will be major campaigns mounted against two notorious Aldermen, “Bathhouse John” Coughlin and “Hinky Dink” Michael Kenna. Tom Powers of the 18th Ward should also be worried about the women’s vote..  Another top priority will be to support the “Half Holiday Bill” already introduced into the State Legislature. It would require employers to give employees Saturday afternoons off. Many about-to-be enfranchised women will also lobby for a bill reducing the standard workweek to just 54 hours..  Suffragists in some other parts of the country have been engaging in high profile campaigns and huge spectacles, such as massive parades and pageants in Washington, D.C., on March 3, and New York City on May 3. But the Illinois campaign was virtually invisible, and consisted of local suffragists informally lobbying individual State legislators. This latest four-month campaign—after a 43-year struggle in the State—was done so quietly that it didn’t attract the attention of anti-suffragists until it was too late to launch a counter-offensive using the vast monetary resources generously donated to them by the liquor industry, which fears that woman suffrage will bring Prohibition..  Tonight’s victory banquet is giving what should be a glimpse of the future. Big-name politicians from all over the state came in person to show their support for the cause, as well as curry favor with women voters. Many well-known people from around the country sent telegrams of congratulations, some of which were read aloud..  All of those who orchestrated this surprise win are here tonight. Grace Wilbur Trout presided over the festivities, and many others such as Ella B. Stewart, Antoinette Funk, Elizabeth K. Booth and Catherine Waugh McCullough either gave speeches or were singled out for praise..  This is truly a new era for the suffrage movement, because as significant as the Illinois victory is, it’s only one encouraging development among many. Not since 1909 has a year passed without at least one new State being gained for suffrage, and last November full and equal suffrage was won in three States—Kansas, Arizona and Oregon—and was lost in Michigan by only 760 votes..  In New York, a suffrage referendum was approved by the State Legislature in January, and if the bill gets the required second passage by the next legislature as well, the Empire State could become the first full-suffrage State in the East in 1915. At the opposite end of the continent, women in Alaska Territory won full suffrage in March..  In Washington, D.C., today, the Senate Woman Suffrage Committee gave a strongly favorable endorsement of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment when it sent the resolution to the full Senate, where it will be debated next week..  So, more and more, the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle are fitting together, and whether woman suffrage is accomplished by winning it in each of the 48 States, or by a Constitutional amendment, the only questions now are over “when” and “how,” not “if” victory will be won..  The coronavirus pandemic and the response by federal, state and local authorities is fast-moving . During this time, Ms . is keeping a focus on aspects of the crisis—especially as it impacts women and their families—often not reported by mainstream media.

248,"Genna Reed | February 11, 2020 Exposure to Air Pollution from Vehicles in Illinois Is Inequitable — It Doesn’t Have to Be David Reichmuth , Senior vehicles engineer | February 19, 2020, 3:56 pm EST.  Cars, trucks, and buses are a significant source of air pollution in Illinois . But how much pollution is attributable to these vehicles and who is exposed to it?.  To help answer these questions, I’ve used a computer model to estimate the amount of fine particulate matter air pollution (known as PM 2.5 ) created by using on-road vehicles (cars, trucks, and buses). While air pollution from vehicles affects everyone in Illinois, the findings show that people of color on average are exposed to higher levels of harmful particulate matter air pollution. Asian Americans, African Americans, and Latinos are exposed to PM 2.5 pollution 32, 21, and 19 percent higher, respectively, than the state average. At the same time, whites are on average exposed to 13 percent less PM 2.5 pollution than the state average. In addition, the over 5 million people living in Cook County, including Chicago, experience air pollution from transportation that is among the worst in the nation. What is PM 2.5 and why is it important?.  Exposure to PM 2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) is linked to increased illness and death, primarily from heart and lung diseases. These particles are small—20 times smaller than the diameter of fine human hair—so they can penetrate deeply into the lungs; the smallest particles can even enter into the bloodstream. While not the only air pollutant that adversely affects health, PM 2.5 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 95 percent of the global public health impacts from air pollution . Long-term exposure to PM 2.5 causes increased death rates attributed to cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, and it has been linked to lung cancer, miscarriages, mental health problems , and other adverse impacts. Chronic exposure to PM 2.5 in children has also been linked to slowed lung-function growth and the development of asthma , among other negative health impacts..  On-road vehicles like cars, trucks, and buses are a significant source of harmful emissions in Illinois. Tailpipe emissions caused by burning gasoline and diesel are a source of climate-changing emissions such as carbon dioxide and also compounds that directly and indirectly lead to airborne particulate matter. In addition, vapors from gasoline refueling and vehicles’ fuel systems add compounds to the atmosphere that are transformed into further particulate matter pollution. Greater PM 2.5 pollution for African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos.  We estimated exposure to particulate matter air pollution using a recently developed model from the University of Washington and data from the US Census Bureau . The model lets us calculate how vehicle tailpipe and refueling emissions ultimately lead to exposure to ground-level particulate matter pollution so we can understand how exposure to PM 2.5 varies among racial groups and where people live..  The results are clear: the burden of PM 2.5 pollution from cars, trucks, and buses is inequitable when looking at the exposure experienced by racial groups in Illinois. As noted, Latinos are, on average, exposed to 19 percent higher PM 2.5 concentrations than the average Illinois resident. African Americans experience concentrations 21 percent higher than average. Those identifying as Asian Americans have the highest average exposure, over 30 percent higher. White residents in Illinois have average exposure that is 13 percent lower than the average for the state..  It’s important to note that these results pertain to exposure to PM 2.5 from on-road transportation, which accounts for only a portion of exposure to air pollution. Other sources of exposure include industrial facilities, electricity generation, aviation, and rail. These, too, can have a disproportionate impact on communities of color..  Asian Americans, African American, and Latino residents of Illinois are exposed to higher than average levels of particulate matter pollution from cars, trucks, and buses. Exposure by racial group is based on US Census race and ethnicity data from the American Community Survey . Exposure for the Latino or Hispanic category reflects all respondents that chose either Latino or Hispanic Origin . Data are not shown for racial groups that are less than 5 percent of statewide population due to model and analysis limitations..  PM 2.5 Exposure from Cars, Trucks, and Buses Varies Greatly Within Illinois PM2.5 pollution from on-road transportation is highest in Chicago and surrounding Cook County . The darkest shading on the map indicates areas that are in the most-polluted 20 percent of census tracts..  Exposure to PM 2.5 pollution from cars, trucks, and buses varies greatly within Illinois. Concentrations are highest in urban areas and downwind of those areas; Chicago and its immediate surroundings are affected the most..  Cook County, including Chicago, not only has the state’s highest PM 2.5 pollution exposure, but it also is one of the nation’s worst affected counties . Air pollution from on-road vehicles is a problem in major cities across the US. The average exposure for Cook County is 90 percent higher (or nearly double) the average for the continental United States (the data exclude Alaska and Hawaii). Given the health impacts of PM 2.5 pollution, the 41 percent of state residents that live in Cook County shoulder a significantly larger burden from on-road vehicles than the average American..  Cook County is Among the Metropolitan Counties with the Highest Exposure to On-Road Pollution Rank","[0.5019655823707581, 0.49803435802459717]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5019655823707581
249,"https://ift.tt/328LSdu.  (Bloomberg) — Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker raised the stakes in his push for higher taxes on the wealthy, promising more dollars for education, public safety and pensions in his 2021 budget proposal if voters approve a constitutional amendment to enact a graduated income levy..  The billionaire Democrat delivered his second budget address Wednesday. Spending is forecast at $42 billion for the year that starts July 1, while general fund revenue is projected at $42.1 billion, budget documents show. The revenue estimate includes $1.4 billion if a graduated income tax is approved and will be in reserve until voters sign off on the tax structure..  “Last year we began turning our ship of state in the right direction,” Pritzker said during the speech in Springfield, the state capital. “The budget I propose to you today will build on the steady progress we’ve been making over the last year.”.  New revenue is needed in Illinois amid $7.3 billion of unpaid bills and $137 billion of unfunded pension liabilities, a drag on the state’s credit rating. If voters sign off on a constitutional amendment that shifts Illinois from a flat to a graduated income tax, the higher levies on those earning more than $250,000 is forecast to bring in $3.6 billion annually in the first full year, according to estimates from Pritzker’s administration..  Pension Funding.  In his 2021 budget, Pritzker plans to fully fund the state’s certified pension contribution of $8.6 billion. If the graduated income tax goes through, an additional $100 million would go to pay down the state’s pension costs, he said..  “Next year would be the first year in state history that we will make a pension payment over and above what is required in statute,” Pritzker said..  The state would also put that additional revenue from the income levy toward spending on education, health services and public safety, he said. Some of that additional spending is contingent on the new revenue though..  “We cannot responsibly spend for these priorities until we know with certainty what the state’s revenue picture will be,” Pritzker said..  Even without the passage of the new tax structure, state revenue in fiscal year 2021 is projected to get a boost from higher collections of income taxes and $46 million from adult-use recreational cannabis sales, which was legalized on Jan. 1, budget documents show.About $10 million of the tax revenue from cannabis will go toward the bill backlog, which on Dec. 31 was about $7 billion, down from $7.9 billion a year earlier, according to the state..  “The foundation of this budget is not on solid footing,” Illinois Senate Republican Leader Bill Brady said in an interview after Pritzker’s speech. The governor is basing at least part of the revenue projections on a tax rate increase that voters haven’t signed off on, said Brady, who doesn’t support the higher levy..  “I think that’s the wrong way to go about it,” he said. “If voters choose not to go that direction, it leaves a hole in his budget. Therefore, we are worried and concerned.”.  Given the vote is still months away and the outcome is unknown, working through the budgetary process will be a “delicate dance,” said Representative Mike Zalewski, who heads the Illinois House Revenue Committee..  Illinois House Republican Leader Jim Durkin said higher taxes aren’t needed. He cited the recent improvements in the state’s finances, higher revenue already coming in, economic growth and low unemployment..  Infrastructure Spending.  Pritzker’s budget priorities also include reforming Illinois’s criminal justice system. His administration started a six-year $45 billion Rebuild Illinois infrastructure program in fiscal 2020. Pritzker wants to improve the competitiveness of Illinois, which has seen its population decrease in recent years, he said..  The state’s gambling expansion could also be a source of revenue for the state and its municipalities in future years. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot was in Springfield on Tuesday advocating for a change in tax structure for a potential Chicago casino..  Pritzker said his office is working with Chicago and lawmakers “to make a much needed adjustment in the legislation passed last spring to help make sure the Chicago casino is a success that will help fund projects throughout our state.”.  Investors have applauded Pritzker’s steps to improve the state’s finances, and want action taken on the pension debt. Illinois bond yields have fallen relative to benchmark securities, in part because of the state’s fiscal progress..  “The future improvements in the state credit will continue to depend upon increasing pension funding, improving the balance sheet and finding more sources of taxes,” Dan Solender, head of municipal debt at Lord, Abbett & Co., which manages $28 billion in the securities, said in an email after Pritzker’s speech. “Overall, he said a lot of the right things” such as paying down bills and funding the state’s pension system “but now he needs to follow through,” he said..

252,"Authored by Ted Dabrowski and John Klingner via Wirepoints.org,.  If you’re wondering how widespread Illinois’ problems really are, check out the below chart based on U.S. Census data. It shows that 93 of the state’s 103 counties have shrunk since 2010. Illinois’ population has dropped by 170,000 people since the turn of the decade and few of the state’s counties have been spared..  Illinois has lost more population than any other state in the country and it was one of just four states to shrink since 2010. The other three states were West Virginia, Connecticut and Vermont. By comparison, states like Indiana added 200,000 to its population, while fast growing states like Tennessee and South Carolina added more than 400,000 each. Florida, Texas and California have added millions to their populations since 2010..  Illinois’ population loss across so many counties is a reflection of the state’s outlier status on many of the nation’s economic, demographic and financial metrics. Illinois has the nation’s most costly pension crisis , one of the highest tax burdens , falling real home prices and a general lack of economic opportunity. It’s also one of the most corrupt states in the country..  Cook County lost the most population of any county in Illinois over the 2010-2018 period. The county lost nearly 19,000 people. Winnebago was second with a loss of 11,000. St. Clair was third with a population drop of 9,300..  Macon, Peoria, Madison, Vermilion, LaSalle, Rock Island, and Kankakee counties rounded out the top ten biggest losers of population..  At the other end, only nine of the state’s 102 counties managed to gain population over the period. Kane County grew by 18,000, largely offsetting Cook County’s losses. Another collar county, Will, gained 13,500. Kendall County was next with an increase of 12,500..  The only other counties to show growth were DuPage, Champaign, McLean, Monroe, Grundy, Williamson – just nine counties in all. The downstate problem.  Collectively, Illinois’ downstate counties have suffered the worst loss of population, by far. The whole region lost nearly 120,000 people between 2010 and 2018 – more than 2.5 percent of its total population..  Three (DuPage, Will and Kane) of the five collar counties gained population, leaving the collar counties as the only growth area in Illinois..  However, that increase was largely at the expense of Cook County. Previous migration data shows many new collar residents come from Cook County..  Cook County itself lost 19,000, or 0.4 percent, of its total population over the 2010-2018. That’s on top of the more than 200,000 people it lost in the decade prior to that..  A 0.4 percent loss may not sound like much, but compared to the nation’s largest counties, Cook County is an outlier. Wirepoints analyzed the population change for the nation’s 50 most populous counties and found that Cook was one of just seven counties to lose population since 2010..  Think whatever you want about Illinois politics, but it’s being categorically rejected year after year by far too many residents..  Until the state’s policies are flipped on their head – until Illinoisans finally get the big pension and spending reforms the state desperately needs – expect many more to uproot their lives to find opportunities elsewhere..

Cook County itself lost 19,000, or 0.4 percent, of its total population over the 2010-2018. That’s on top of the more than 200,000 people it lost in the decade prior to that..  A 0.4 percent loss may not sound like much, but compared to the nation’s largest counties, Cook County is an outlier. Wirepoints analyzed the population change for the nation’s 50 most populous counties and found that Cook was one of just seven counties to lose population since 2010..  Think whatever you want about Illinois politics, but it’s being categorically rejected year after year by far too many residents..  Until the state’s policies are flipped on their head – until Illinoisans finally get the big pension and spending reforms the state desperately needs – expect many more to uproot their lives to find opportunities elsewhere..

256,"IFI tries to connect Illinois out-migration to a potential repeal of parental notification laws.  Friday, Jan 10, 2020.  * This Illinois Family Institute article shows us once again that people who constantly complain about out-migration will always try to blame it on their Number 1 issue. Upset about government pensions? That’s why people are leaving! Cranky about taxes? That’s why people are leaving! Despise the Democrats? That’s why people are leaving! Hate the winter weather? That’s why people are leaving! ….  According to a recent article in Forbes magazine, Illinois has the disconcerting distinction of being the top state for out migration. That is, Illinoisans are leaving the state in record numbers. This is not a new trend. For 6 years in a row, Illinois has had a net population loss..  Is there a connection to our high taxes, political corruption, pension debt, radical abortion expansion, LGBT indoctrination and many other foolish policies? We believe there is, and a recent abortion-related law may be partly to blame..  When state lawmakers passed SB 25 and Governor JB Pritzker signed it into law, they opened the door to ending what little protection there is for young girls, a protection we fought long and hard for: Parental Notification of Abortion..

Thursday, September 24 at 2 PM on abc7chicago.com. The hour-long town hall will be moderated by ABC 7 Eyewitness News Anchor Rob Elgas.Chicago's Black and brown historically undercounted communities have been hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has impacted people in these communities in unique ways, which is why an accurate Census count will help determine the type of resources specifically needed to address the numerous disparities. In some communities that might mean more resources for local hospitals, while in others it might mean more workforce development programs, or an expansion of afterschool programs.Rob Elgas will lead a conversation on why an accurate Census count is so critical in pinpointing what resources will go where. Along with representatives of Chicago's Latino community who are doing the heavy lifting, Elgas will explore how they are innovating their services to educate, assist and make sure Latinos are counted.Panelists include:- Juan Soto, Executive Director, Gamaliel of Metro Chicago- Licinio Garcia, Development Coordinator, Latino Policy Forum- Ruben D.

267,"Watch Live: Jacob Blake's Family Holds March in Kenosha.  Hollingsworth said he has always been an animal lover and that horses changed his life, also announcing plans to create a stable in Chicago for more children to have a similar experience..  Hollingsworth was charged with one count of aggravated animal cruelty , a class 4 felony, on Tuesday, related to the Dan Ryan ride, according to a statement from Illinois State Police. If convicted, he faces between one and six years in prison on the charge. In a bond hearing Wednesday, a judge ordered him held on a $25,000 bond, which he met for his release..  He said Thursday that he could have done ""a little bit less"" regarding the horse ride down the highway, but that he needed to make a statement..  Officials say Hollingsworth rode his horse onto the Dan Ryan Expressway just after 4 p.m. Monday, conducting a Facebook Live broadcast while on the highway, shouting “kids lives matter” as he rode the horse along the expressway. He was flanked by numerous motorcycles and other vehicles, and traffic was backed up as a result of the incident. The man dubbed the ""Census Cowboy"" took his horse down Chicago's Dan Ryan Expressway Monday afternoon during rush hour..  In preparation of his horse ride, Hollingsworth said he called the Illinois State Police to warn them, but never received a call back..  On Monday morning, Hollingsworth told his son, ""daddy might be getting locked up today,"" to prepare him for the outcome of his protest, according to his press conference..  Authorities said he was previously charged with misdemeanors including reckless conduct, disobeying a police officer, criminal trespass to state-supported property, obstruction of traffic, and operating a non-highway-vehicle on a highway in connection with the incident on Monday afternoon..  The horse suffered a bloody wound on one of its hooves and appeared to have sores on its sides from the saddled, officials said. It placed in the custody of Chicago Animal Care and Control..  Prosecutors on Wednesday said the horse, later transferred to the care of a stable, is in critical condition and may have to be euthanized as a result of its injuries..  Hollingsworth called on Mayor Lori Lightfoot to support him after he assisted her in pushing the census movement this year, along with asking support from Kanye West and Chance the Rapper.

269,"Illinois will begin the first of two housing relief programs on Monday that will provide nearly $300 million to renters and homeowners who’ve lost income and are at risk of losing their housing because of the coronavirus pandemic..  The relief comes in the form of grants distributed by the Illinois Housing Development Authority, with applications for renters in need opening on Monday, said Kristin Faust, the development authority’s executive director..  “This is an opportunity to help stabilize people, to help keep renters in their apartments,” she said. “Help keep everyone at home, which is what we’re supposed to be doing at this time of COVID anyway.”.  Applications for mortgage assistance will launch in late September, according tothe authority..  The state divided funding evenly between rental and mortgage assistance, with each program receiving around $150 million to distribute. The authority will be able to help around 30,000 renters with grants up to $5,000 and 10,000 homeowners with grants up to $15,000, Faust said..  “We think $5,000 will really help cover rent for most of March through December because a lot of people have been able to make some partial rent payments, but it’s going to be different for each person,” she said..  Faust explained the aid is for people who had been paying their rent or mortgage consistently through February before the pandemic restrictions hit..  “Really what caused you to get behind is a COVID-caused loss of income,” Faust said..  The rental grants are limited to households with income up to 80% of the area median income as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau. For the Metro East, that’s a household income of $66,300. The housing authority determines eligibility as the first step to apply for assistance..  Applications also require a tenant’s landlord to provide information for it to be accepted, Faust added. Once applications close on Aug. 21, the authority will select grantees through a lottery process like other assistance programs in the country , she said..  “We’re going to randomize them and give everyone a fair chance,” Faust said. “And then select the top 30,000 and process those applications.”.  There are other safeguards to ensure funding is distributed to residents across the state, not just the Chicago area, Faust said..  Nearly $80 million of the $300 million was earmarked by the Illinois General Assembly specifically for counties that did not receive direct allotments from the federal coronavirus relief fund. Those counties and cities in the state have populations smaller than 500,000..  Another$100 million of the original funding will go to communities that were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 cases for emergency rental and mortgage assistance, Faust added..  She said this assistance program is one of the largest in the country and will serve as many as 40,000 Illinois households..  “These are significant and unprecedented dollars that are coming through to help communities,” said Regina Greer, chief impact officer of the United Way of Greater St. Louis..  But these funds alone will likely not be enough to meet the need for rental and mortgage assistance in the state and the Metro East, she said. Many households on the Missouri side of the river also face challenges with meeting rent or mortgage payments, Greer added..  “We are seeing locally some of the same trends that nationally most communities if not all are experiencing around increased requests for basic needs that center around rental, utility, mortgage assistance,” she said..  Across the St. Louis region, more people have been requesting assistance, especially for housing, shelter, food and utilities, based on the number of calls United Way’s 2-1-1 help line is getting, Greer said. The organization has already received three-quarters of the call volume it received last year in only seven months, she said..  “Typically, need always outpaces the resources that are available,” Greer said..  Around 10% of Illinois households and 9% of those in Missouri report they have no or slight confidence in their ability to cover rent or mortgage payments for August, according to the most recent Census Household Pulse Survey , conducted July 16-21..  The survey has been collecting responses since late April to track and understand the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 on American households. Based on these survey results and current estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau , nearly 700,000 households across both states could face challenges to paying rent this month..  “This pandemic has crossed the borders of every demographic that you can think of,” Greer said..  Illinois and St. Louis currently have eviction bans in place, but those are only set to last until Aug. 22 in Illinois and Sept. 1 in Missouri. After they expire, some housing advocates fear a wave of evictions ..  “If there were mass evictions, then we’re talking about a crisis on top of a pandemic, and no one wants to see that,” Greer said..  She emphasized support also needs to come from organizations and people outside of governments to help ensure the highest number of people can be helped..  “This is a time where community needs to help community, above and beyond what may be coming through state, local and federal government,” Greer said..

271,"URBANA, Ill. (WCIA) — Over two million Illinois residents rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for food assistance according to May totals from Illinois Department of Human Services. That number increased 14.4% from January as the effects of COVID-19 impacted the financial stability and food security of individuals and households across the state..  To help Illinois residents and families meet their basic food needs, the University of Illinois Extension is launching a new Illinois community food map in early August that allows individuals to search by Illinois zip code for all food resources in that area..  “Our map takes a whole community approach, mapping all helpful food resources, not only food pantries and summer meal sites,” says Caitlin Kownacki, SNAP-Ed Extension specialist with Illinois Nutrition Education Programs ..  Residents who count on SNAP (or LINK) and other nutrition assistance programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children , typically search multiple, specific websites to find the resources they need..  The new Illinois community food map combines all resources in one geolocation mapping tool, making it particularly convenient for those with limited access to transportation..  In addition to locating food pantries and school and summer meal sites, households seeking food support will be able to search specific areas for the nearest grocery stores, food retailers, farmers markets, and roadside farm stands that accept SNAP (LINK), WIC, or senior food benefits..  Illinois SNAP and WIC offices, where individuals can sign up to receive benefits, are included in search results as well..  While this resource aims to help all Illinois residents looking for food assistance, Kownacki believes it will be especially valuable for single parents, single-head-of-household families, and households with children..  In 2018 an American Community Survey Brief by the U.S. Census Bureau reported 31.6% of national households participating in SNAP were single-head-of-household families, and 50.9% of SNAP households in Illinois have children under the age of 18.

272,"By BGA Oct 16, 2020 3:00 PM.  Every 10 years, Americans engage in an exercise meant to promote fair representation in Congress and our state legislatures. Redistricting is the act of drawing new legislative maps, adjusting boundaries to accommodate population shifts documented by the U.S. Census. Its purpose: To protect the value of your vote..  In Illinois, though, redistricting is controlled by politicians, whose priorities are incumbent protection and partisan advantage. The result? Broken communities, misshapen districts, elections that attract only one candidate because the outcome is already determined..  The completion of the 2020 census begins a process that will shape the maps for the next decade..  The Better Government Association and other good government advocates have campaigned for years for a constitutional amendment that would assign redistricting to an independent panel that puts voters first. That effort has been stymied by yes, the politicians..  So the BGA commissioned its own Illinois maps using estimated 2019 population figures and drawn according to principles of nonpartisan redistricting. This project explains what we learned — some of it predictable, some not. (For a deeper look at how we did it, see the About This Project page .).  Keep in mind that these are not the only maps that could have been drawn by applying the same principles. Public input — an important step in fair redistricting, but one we omitted here — can help shape district boundaries as citizens weigh in on how the maps might affect their communities. The BGA maps are a simulation, not a proposal for 2021..  To get started: Familiarize yourself with the maps below. Use the dropdown to switch between Congress, the Illinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate. Type an address into the search bar to locate it on the map, or simply click on a location. On the left, you'll see the current district, drawn by state lawmakers in 2011; on the right, the district on our map. Zoom in and out for a closer look. Compare and contrast the BGA maps with those drawn in 2011. Then read on. Loading...","[0.6610202789306641, 0.3389798104763031]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6610202789306641
273," President Trump is threatening to issue Census 2020 counts for redistricting that exclude undocumented immigrants. How will this play out for Illinois?.  Democrats hold all Chicago-area U.S. House seats. If undocumented not counted in the census, the democratic districts grow geographically..  As Democrat districts get larger in land area, more Republicans land in Democrat districts and those districts become more competitive. This may seem to help Republicans in the next election..  But the wildcard is that the Democrats will control mapmaking in 2021 after Illinois received the new census counts..  It seems likely that more Republicans will find themselves in a Democrat-dominated district in Illinois..

Illinois’ population during the past decade peaked at 12.9 million — in 2011 and 2015. It now sits at 12.65 million..

277,"Three weeks..  That’s the amount of time left for Illinoisans to be counted in the 2020 Census. Data collection ends Sept. 30, and predictably officials are worried..  At a conference Thursday to boost the case, Gov. JB Pritzker announced Illinois was sixth among states in terms of response rate, but said many communities are between 30% and 50% counted..  “These areas include some of our most marginalized and hard-to-count communities,” he later tweeted. “Places like the Austin and Little Village neighborhoods in Chicago, Dixmoor and Harvey in suburban Cook County, and parts of the Metro East and Central and Southern Illinois.”.  I filled out my form online shortly after the window opened several months ago, and have seen Census workers patrolling the neighborhood. I tend to think the bureaucratic hand-wringing is overblown, but an email from Chicagoan Bill McGraw, who regularly visits rural relatives, caught my eye:.  “I wonder out loud about the (newspaper) tackling the census issue and the need to count everybody for the sake of bringing home the tax money that is rightfully due the area. I know in Chicago where I have lived for over 50 years, that issue is front and center and thought about the rural areas where the need is great to have a solid count for the farmers and surrounding areas..  “Just a thought as my relatives — in their 90s now and managing their farms with sharecroppers — the need is greater as the next generations of both locals and immigrants continue the legacy of this great area of Illinois and the census tract is more important than ever given the aging population of local farmers and merchants servicing the wonderful counties in Central Illinois.”.  Taking Bill’s concern to heart, it seems fitting to remind all readers what’s at stake. Once all 50 states are counted, 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives will be apportioned, as will electoral college delegates. The average number of constituents per House member has climbed every decade, from about 34,000 after the 1790 census to more than 700,000 following 2010. It’s more than doubled since just 1950, when the average was about 334,000..  In June 2019 the Population Reference Bureau projected Illinois will lose one seat, along with Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. (Gainers are Arizona, Colorado, Florida, North Carolina and Oregon, adding one each, while Texas adds two.) If Illinois is undercounted, there’s a chance we could lose two..  The other pressing factor is federal aid allotted by population; U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Chicago, says each missed person costs the state up to $20,000 over a decade..  Get counted.

279,"ST. LOUIS – A new report estimates it would cost $440 million dollars nationwide to test every nursing home resident and staff member just once. The American Health Care Association (AHCA) says that amount would be for nearly 3 million tests..  The AHCA says the cost of ongoing COVID testing for nursing home residents and staff is unsustainable without additional funding and support from federal and state governments..  The association has asked the Health and Human Services Department to grant $10 billion in emergency relief to help fund testing and help with staffing needs..  The report breaks down the cost by state and looks at the number of facilities and residents per state. The figures are also determined with an estimated cost of a test at $150..  The association looked at census data and says Missouri has 522 facilities and estimates it would cost $12,390,300 to test the 38,202 nursing home residents and staff in the state..  The report also shows Illinois has 722 facilities and would need $21,441,150 to test the 142,941 residents and staff at the state’s facilities..  Illinois has increased its response to long-term facilities by sending more staff. There is a page dedicated to information about nursing home outbreaks on the state health department page.

283,"Da Tech Guy Blog 'Donald trump on DaTechGuy's reporting ""…It's nonsense nobody reports that, but you do that's why I like you"" Illinois corruption investigation breaks wide open with guilty plea of state senator for bribery over red-light cameras and more.  By John Ruberry.  Last Sunday in this space I wrote about the need to ban red-light cameras in Illinois –and nationwide. One of the reasons I gave was that the easy cash collected from these “safety devices” fosters corruption. Oh, as far as safety, I mentioned in that post that the record on safety involving red-light cameras is at best mixed. They may even cause automobile accidents..  On Tuesday former Illinois state senator Martin Sandoval (D-Chicago), who has close ties to longtime state House speaker Michael Madigan–who also is the chairman of the state Democratic Party–pleaded guilty to bribery, tax evasion, and extortion charges in federal court. Sandoval is now cooperating with the feds..  Sandoval is the former chairman of the senate Transportation Committee. Using the clout from that post, he promised to “go balls to the walls for anything you ask me” to a representative of the red-light camera firm referred to as “Company A” in the plea agreement..  So far that company has not been officially named but perhaps in a verbal misstep, told a judge, “I accepted money in exchange for the use of my office as a state senator to help SafeSpeed, or Company A.”.  SafeSpeed denies wrongdoing and in a statement says it is cooperating with federal authorities..  Politicians are nervous. This weekend on his Fox Chicago show Flannery Fired Up, host Mike Flannery said, “This red light camera company–suddenly candidates, Republicans and Democrats in Springfield and elsewhere are racing to get rid of this money as if it was infected with the coronavirus. ”.  Prosecutors say that Sandoval accepted $250,000 in bribes, including $70,000 in bribes to benefit the red-light camera industry..  It hardly seems that the industry needs the help. According to the Illinois Policy Institute, Illinois drivers have handed over $1.1 billion to municipalities in fines involving red-light camera infractions . Illinois’ largest city of course is Chicago so it won’t shock you that it has more red-light cameras than any American municipality. Chicago, as I also mentioned in last week’s DTG entry, has already endured its own red-light camera scandal . The central figure in that scandal worked his way up the ranks in Boss Madigan’s Chicago ward organization..  Part of the federal investigation involves lobbying done on the behalf of Commonwealth Edison, the local electrical utility..  As far as public interest, the jaded residents of Illinois will have reasons to keep their attention focused on these scandals. Why? Because people hate utilities. They hate red-light cameras. They hate politicians..  Yes, people keep re-electing the latter, but Boss Michael Madigan, the Michelangelo of gerrymanderers, mocks the electoral system by creating legislative districts that all but ensures Democratic super-majorities in the Illinois General Assembly..  And increasingly, people hate Illinois. The Prairie State has lost population for six straight years. And no, cold winters aren’t the reason. The states that border Illinois, as well as nearby Michigan, are gaining residents..  As nauseum pols and media figures are calling–again–for “meaningful reform” in Illinois. Here are my suggestions: Amend the state constitution to ban gerrymandering, and bring term limits to the General Assembly–four terms in the House and two in the Senate. Majority leaders, minority leaders, House speakers and Senate president should be limited to four-year terms. And while we are amending the constitution, the pension guarantee clause needs to dropped, but while protecting those recipients on the lower and of the pension scale..  Did you know that state legislators can be paid lobbyists ? Ban that too..  Also, the state needs a strong inspector general with the power investigate General Assembly members..

287,"LOOKING AT THE ‘ILLINOIS EXODUS’ Is there really an ‘Illinois exodus’? Here's where Illinois and Iowa residents are moving. Graham Ambrose.  Are Illinois residents really fleeing for Iowa? Census data says they are not. TODD MIZENER, tmizener@qconline.com.  When Rock Island County approved an 8.9% property tax increase weeks ago, the blowback on social media was vehement..  Tax increases are seldom popular, but doubly so on the western border of cash-strapped Illinois, where residents on both sides of the river believe that locals are leaving for Iowa..  Illinois ranks 49th out of 50 states in net migration loss. Between 2012 and 2018, the state shrank by 134,000 residents, according to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau..  According to many of its politicians, journalists and everyday residents, Illinois is undergoing an exodus of people and resources ..  Some blame high taxes. Others a broken school system..  In the Quad-Cities, popular belief says that Illinoisians are crossing the border en masse and resettling in the Hawkeye State..  But new data from the U.S. Census Bureau point to a surprising truth: Roughly the same proportion of Illinoisians and Iowans moved out of their respective states last year..  Data show that most Illinoisians aren’t moving to Iowa. Instead, they’re bailing for different Midwestern states..  The Times analyzed Census estimates to understand where Illinois and Iowa residents are going. The data show the extent to which the so-called “Illinois exodus” is benefiting Iowa, or other states altogether..  The data show definitively that Illinois is the top destination for Iowans who leave the Hawkeye State. But Iowa isn’t even in the top five destinations for Illinoisians who leave the Land of Lincoln..  More Illinoisians moved to Indiana, Florida, Wisconsin, California, Missouri and Texas, the data show. Quad-Cities growing unequally, some play the blame game Which city has more people: Rock Island, Ill., or Bettendorf, Iowa?.  The trends aren’t positive for Illinois. The data show that Iowa to Illinois migration is slowing, while Illinois to Iowa is picking up. × Already a subscriber? Log in or Activate your account .

By December 1, 2019 Evanston is starting a reparations fund..  An Evanston, Illinois Aldermen is making sure that African-Americans receive some type of reparations from the legal sale of recreational marijuana. Aldermen Robin Rue Simmons , of the 5th ward, proposed a plan to direct all sales tax revenue collected from recreational marijuana purchases into an account that will allow for reparations locally, and this week, it was approved..  According to the Chicago Tribune , the program’s goal is to help Evanston’s Black population stay in the city and will also offer job training and other benefits..  “We can implement funding to directly invest in Black Evanston,” said Ald. Robin Rue Simmons..  — Illinois city plans reparations fund for Black residents using cannabis revenue.  In Illinois, where the state Legislature easily approved the sale of recreational marijuana this past spring, some communities have been hesitant to allow businesses in their own backyards, particularly in the suburbs, as reported in USA Today . While Chicago plans to allow cannabis sales, some suburban local precincts have decided to opt-out..  The suburb of Evanston and its’ leaders are using this local reparations program as an opportunity to tackle the ongoing outcomes of institutional slavery and discrimination against Blacks..  Alderman Simmons also saw this as an opportunity to correct the wrongs done against Black residents of Evanston that may have been incarcerated due to the “war on drugs” and spent time behind bars for smoking marijuana which is now recreationally legal in Illinois, the Chicago Tribune reported..  The tax on marijuana will “be invested in the community it unfairly policed and damaged,” Simmons said..  — New push for racial equality for Black entrepreneurs in the marijuana trade.  A local committee of residents will now examine how the money should be allocated and best practices of supporting the Black community through housing, education, and economic incentives..  According to the City of Evanston staff reports the fund will have a cap of $10 million, with the city projecting to make $500,000 to $750,000 annually in marijuana sales tax..  “I support the approval of the ordinance for the city of Evanston to commit all of the anticipated tax revenue from the recreational marijuana businesses, to support work aimed at intentionally repairing harms done to the Black community from policies and practices in so many different areas,” said Oliver Ruff , a retired teacher and Evanston resident..

293,"The ‘Illinois Exodus’ – You can pay me now, or pay me later January 6, 2020.  Late last year, two government reports added to the growing body of evidence that mismanagement of government finances have led to significant outmigration from the Land of Lincoln..  The annual population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau showed Illinois’ population declined for the sixth consecutive year in 2019. And a report from the Internal Revenue Service (with more thorough data on people and money but only updated through 2018) showed large-scale net out-migration of people and taxable income..  As more than a few observers have noted, it ain’t just the weather . Here’s a look at population in Illinois and its neighboring (cold) states since 2010. (The chart is indexed to 2010 = 1.0 to make the states the same size, helping the comparison).  Looking across the 50 states, the tendency is the warmer the state (especially in winter), the better the population growth. But that tendency is not nearly as strong as other variables of interest, including measures of government finances..  For example, WalletHub computes and reports an annual ranking of the 50 states based on their measure of state “tax burden.” WalletHub adds property, sales, and income tax revenue for the states, relating them to overall state personal income. On that basis, Illinois has ranked in the bottom 10 states for tax burden (based on how high) in the last three years. And looking across the 50 states, the 10 states with the lowest population growth in the last decade had much lower-than-average rankings on WalletHub’s tax burden measure compared to an average ranking for the 10 states with the best population growth..  Here’s a look at comparing state population growth rankings to their rankings on WalletHub’s “tax burden” measure. The states at the upper right (including the red dot, Illinois) have both low population growth and high (worse) WalletHub tax burdens..  “You can pay me now,” or” you can pay me later” were the punch lines in a 1970s commercial for Fram Oil Filters . So it goes, after a fashion, with government spending and taxes. Despite advertised balanced budget requirements in 49 of the 50 states, many states have run up huge debts anyway. They did so by running up the credit cards in ways that, until recently, never showed up as debt on the balance sheet. Accrual expenses ran far ahead of revenue – and they didn’t tax their citizens enough, given what they were spending (including expenses arising with distributing unfunded pension promises)..  The result is that it isn’t just current taxpayers facing high tax “burdens.” Taxpayers in states like Illinois aren’t just threatened by current tax bills. The overall measure of state fiscal health reflected in Truth in Accounting’s (TIA) “Taxpayer Burden” accounts for the impact of debt on future taxpayer resources – for the taxpayers that choose to stick around, anyway..  Here’s a look at states using TIA’s “Taxpayer Burden” rankings, comparing them to population result. The same tendency holds – the higher the “Taxpayer Burden,” the lower the population growth. Again, Illinois is that little red dot in the picture below, ranking 2 nd to last both on population growth and TIA’s Taxpayer Burden..  Compare the results for both WalletHub’s “Tax Burden” and TIA’s “Taxpayer Burden” to the chart below, which compares population growth to the “Average Winter Temperature” variable we include in our State Data Lab (soon to be “Data-Z”) website. The relationship for cold winters and population growth isn’t nearly as strong as it is for the government financial condition rankings..  Growing awareness of the “Illinois Exodus” isn’t restricted to right-wing think tanks or selected newspapers. Real estate professionals are also paying attention. And for good reason..  The chart below shows rankings of the states based on population growth in the last decade, comparing them to rankings on home price appreciation (using reports from the Federal Housing Finance Agency) since 2010. Once again, Illinois is that little red dot up there at the upper right..  The better the population growth, the stronger the home price appreciation. And as current and future taxpayers make their migration decisions, home prices (and property tax revenues) react – that’s how it appears..  A recent article at “Accounting Coach” was titled “Is Income Tax an Expense or a Liability?” For taxpayers in Illinois and similarly-situated states like Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, the best answer could simply be “Yes.”.

Here’s a look at comparing state population growth rankings to their rankings on WalletHub’s “tax burden” measure. The states at the upper right (including the red dot, Illinois) have both low population growth and high (worse) WalletHub tax burdens..  “You can pay me now,” or” you can pay me later” were the punch lines in a 1970s commercial for Fram Oil Filters . So it goes, after a fashion, with government spending and taxes. Despite advertised balanced budget requirements in 49 of the 50 states, many states have run up huge debts anyway. They did so by running up the credit cards in ways that, until recently, never showed up as debt on the balance sheet. Accrual expenses ran far ahead of revenue – and they didn’t tax their citizens enough, given what they were spending (including expenses arising with distributing unfunded pension promises)..  The result is that it isn’t just current taxpayers facing high tax “burdens.” Taxpayers in states like Illinois aren’t just threatened by current tax bills. The overall measure of state fiscal health reflected in Truth in Accounting’s (TIA) “Taxpayer Burden” accounts for the impact of debt on future taxpayer resources – for the taxpayers that choose to stick around, anyway..  Here’s a look at states using TIA’s “Taxpayer Burden” rankings, comparing them to population result. The same tendency holds – the higher the “Taxpayer Burden,” the lower the population growth. Again, Illinois is that little red dot in the picture below, ranking 2 nd to last both on population growth and TIA’s Taxpayer Burden..  Compare the results for both WalletHub’s “Tax Burden” and TIA’s “Taxpayer Burden” to the chart below, which compares population growth to the “Average Winter Temperature” variable we include in our State Data Lab (soon to be “Data-Z”) website. The relationship for cold winters and population growth isn’t nearly as strong as it is for the government financial condition rankings..  Growing awareness of the “Illinois Exodus” isn’t restricted to right-wing think tanks or selected newspapers. Real estate professionals are also paying attention. And for good reason..  The chart below shows rankings of the states based on population growth in the last decade, comparing them to rankings on home price appreciation (using reports from the Federal Housing Finance Agency) since 2010. Once again, Illinois is that little red dot up there at the upper right..  The better the population growth, the stronger the home price appreciation. And as current and future taxpayers make their migration decisions, home prices (and property tax revenues) react – that’s how it appears..  A recent article at “Accounting Coach” was titled “Is Income Tax an Expense or a Liability?” For taxpayers in Illinois and similarly-situated states like Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, the best answer could simply be “Yes.”.  Unless they move.","[0.5228017568588257, 0.4771982431411743]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5228017568588257
295,"The city of Chicago is spending $2.7 million to make sure you’re counted in the upcoming Census, in an effort to make sure the city doesn’t lose out on federal funding tied to population..  A new decade is upon us, but has much changed among us? Big Brother really wants to know..  City Hall has been adorned with plenty of posters and banners urging Chicago residents to “be counted” in 2020..  “They’re on the elevators, they’re hanging up, they’re everywhere,” said Diane Williams..  The “Be Counted” public awareness campaign urging people in Chicago to participate in the 2020 U.S. Census is being performed free by marketing agency FCB Chicago, but the city is still investing $2.7 million in taxpayer money to prepare for the Census..  The mayor’s office said the money will go towards community grants, media buys, increasing internet hotspots, providing free computer locations, and addressing language and physical needs to help people fill out Census forms..  Cook County government also is spending $2 million on a public relations blitz to get people to take part in the Census..  However, some have questioned if that money is actually getting the message out..  “That’s an unbelievable amount of money for us to not know that it’s happening. Between my wife, who works in the city, I’m a student here in the city, you would think that that sort of thing would filter down at some point,” Vincent Elliott said..  There’s still time to get the message out. Census questionnaires don’t hit mailboxes until April, leaving 12 weeks to inform taxpayers if they’re not counted in the 2020 Census, they’re only hurting themselves..  Census data helps determine how many representatives each state gets in Congress, how state legislatures will draw up district maps, and how the federal government will dole out billions of dollars in funding for state and local governments..  Chicago officials said the city would lose approximately $1,400 a year in federal funding for every resident who doesn’t send in his or her Census data. That’s $14,000 over the next decade for every man, woman, and child not counted..  If that doesn’t inspire you, perhaps this will: not answering the Census questionnaire is a crime, and is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000..  That’s a $5,000 penalty for approximately 10 minutes of your time. Lauren Victory","[0.647986650466919, 0.35201334953308105]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.647986650466919

303,"Shattered Buddhist statues restored with help from the OI.  Jan 8, 2020 UChicago institute helps reassemble ancient, rare art from first to 6th centuries.  Some of the earliest known statues depicting the Buddha have him in startling costume—draped in the lushly folded fabric of ancient Greece or Rome. Sometimes he has Greco-Roman facial features, naturalistically rendered and muscled torsos, or is even shown protected by Hercules..  Many of these striking Buddhas hailed from Hadda, a set of monasteries in modern-day Afghanistan where Buddhism flourished for a thousand years before the rise of Islam. Located on the Silk Road, the area had frequent contact with the Mediterranean—hence the Buddha’s Hellenistic features. One of the richest collections of this unique art from Hadda was destroyed in 2001, when the Taliban ransacked the National Museum of Afghanistan and shattered the museum’s Buddha statues..  Nearly two decades later, the museum’s conservators are working with the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute , one of the world’s foremost research centers on the civilizations of the ancient Middle East, to bring the collection back to life. Supported by cultural heritage preservation grants from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, OI researchers, along with Afghan colleagues, are painstakingly cleaning, sorting and reassembling statues from the more than 7,500 fragments left behind, which museum employees swept up and saved in trunks in the basement..  “When they were broken, we lost a part of history—an important period of high artistic achievement—which these objects represent,” said Mohammad Fahim Rahimi, director of the National Museum of Afghanistan. “They are the only pieces remaining from the archaeological sites; Hadda was burned and looted during the 1980s, so these pieces at the museum are all we have left. By reviving them, we are reviving part of our history.”.  The statues are beautiful, by all accounts. First excavated by French archaeologists in the 1930s, and spanning 500 years of Afghanistan’s history between the first and sixth centuries A.D., they are an example of a rare art form unique to the region, often called the Gandharan style. Some stand alone and others in tableaus, ranging from life-size to others that can fit in the palm of a hand. But the task of reconstructing them is more than a puzzle..  The materials these ancient artisans used were primarily limestone, schist and stucco—which tend to crumble and disintegrate under duress, rather than simply crack. “It’s more like trying to assemble pieces from 30 different jigsaw puzzles that have all been dumped together—without the pictures from the boxes,” said Gil Stein, professor at the Oriental Institute and a leading expert on the rise of social complexity in the ancient Near East..  Stein heads the project, which is part of the OI’s ongoing work with the National Museum of Afghanistan Cultural Preservation Partnership . Begun in 2012, the partnership has helped restore the museum’s infrastructure, including developing a bilingual database to document the first full inventory of the museum’s collections, as well as training conservators in the latest techniques for preserving and restoring objects..  The collection is largely from the Hadda monasteries located in northwestern Afghanistan, near the modern-day city of Jalalabad. The region’s warm climate fosters citrus and pomegranate trees and helped it blossom as a center of trade on the Silk Road for centuries—thus its art influenced by both East and West..  ‘The big puzzle’.  Alejandro Gallego López, the OI’s field director in Afghanistan, explained the process of restoring the statues. First is to assess the collection—identifying and classifying features, such as archaeological motifs, and visible parts of bodies, like legs, heads or arms. This census can help them estimate how many objects there were originally (they think it was between 350 and 500)..  Each piece is photographed and then carefully treated with the latest preservation techniques by Fabio Colombo, the OI’s head conservator in Kabul. Next they’re sorted by color, texture and mortar. “Then starts the big puzzle,” Gallego López said..  Some of the objects have inventory numbers from the 1960s and ‘70s written on them, so they can try to match them with remaining records. Most of the museum’s records were lost during a fire in Afghanistan’s civil war, but earlier this year, they discovered a trove of overlooked records hidden in an old office, which contained photos and numbers of artifacts. By a stroke of luck, the surviving cards happened to focus on the Hadda collection..  So far, Gallego López said, they’ve been able to reassemble about 50 statues; he hopes they will have about 150 in the end..  “It’s really exciting work, especially when you can get a few different pieces together,” he said. “It’s very rewarding to bring them back to life.”.  Once the work is complete, the museum will exhibit them, Rahimi said. He is excited to show the history of Afghanistan to younger generations, who may not be aware of it; and also to older generations, who may remember the art. “I see a lot of reactions from people when they see the statues,” he said..  Gallego López and Stein are similarly happy that Afghans—both at the museum and the public—will be able to fully appreciate and preserve their history. “This rich cultural heritage belongs to the people of Afghanistan,” Gallego López said. Stein agreed: With the training and database in place, the National Museum will be equipped for the future. “Foreigners and grants come and go, but they’ll still have the knowledge,” he said..

He was trailed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg with 17%, former Vice President Joe Biden with 14%, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 13%, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar with 8% and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren with 6%..

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during a campaign event Tuesday at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. PATRICK SEMANSKY, ASSOCIATED PRESS.  The survey does not weight its results based on the demographic makeup of Illinois voters, including by gender, geography or race. For example, of the poll’s 1,000 registered voters, 56% were identified as male and 44% female. The federal census, however, shows a majority of the state’s population is female while 2016 exit polling showed the state’s Democratic electorate was 54% female..  The polling sample also did not accurately reflect the percentage of the vote that came from strongly Democratic Chicago compared with less Democratic suburbs and Downstate. Only a quarter of the poll’s Democratic results came from the city of Chicago, while actual voting in 2016 showed the city accounted for 35% of the state’s total Democratic primary turnout. Gov. J.B.

No matter how the political winds blow, Mike Madigan’s majority cannot be overcome, unless the Fair Maps referendum gets on the ballot. Will you help collect just 10 signatures?

308,"City of Chicago, Uber partner to boost 2020 U.S. Census count RTM Staff CITY OF CHICAGO , UBER PARTNER TO BOOST 2020 U.S. CENSUS PARTICIPATION.  CHICAGO – Today, Uber and the City of Chicago announced a partnership to support the City’s effort to boost participation in the upcoming United States Census. Uber will contribute $100,000 to be distributed to community organizations that are assisting in educating hard-to-count residents and ensuring that they understand the importance of their participation..  Only two-thirds of Chicago ans participated in the last U.S. Census. This year, Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot has set a goal of 75% participation to ensure every Chicago an is counted and that they feel safe participating. The census count begins April 1 and ends on July 31..  “A complete and accurate count in the upcoming census is vital for Chicago ’s future, especially since it determines how federal dollars are distributed for essential services, including for schools, infrastructure, affordable housing, nutrition programs and more,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “From the beginning, we made it clear that the City’s mobilization efforts would require coordination and partnership with Chicago ’s corporate, philanthropic and community organizations, which is why we are grateful Uber will help ensure all our residents are counted.”.  “Uber wants to help the City of Chicago reach its goal, especially in ensuring that those who live in hard to reach neighborhoods are counted,” said Sarfraz Maredia, Head of U.S. and Canada, Uber. “Ensuring these community organizations have the resources they need to successfully educate residents about the importance of the process is vital to the city and its residents.”.  Because this is the first year the census will be done electronically, Uber will also make its three Greenlight Hubs (driver support centers) available for census counting..  An accurate count is vital for Chicago as it determines the funding that is instrumental to maintaining infrastructure, public safety, public health, and other City services..  To ensure the selection of community organizations was transparent, the City partnered with Forefront, a non-profit and leader in preparing Illinois for the 2020 Census, in a Request for Proposal (RFP) process. Those selected will receive grant funding — including Uber’s contribution — that will help them with targeted neighborhood outreach and other initiatives to increase participation for historically-undercounted communities..  Nearly half of Chicago ’s 2.7 million residents are considered “hard-to-count” by the U.S. Census Bureau. This includes families of color, children under five, the elderly, veterans, returning residents, individuals with high rates of mobility and housing instability, residents with disabilities, those with limited access to the Internet, and those who may be afraid to participate..  To learn more about the City’s 2020 Census efforts, please visit census2020. chicago .gov to find up-to-date information on how to participate in the census, city resources aiding to ensure a full count, and what’s at stake for this year’s count.","[0.5051681399345398, 0.4948318600654602]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5051681399345398

311,"Richard Porter, an attorney and Republican National Committeeman from Illinois, laid out a swift process for Illinois to deal with its crippling pension debt, restructure its bloated government, reduce taxes and become an attractive place to live and do business..  Porter discussed the state's financial options Tuesday at an event in Chicago hosted by Truth in Accounting and DePaul University's Driehaus College of Business' John L. Keeley Jr. Center for Financial Services..  His solution? A quick GM-style bankruptcy that would replace ""Old Illinois"" with ""New Illinois,"" with help from the federal government..  It's a solution that's unlikely to gain any traction in Springfield without a whole lot of voters undergoing Howard Beale-like epiphanies. But Porter's solution has some interesting points that voters – and the people they elected – would do well to consider as Illinois circles the drain..  Porter argues that Illinois can't afford to dig out through a series of small, incremental changes as its debts continue to grow and its population continues to decline and home values fall. Those things will only exacerbate the state's financial problems and push more people to move out..  Illinois' government, he said, has essentially stopped serving the people. Rather, lawmakers continue to search for more revenue to repay its creditors. And it's not just the state. Porter pointed to Chicago's debt and population losses. He also singled out municipalities such as Harvey and North Chicago that have had to cut services as they struggle to pay for promised pensions..  Porter proposed state lawmakers come up with a plan to create a New Illinois, with a new constitution, to buy the assets of Old Illinois. During this process, he said other changes would be needed for the state to be successful once it emerges from bankruptcy. He suggested consolidating the state's more than 7,000 units of government – by far the most of any state in the nation – down to about 1,000..  ""Rather than grinding through all these problems – who wants to do that? Do you want to spend 80 years grinding through 400 different, separate municipal bankruptcies?"" he said..  Porter's plan calls for the federal government to guarantee the debt that New Illinois would take on to buy the assets of Old Illinois. It's another long shot, but not without precedent. He pointed to Brady bonds that were used in Mexico and other countries..  And the federal government would have some motivation to act because Illinois isn't alone, Porter said..  ""We're not the only state – we're sort of at the leading edge, but Connecticut's right there and New Jersey's right there,"" he said..  Porter's proposal calls for some federal help paying off the state's accumulated pension debt. However, he said that pensioners wouldn't get 100 cents on the dollar. Rather, he suggested some kind of cap or maximum – he tossed out $80,000 annually per pensioner as a limit..  In a state with a median household income of about $63,575, taxpayers can't afford to pay huge pensions to former school superintendents who retired before they turned 60. Porter singled out former New Trier Superintendent Henry Bangser's annual pension payout of more than $300,000. WTTW reported in 2017 that Bangser retired at age 57 and had already collected nearly $3 million in retirement benefits..  ""Is the purpose of government to collect taxes to pay people who have the status of government workers so they can stop working in their 50s and live the rest of their lives in comfort? Is that the purpose of government?"" he said ""... If the average person is making $65,000, I'm not going to pay someone $90,000 or $100,000 or $120,000 or $350,000 a year not to work for 40 years. That's called feudalism. That's not a republican form of government."".  He also recommended doing nothing to help out the state pension system with the worst funding ratio: The General Assembly Retirement System..  Porter's proposal is certainly interesting, but could it work? He said it will if voters continue to see their taxes increase and services decline as the value of their homes decline. He encouraged everyone to keep an eye on Zillow.","[0.50055330991745, 0.49944671988487244]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.50055330991745
312,"Get more in-depth, daily coverage of Chicago politics at The Daily Line..  CITY HALL — Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) vowed Wednesday to block a proposal crafted by Mayor Lori Lightfoot to prevent longtime residents from being pushed out of gentrifying parts of Woodlawn near the planned Obama Presidential Center that she said was totally inadequate..  In a fiery news conference at City Hall, Taylor said the mayor’s proposal would not protect Woodlawn residents from being pushed out of the area around the Obama Presidential Center, set to be built in Jackson Park. In addition, the freshman alderman accused Lightfoot and housing officials of disrespecting the largely Black and low-income community by crafting their own proposal, rather than endorsing the plan backed by a coalition of community groups..  “I was never told they were going to write their own ordinance,” Taylor said. “We are very smart, competent folks. We can come up with our own plan for our own community.”.  RELATED: City’s Scaled-Back Obama Center Housing Plan Doesn’t Do Enough To Protect Woodlawn, Alderman Says.  A measure introduced by the mayor but opposed by the alderman whose ward it affects would be unlikely to pass, as aldermen would follow the unwritten but deeply entrenched practice of aldermanic prerogative..  Don Terry, a spokesman for the Chicago Department of Housing, said the Lightfoot administration was committed to “an inclusive approach to creating well-rounded legislation that will preserve access to housing for low- and middle-income residents in the area and ensure equitable, inclusive growth.”.  The mayor’s proposal would apply only to census tracts within three-fifths of a mile of the Obama Presidential Center. The proposed community benefits agreement backed by Taylor and the Obama CBA Coalition, which comprises seven groups, wants protections to apply to all properties within a two-mile radius of the center. While Woodlawn would be included in the mayor’s plan, most of South Shore and Washington Park would not..  RELATED: City Unveils Scaled-Back Plan For Preserving Affordable Housing Near Obama Center.  The coalition’s proposal is designed to ensure that housing built on land now owned by the city is affordable to families earning $40,000 a year or less..  In addition, any new housing developments should be required to set aside 30 percent of their units for low- and moderate-income residents, according to the coalition’s proposal..  The coalition also demanded that the current proposal be expanded to include not only Woodlawn but also South Shore, Grand Crossing, Hyde Park, Washington Park and Kenwood..  “This is not what the community asked for, and they’ve said it over and over and over and over and over again,” Taylor said. “This doesn’t protect anybody.”.  A majority of aldermen have endorsed the coalition’s proposal for a community benefits agreement..  The Obama Foundation and former Mayor Rahm Emanuel rebuffed the coalition’s demand for a community benefits agreement, but Lightfoot promised during the 2019 mayoral campaign to back legal protections for residents near the Obama Center..  Taylor said city officials had failed to take the demands of Woodlawn residents seriously because they are Black and low-income..  “If this was anywhere else there would not be a conversation,” Taylor said..  Taylor called the Lightfoot’s administration’s draft report outlining guidelines for development in Woodlawn near the planned Obama Center released Jan. 30 at a community meeting “a sham.”.  “I don’t feel like this process has been fair,” Taylor said. “I’ve been told one thing, and another has been happening.”.  The city must act immediately to stop gentrification and displacement, Taylor said, adding that she would “meet in the middle” to reach an agreement with the mayor..  Taylor said Lightfoot had given commissioners too much power as she works to end aldermanic prerogative..  “She thinks she does not have to listen to me and she does not have to work with me,” Taylor said. “So I’m going to fight her and everybody else on making sure that this doesn’t pass. It is either get right, or get right out of office.” Share this:","[0.5013247132301331, 0.49867528676986694]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5013247132301331

A U.S. House delegation that once had 27 members will, after this year’s census, surely fall to 17..  Presidential candidates are not mingling with voters at rural elementary schools or Naperville pancake houses because Illinois isn’t considered a competitive hotbed, not in primary season and not for Electoral College votes in the general election..  Illinois also used to be considered a swing state, drawing candidates from both parties to pound the flesh.

Voters since then supported Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama twice, and Hillary Clinton..  Yet the governor suggests Illinois should have first-stop primary privileges.

327,"As protesters journeyed throughout the town; white onlookers were present. But, that didn’t stop them from speaking out about change. Jun 12, 2020, 3:30pm Miranda Christopher REVOLT.TV is home to exclusive interviews from rising stars to the biggest entertainers and public figures of today. Here is where you get the never-before-heard stories about what’s really happening in the culture from the people who are pushing it forward. It’s been over weeks since George Floyd was killed at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. The country is still reeling over his senseless death and protests have erupted around the world as people demand an end to police brutality and racism. On Saturday (June 6), Dawn Jenkins and Rukiya Penn organized a peaceful protest in Lake Bluff, a suburban village outside of Chicago, Illinois. Per the town’s 2019 Census, 92% of Lake Bluff’s population consists of white people and only 0.58% of the small town is made up of Black residents. Meeting at their town’s train station, the protesters walked over to Veterans Memorial in the nearby park and began to chant “ Black Lives Matter ” and “No justice, no peace.” As they journeyed throughout the town with their handwritten signs held high; white onlookers were present. These men, women and children were out having brunch, riding their bikes, jogging and, out and about enjoying the day. Related “Black Lives Matter” mural artist opens up about painting the bold statement in front of the White House and more Most of the reactions to the protest were well-received. Many of the onlookers honked their horns, cheered and clapped, as the protesters walked through the suburban neighborhood. Kathleen O’Hara, the Mayor of Lake Bluff, approached the protesters to thank them for what they were doing. “We appreciate the message,” she said. “Thank y’all. Welcome to Lake Bluff.” Speaking out in this area of mostly white people made sense. If Black people want real change , white people have to help. They have to be the ones to call each other out on their racist and stereotypical views, and demand diversity in their workplaces and businesses. Change starts with them. Penn and Jenkins both shared speeches with the growing crowd. They spoke about the struggles of being Black in America and also challenged their Caucasian allies to fight racism in their daily lives. “We mourn the loss of our brothers and sisters, and we live on edge waiting for other names to be added to the list,” Penn said. “It has to stop.” Other protesters shared their points of view about the current climate of our country. Jenkins, a Black housewife and student, revealed how the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor made her feel. Related America’s serious problem with police brutality against black and brown communities “I have several emotions that I feel: anger, sadness and fear,” she said. “I am angry because it is yet another one. Another brother or sister whose life has been taken for no reason. I am sad because this manner of death has been bestowed on people of color far too often. Far too many names to scream out loud in protest. I am fearful for our future as Americans and people of color. I mean, what world are we leaving for our children if the attitudes and behaviors never change among those sworn to protect us? Without real systemic change, I feel it will be more of the same.” Kelly Dobbins, a 23-year-old white teacher, said that it was important for her to be at this protest as an ally for Black people . “This movement can’t happen without an allyship from white people,” she said. “We started the problem, we have to help end it, too.” Casey Richardson, a white 29-year-old stay-at-home mom, shared what she wants to see be amended as a result of the numerous protests taking place in the U.S. “Nothing short or systemic change,” she stated. “Defund police, increase funding to community programs, especially in minority communities. Ensure repercussions for police who use excessive force. I am not as educated as the Black Lives Matter organization, but I will support them in their platforms.” Related How can we find solutions when no one is listening to our problems? Black people need to take the power back Lindsay Kuper, a 23-year-old white woman from Northbrook, Illinois; revealed what she will continue to do to combat racism. “I will continue to fight racism outside of protesting by donating my money and time to organizations that support the Black communities,” she said. “I will visit poorer communities and educate myself, as well. I will have those difficult conversations everyday with friends, family and strangers about racism. Talk about our history and even ask more questions. I will continue to educate myself on the injustice that has been going on for centuries. I will not stop until Black lives are treated and seen as equal members of the community.” The group’s fight is far from over. George Floyd’s killers have been arrested and charged, but they need to be convicted. The cops who killed Breonna Taylor are still free . Ahmaud Arbery still needs people to keep his name alive as his trial begins . Continue to fight for equality in these communities, workplaces and schools. Go out and exercise your right to vote, not only in November, but also in your local elections. Police have to be held accountable for their actions toward Black men, women and children. Black lives do matter. The rest of the country and world just need to realize that, too.

During the first nights of unrest in Chicago, it was revealed that members of the Chicago Police were inside the campaign office of Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL). Instead of doing their jobs, they were caught on camera sleeping on the job, taking food from the freezer, drinking the beverages and making a mockery of the protesters..  ""Once again, the Chicago Police Department has revealed its true nature, true character. They entered my office without being invited. They, in the midst of looting and rioting in the midst of their fellow officers being pummeled, and bricks and bottles being thrown at them all across the city in those tumultuous days, here they are, these 13 officers decided they were going to abandon their posts and relax in my office,"" said Rush..  Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot and police superintendent David O. Brown have promised a swift investigation into whether the cops violated their duties..  Images of the 13 Chicago Police officers making coffee and popping popcorn surfaced and its got the nation talking..  Chicago as with many other localities have an issue with police brutality. After all, the Laquan McDonald shooting was one of the catalysts of protests against the city's police force..

He said the office was burglarized and looted..  Mayor Lori Lightfoot greets Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL) and Chicago Police Superintendent David O. Brown. Rush appeared on CNN to condemn Donald J. Trump for not allowing the Dallas Police Department police chief, the Dallas County Sheriff and Dallas County prosecutor join the roundtable discussion on police reform. The three are African American. More on that later..  According to the Chicago Sun-Times, there was an alarm that went off at Rush's office on Sunday May 31 near 10pm. The windows were broken. Police entered the facility on June 1 near 1am. They left the office around 4:30am..  They were not aware they were being recorded while in the office..  Lightfoot was with Rush when she did her presser. She promised to identify the 13 officers, their supervisors and told there is going to be an internal investigation into the matter..  Chicago Division Fraternal Order of Police president John Catanzara slammed the decision. He said that Rush is a ""damn liar"" and said that he invited the cops to his office..  Union president caught posting racist shit. Trump congratulated Cantanzara on becoming the FOP president. Chicago/Cook County Republican chairman Steve Boulton said a statement, ""We strongly question whether officers entered without invitation or acted without authorization."".  Rush's spokesman Jeremy Edwards said, ""Nobody from Congressman Rush's staff invited the police in, and they certainly did not tell them to make themselves at home."" He also noted if police needed a break, a police station was nearby. The Wentworth Precinct was nearby..  Chicago, America's third largest city is a dog whistle for racists. They often equate ""Black on whatever"" violence to the city. They often use this city as a scapegoat to target Barack Obama, Rev. Al Sharpton, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Louis Farrakhan, Sen.

329,"Virus-hit Chicago jail runs out of home confinement gear Updated 10:48 am CDT, Friday, May 8, 2020.  CHICAGO (AP) — The effort to reduce the population at Cook County Jail to slow the spread of the coronavirus hit another snag when the sheriff announced that he has run out of electronic monitoring bracelets that defendants wear when they're placed on home confinement..  The sheriff's department said Thursday that the lack of the bracelets will mean that defendants who might otherwise have been sent home will have to remain in jail, where hundreds of detainees and staffers have been infected by the virus in recent weeks..  The lack of bracelets “threatens to undo the successes we have achieved in slowing the spread of the virus,” said jail spokeswoman Sophia Ansari..  Judges, attorneys and the sheriff's office have been scrambling to get as many non-violent offenders out of jail as quickly as possible — an effort that has seen its population shrink from about 5,400 in late March to just over 4,000 this week..  The announcement comes at a particularly difficult time because, like other jails around the country, Cook County Jail typically sees its population climb when the weather gets warmer and the number of arrests climb..  Sharlyn Grace, executive director of the Chicago Community Bond Fund, a nonprofit that posts bond for destitute detainees, said something must be done..  “Given the consequences right now of people being jailed, we can’t allow a supply issue to be putting people at risk of getting sick, or death,” Grace said, adding that there are about 500 detainees who, if they were able to post bond and ordered on electronic monitoring, would have to stay in jail..  Sheriff Tom Dart, whose office runs the jail, has long expressed concern about the electronic monitoring program and his office's ability to monitor defendants facing serious charges. His concerns have only grown now that the supply of bracelets run out..  “We have been at, or exceeding, capacity in EM for some time. However, this capacity has now formally asserted itself,” he wrote in a letter to county officials...  Dart urged the county's criminal justice system to come up with a process that would remove defendants from electronic monitoring after a certain period so that the bracelets could be used by other jail detainees..  Chief Judge Timothy Evans' spokeswoman said that judges would be willing to work with attorneys to identify defendants who were issued the monitoring bracelets before the pandemic to determine which ones can give them up so they can be used by other defendants..  “This is obviously a concern given that the use of electronic monitoring has helped reduce the jail population before and during the pandemic,” spokesman Pat Milhizer said in a statement.

330,"For Immediate Release No. 20-OPA-040 EPA awards City of Chicago $500,000 to clean up former manufacturing site on North Kimball Avenue.  Part of $1.2 Million for Brownfield Cleanups in Illinois.  CHICAGO (May 6, 2020) --Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that the City of Chicago will receive $500,000 to assess and clean up a contaminated property under the Agency’s Brownfield’s Program. Under President Trump’s Administration, EPA has delivered approximately $287 million in Brownfield grants directly to communities and nonprofits for cleanup and redevelopment, job creation, and economic development through the award of over 948 grants..  “These communities are ready to move forward with redevelopment, they just lacked the funding to take that next step,” said EPA Regional Administrator Kurt Thiede. “EPA’s Brownfields grants help jumpstart the process by providing support for assessments and cleanups.”.  “The Illinois EPA, on behalf of this year’s Brownfield grantees, appreciates U.S. EPA’s continuing financial support to advance the environmental investigation, cleanup, and redevelopment of brownfields sites in Illinois.” said Illinois EPA Director John J. Kim. “We look forward to partnering with these municipalities as they work to improve their communities by making these sites once again available for productive use.”.  “Cleaning up contaminated sites is an important step in protecting the children’s health—and the health of all Illinoisans—but it also helps spur development, job creation and economic growth in our state,” U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth said. “As a founder of the Senate’s first Environmental Justice Caucus, I have pushed for more funding for the Brownfields program and to help low-income communities face the public health challenges they are disproportionately affected by. I’ll continue working to ensure all of our communities can breathe clean air and live in a safe environment without fear of toxins and pollution.”.  Nationwide, this year, the agency is announcing the selection of 155 grants for communities and tribes totaling over $65.6 million in EPA brownfields funding the agency’s Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup Grant Programs. These funds will aid under-served and economically disadvantaged communities, including neighborhoods located in Opportunity Zones, in assessing and cleaning up abandoned industrial and commercial properties. An Opportunity Zone is an economically-distressed community where new investment, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. Of the 151 total communities selected, 118 of these communities can potentially assess or clean up brownfield sites in census tracts designated in these zones. In addition, nearly 30% of the communities selected today will receive brownfields funding for the first time..  EPA also announced a $500,000 award to the City of Peoria, and a $275,000 award to the City of Rockford bringing the total to over $1.2 million in brownfields funding for Illinois..  “The City of Chicago is thrilled to be one of three Illinois recipients of a US EPA Cleanup Grant in 2020, continuing our city’s long-standing partnership with the agency,” said Lori Lightfoot Mayor, City of Chicago. “This grant will allow us to begin the cleanup of the contamination at a brownfield site left behind by a long history of industrial and manufacturing operations, and significantly advance the site’s redevelopment as a public access park.”.  EPA has awarded $500,000 to the City of Chicago to clean up a former manufacturing site located at 1807-1815 North Kimball Avenue. Historically, the site has been used as a lumberyard, machine shop, warehouse, automobile garage, and fluorescent light fixture manufacturing facility. It has been vacant and unused since 2005 and is contaminated with volatile organic compounds and trichloroethene. Grant funds also will be used to support community engagement activities..  Grants awarded by EPA’s Brownfields Program provide communities across the country with an opportunity to transform contaminated sites into community assets that attract jobs and achieve broader economic development outcomes, while taking advantage of existing infrastructure. For example, brownfields grants are shown to:.  Increase Local Tax Revenue: A study of 48 brownfields sites found that an estimated $29 million to $97 million in additional local tax revenue was generated in a single year after cleanup. This is two to seven times more than the $12.4 million EPA contributed to the cleanup of these sites..  Increase Residential Property Values: Another study found that property values of homes near revitalized brownfields sites increased between 5% and 15% following cleanup..  Background.  A brownfield is a property for which the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. There are estimated to be more than 450,000 brownfields in the United States. EPA’s Brownfields Program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $1.6 billion in brownfield grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, brownfields investments have leveraged more than $31 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding, from both public and private sources, leveraged more than 160,000 jobs..  The next National Brownfields Training Conference will be held on April 26-30, 2021, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Offered every two years, this conference is the largest gathering of stakeholders focused on cleaning up and reusing former commercial and industrial properties. EPA co-sponsors this event with the International City/County Management Association..

331,"MCHENRY - State Rep. Steve Reick (R-McHenry) appealed to Governor Pritzker Friday in a letter he shared with Illinois Review :.  Dear Governor Pritzker:.  During the past several months, I’ve done my best to give you the benefit of the doubt as you grapple with the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. I’ve done so because I have a great appreciation for the pressures you are under, and I know that you have done what you believe to be in the best interests of the people of Illinois. None of us has been through this before, and I was not going to engage in second-guessing..  However, I’m obliged to tell you that your “Restore Illinois” plan, as it affects the people of the 63rd District and McHenry County as a whole is misguided, and must be either changed or scrapped. To include McHenry County within the region that includes Chicago and Cook County is to ignore the realities that exist here..  Please allow me to give you some statistics to back up my position:.  As of May 5th, McHenry County has recorded 817 cases of COVID-19 and 43 deaths. Of those, 313 cases and 19 deaths have occurred in nursing homes and other residential care facilities where there is a much higher concentration of co-morbidity. There have been at least 23 confirmed cases and 8 deaths at Sheltered Village, a private home for the developmentally disabled in Woodstock which, for whatever reason, are not included in these statistics. There have been 3,764 total tests for COVID-19 as of May 5th. The “positivity rate” which your plan relies upon to allow regions to move forward, is 21.7%, but if you take out the 313 reported cases from residential care, the positivity rate among the general population drops to 13.3%, far below the 20% called for in your plan..  I could go on, but let me cut to the chase:.  In your introduction to “Restore Illinois,"" you explain that your plan begins with the 11 Emergency Medical Service Regions that IDPH has “traditionally guided its statewide public health work."" I think we can agree that there is nothing “traditional” about COVID-19..  Following on that is the recommendation that McHenry County (Region 9) be lumped into the Northeast Health Region, along with Chicago and Cook County, which have the highest concentrations of infection and death in the State. This is unacceptable..  By putting McHenry County into this region, your plan guarantees that it will be bound, not by the dedicated efforts of our county Emergency Management Agency and Health Department and by our local governments, nor the community spirit that abounds here as we do our part to stop this disease, but by cold statistics that cannot help but be skewed by a population density over which we have no control..  Governor, there has to be a better way to allow this economy to open..  Please allow me several suggestions that you may consider: One way would be to make Cook County its own region, allowing the collar counties to rely upon their own resources and results to determine the pace at which they may begin to come back, as has been proposed by the EMA director in Will County. Another would be to allow decisions to be made within regions defined by a hospital’s service area. After all, the primary consideration in your first Executive Order was to make sure we did not overwhelm the capacity of our health system. This would provide for a more nimble response in the event of a recurrence of the disease..  Either way, I cannot but oppose your “Restore Illinois” plan as currently proposed. The economy of the 63rd district is made up of hard-working entrepreneurs, small businesses and restaurants, all of which are strangling from the effects of a one-size-fits-all solution. The people of this District understand the situation, and are fully capable of making sensible choices that are in their own interests and the interests of their neighbors. McHenry County cannot remain closed until Chicago recovers. We will not allow our hands to be tied. That’s a simple fact that cannot be ignored..  I hope that you will consider what I’ve said in the spirit in which it is given, because it was said with the sincere hope that we may soon see the end of this and move on to find solutions to the other problems that plague our State. I’m happy to talk with you at any time. Very truly yours,","[0.5190647840499878, 0.480935275554657]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5190647840499878

Sharlyn Grace, executive director of the Chicago Community Bond Fund, a nonprofit that posts bond for destitute detainees, said something must be done..  “Given the consequences right now of people being jailed, we can’t allow a supply issue to be putting people at risk of getting sick, or death,” Grace said, adding that there are about 500 detainees who, if they were able to post bond and ordered on electronic monitoring, would have to stay in jail..  Sheriff Tom Dart, whose office runs the jail, has long expressed concern about the electronic monitoring program and his office's ability to monitor defendants facing serious charges. His concerns have only grown now that the supply of bracelets run out..  “We have been at, or exceeding, capacity in EM for some time. However, this capacity has now formally asserted itself,” he wrote in a letter to county officials...  Dart urged the county's criminal justice system to come up with a process that would remove defendants from electronic monitoring after a certain period so that the bracelets could be used by other jail detainees..  Chief Judge Timothy Evans' spokeswoman said that judges would be willing to work with attorneys to identify defendants who were issued the monitoring bracelets before the pandemic to determine which ones can give them up so they can be used by other defendants..  “This is obviously a concern given that the use of electronic monitoring has helped reduce the jail population before and during the pandemic,” spokesman Pat Milhizer said in a statement.

334,"Virus-hit Chicago jail runs out of home confinement gear Updated 11:48 am EDT, Friday, May 8, 2020.  CHICAGO (AP) — The effort to reduce the population at Cook County Jail to slow the spread of the coronavirus hit another snag when the sheriff announced that he has run out of electronic monitoring bracelets that defendants wear when they're placed on home confinement..  The sheriff's department said Thursday that the lack of the bracelets will mean that defendants who might otherwise have been sent home will have to remain in jail, where hundreds of detainees and staffers have been infected by the virus in recent weeks..  The lack of bracelets “threatens to undo the successes we have achieved in slowing the spread of the virus,” said jail spokeswoman Sophia Ansari..

336,"Only five states have had more residents die from a COVID-19 infection than Illinois, but the survival rate among those with the virus is better in Illinois than in almost half of all the states..  Only New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan and California have had more deaths than Illinois' 3,111 fatalities as of Thursday..   But in 23 states and the District of Columbia, people with COVID-19 were more likely to die than in Illinois, a Daily Herald analysis of state COVID-19 statistics shows..  The highest fatality rate is in Michigan, at 9.5% of those who test positive for the coronavirus, accounting for 4,345 deaths. That compares to 4.4% of patients dying among those who test positive in Illinois..  After Michigan, states with the highest fatality rates are Connecticut at 8.8%, New York at 8%, Louisiana at 7.2% and New Jersey at 6.6%..  The lowest fatality rate is in South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, all at 1.1%..  New York leads the country in the number of deaths with 26,144, according to a national COVID-19 status report from the Kaiser Family Foundation ..   Statistics for Chicago and the suburbs nearly mirror those for Illinois as a whole, since almost 92% of the state's cases are from the nine counties defined by Gov. J.B. Pritzker last week as for purposes of coronavirus control..  The nine-county Northeast region alone has more deaths than 44 states and the District of Columbia, but it has a fatality rate similar to that of Illinois as a whole..  The Northeast region is one of four in the state where infection rates, hospitalizations and hospital readiness are being monitored by Illinois officials to determine when to ease social and business restrictions. The nine counties in the region are Cook, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will..  Health officials across the country have noted that poverty and access to health care play a role in the rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths..  Public health experts also caution that variations in how tests are performed and in the number of tests make it difficult to compare data..   ""It's hard to compare one place to the next because all of this is evolving rapidly,"" said Dr. Mark Steven Dworkin, professor and associate director of epidemiology at the University of Illinois-Chicago's School of Public Health. ""Testing is still different, which can affect all the things you're seeing."".  Here's a look at how Illinois and stack up nationally on some other key measures..  Cases, infection rates Just three states, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, had more confirmed COVID-19 infections than Illinois as of Thursday..  The 70,871 confirmed cases in Illinois were more than the combined cases in the 21 states with the lowest number of infections..  Illinois had the 10th highest infection rate in the country, with 18.7% of those tested through Thursday being positive for the virus. The rate for the state's Northeast region was even higher, at 22.4%..  New Jersey's 51% infection rate led the nation. That state conducted 261,869 tests, and 133,345 were confirmed with infections..  In recent weeks, Illinois has increased testing capacity and opened the opportunity to be tested to a larger segment of the population. While the number of cases has grown, the infection rate has declined..  ""As testing eligibility expands, we'd expect to see fewer positive cases because the groups that have a high risk of being exposed to COVID-19 or that are most likely to be sick from COVID-19 are at a lower proportion of those being tested,"" said Hanna Kite, a Cook spokeswoman..  Testing Only New York, California, Florida and Texas performed more tests on their residents than Illinois. Through Thursday, Illinois had conducted 379,043 COVID-19 tests. New York had tested the most of any state, conducting nearly 1.1 million tests..  The 290,201 tests conducted on residents in the nine counties of Illinois' Northeast region account for more than 76% of all the tests in the state. The Northeast region alone conducted more tests than either Pennsylvania or New Jersey..  Meanwhile, Illinois has tested slightly less than 3% of the population. Eleven states and the District of Columbia have tested a greater percentage of their population. However, all of those locales -- except New York -- have significantly fewer residents than Illinois..  In , 3.4% of the population has been tested, according to an analysis of census records and IDPH data. That's higher than nine states and Washington, D.C..  Per capita rates In Illinois, COVID-19 has infected 560 of every 100,000 residents. That's the ninth highest per capita infection rate in the country. New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts all have rates higher than 1,000 infected residents per 100,000, according to the national statistics..  The virus has also killed 25 of every 100,000 residents in Illinois, the 11th highest per capita rate. In New York, the virus has killed 134 of every 100,000 residents, the highest in the nation..  In Illinois' Northeast region, the virus has infected 752 of every 100,000 residents, and killed 33 of every 100,000. The per capita infection rate is higher than that of 44 states, and the per capita fatality rate is higher than that of 42 states..  0 Comments","[0.5402612686157227, 0.45973873138427734]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5402612686157227
337,"Jan 18, 2020 at 6:00am Getty.  Although the Women’s March in Chicago was canceled last year, it’s back on for 2020. Here are all the details about what to expect and when it’s happening on Saturday, January 18, 2020. The March Begins at 11 a.m. & Won’t Be Canceled for the Weather.  Participants will meet at 11 a.m. local time on Saturday, January 18, 2020 at Grant Park at the main entrance at Ida B. Wells and Columbus Drives, according to the event’s website . An accessible entrance will be at Columbus Dr. and Monroe Street..  The march will then end at the Federal Plaza around 1 p.m. You can find more details at the event’s Facebook page here or the website here ..  Here’s a map of Grant Park’s location near the main entrance, where marchers are asked to gather..  The march begins at 11 a.m. sharp, led by top elected women officials. It will proceed through a “ Gallery of Issues ” where participants can learn about important causes, like the 2020 census, gun violence, health care, voting, and more..  The march will end at the Federal Plaza. The city has asked that participants leave right away. The organizers have noted that there are restaurants nearby you can go to if you don’t want to leave right away..  This year’s march will NOT include a formal program. However, it will occur rain or shine or snow. ‌.  It won’t be canceled, according to the event’s Facebook page..  Marchers are asked to using public transportation if they can, since there will be crowds and a lot of traffic. Or you can book parking through SpotHero or ParkWhiz if you’re driving. Millennium Garages will also have the most convenient parking options..  Last year in 2019, the Women’s March in Chicago was canceled . In 2017, 250,000 people had attneded the March and about 300,000 attended in 2018. So the cancelation was a disappointment to a lot of people last year..  The Chicago chapter of the Women’s March canceled their rally in 2018 as controversy about the Women’s March grew. The Chicago Tribune reported that the Women’s March Chicago organizers said they were canceling the event because of limited volunteer hours and high costs. They made the announcement two months before the event. People who wanted to participate were asked to join in “Operation: Activation,” which is essentially encouraging them to get involved in other activities and to help other people on that day..  But this year, things are different. The organizers have decided they are hosting an event no matter what the weather does or what other obstacles they may encounter. So if you show up for the Women’s March in Chicago today, you’ll definitely see other people there..  Chicago is expecting a big crowd for the 2020 event. The event will pay special honor to people with disabilities, according to the Chicago Tribune . Volunteers will clear paths and escort anyone with disabilities to transporation hubs and other important points along the way..  Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Illinois Lt. Gov. Julianna Stratton will also be participating in the march, The Chicago Tribune shared.","[0.5395081639289856, 0.4604918360710144]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5395081639289856

339,"NBC 5 will livestream part of the march Saturday morning in the player above ..  Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to march across the country to participate in the annual Women’s March Saturday in over 180 cities—including Chicago..  Organizers said they expect about 100,000 people to march across the country to participate in this year’s Women’s March, with up to 10,000 people expected at the march in Washington, far fewer than the turnout last year, when about 100,000 people held a rally east of the White House. Instead of a single big event, the group has been holding actions in a run-up to the march this week around three key issues: climate change, immigration and reproductive rights..  Despite stormy, wet weather in the Chicago area, Grant Park is set to open up at 9 a.m., with the main entrance located at Ida B. Wells and Columbus Drive (though accessible entrance for persons with disabilities is located at Columbus Dr. and Monroe St.)..  The week reflects that the movement is “moving into the next stage,” said director Caitlin Breedlove..  Leaders of MoveOn.org, which organized some of the anti-Iran war protests, agreed. Mobilization manager Kate Alexander said the group and its members pulled together over 370 protests in 46 states in less than 48 hours to show resistance to Trump’s actions. The president ordered airstrikes that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s Quds Force who has been blamed for deadly attacks on U.S. troops and allies going back decades. Iran pledged retribution, sparking fears of an all-out war..  Alexander noted that the Iran protest is just one of many issues MoveOn members have organized in response to in the past few years..  “It’s not that there are fewer people mobilizing — it’s that they’re mobilized in different campaigns. There’s more to do,” Alexander said. “I don’t believe people are tuning out. I think people are lying in wait.”.  While waiting, many have passed on some major moments in Trump’s presidency. Resistance groups rallied on the eve of the House vote for impeachment, but even some of those who participated said they were disappointed more people didn’t turn out..  Several organizations also said much of their organizing is done through social media or text message and email programs, which are less visible but have a significant impact. In 2018, the Women’s March had over 24 billion social media impressions, Breedlove said..  Atef Said, a sociology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said all social movements evolve over time. He noted the Trump resistance movement is global and will continue regardless of whether Trump is reelected..  “Movements always rise and decline in terms of numbers on the ground,” he said..  Andy Koch, a 30-year-old nurse who lives in Chicago, has seen that ebb and flow firsthand. Koch has been active in protesting Trump’s policies even before he took office. When Koch was a student at University of Illinois at Chicago, Trump’s campaign canceled a 2016 speech at the campus following tense student protests..  Koch said the anti-Trump activism swelled when he first took office and again in early 2017 when he announced his first travel ban affecting people from several predominantly Muslim countries..  Roughly 1,000 people mobilized in Chicago immediately after Trump authorized the attack on the Iranian leader, and then the crowds subsided a few days later after the threat of war seemed to subside following Trump’s address to the nation Jan 8. That day, a few dozen — including Koch — showed up in 20-degree Fahrenheit (minus 7 Celsius) temperatures outside Trump International Hotel Chicago during rush hour..  Koch understands that masses of people won’t show up for every protest. “ What allows those numbers to come out … is continued organizing going on in between these events,” he said..  According to the Women’s March Chicago 2020 Facebook page, organizers will “spotlight several critical issues…in a block-by-block interactive experience,” including 2020 Census, climate justice, gun violence prevention, health care access, and voting..  According to Women’s March Chicago 2020 official site , the march “will be led by many our top elected women officials,” including: Illinois Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton, Congresswoman Robin Kelly, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Illinois Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, Illinois State Comptroller Susana Mendoza, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, City Clerk Anna Valencia, and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle..

342,"Chicagoans toughed out the cold yet again Saturday as thousands of protestors gathered at Grant Park (337 E. Randolph St.) for the third Chicago Women’s March..  The Chicago Women’s March is just part of the national movement of annual marches that began in 2017 as a response to Donald Trump’s election and subsequent inauguration. While the name suggests that the march may only focus on women, this is not the case. The national organization’s website states their mission is to fight for civil rights, disability rights, immigrant rights, LGBTQIA rights and worker’s rights, among other issues..  This year’s march focused on a variety of issues including the upcoming census, gun violence, climate change and healthcare. Signs representing each issue were littered throughout the crowd as the protestors made their way down Adams Street in the Loop. While these issues don’t just affect women, many of the signs in the crowd displayed how they can disproportionately affect women..  The march also honored female elected officials, with the Chicago Women’s March website listing Illinois Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle were among those designated as honorary “wayfinders” for the event, or those designated in the march to help marchers with disabilities..  These public figures led the march along with marchers with disabilities, who were part of the focus of this year’s march. Accessibility was heavily emphasized with the march having a dedicated entrance for marchers with disabilities and volunteers set aside to help them get through the march route..  Some Loyola students were at the march despite the morning drizzle and near-freezing temperatures. Mary Fletcher, a first-year student at Loyola studying exercise science, said she was the cold and rain weren’t an issue as she joined her friends for the march..  “I’m personally used to this weather,” Fletcher, 18, said. “It doesn’t really bother me at all and I’m all layered up so I think I’ll be fine.”.  Caity Hess, a first-year student at Loyola studying nursing, was part of Fletcher’s group of friends that attended the march together, departing from the Granville CTA Red Line station near Loyola’s Lake Shore Campus. They were just a few of the many marchers who took advantage of the increased Red Line service that occurred between 4:00 AM and 3:00 PM on the day of the march..  Hess said she was also unphased by the inclimate weather and joined her friends on their venture to Grant Park..  “I’ve never been to a march before so I wanted to experience it,” Hess, 19, said. “And I’m all about female empowerment… so we’ll brave through [the weather] together.” (Visited 24 times, 32 visits today)","[0.7909824848175049, 0.2090175300836563]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.7909824848175049

349,"At a virtual meeting of the City Club of Chicago, former White House chief of staff Sam Skinner, co-chair of Lightfoot’s economic recovery task force, confronted the issue of looting and public safety head-on. Sep 14, 2020, 5:28pm CDT Share this story Despite the pandemic and recent unrest and looting, Chicago remains poised for an economic recovery, two mayoral advisers are saying. Sun-Times file Chicago is poised for a comeback from the pandemic because of spending growth it has already seen after carefully managing its reopening, top mayoral advisors said Monday, even as they confronted the elephant in the room: downtown security. Deputy mayor for economic and neighborhood development Samir Mayekar and former White House chief of staff Sam Skinner were prime movers behind the roadmap to economic recovery released by Mayor Lori Lightfoot in early July . But, since that time, downtown Chicago, River North and Lincoln Park were hit by a second wave of looting more devastating than the first that, once again spread to commercial corridors on the South and West Sides. It shook peoples’ confidence in Chicago to the core and left downtown businesses and residents feeling unsafe. During a virtual appearance before the City Club of Chicago, Skinner didn’t wait to be asked about the second round of looting and the damage it did to Chicago’s ability to reverse population losses and attract second corporate headquarters. He anticipated the question and confronted it head-on. Related A new road map for Chicago proposes great destinations — but how do we get there? “I want to take another crack at a question I think will probably be coming. That’s safety and the violence that occurred. I want [you all] to know that the mayor addresses it as her No. 1 issue right now. To make sure that she is doing everything she can. Chicago Police Department, federal agents, local law enforcement throughout the region all working together,” Skinner said. “Some of this was very organized. It was organized criminal activity that took advantage of demonstrators and they’re gonna be dealt with. It is a top priority of the mayor right now. She’s on top of it. She’s bringing in the very best people that she can. Getting all the help she can from other places that have been through this. We recognize that’s an issue that’s on everybody’s mind.” Lightfoot’s $750 million Invest South/West plan to rebuild 10 impoverished inner-city neighborhoods will not come at the expense of downtown, Skinner insisted. “We’re committed to all of Chicago. There’s no one area that can get more attention than the other. Resources are limited. We’re spreading them as best we can,” Skinner said. Mayekar went further. “We’ve been tremendously focused on making sure that we keep downtown, that our commercial corridors are vibrant. But we have been just as focused on making sure that our neighborhood commercial corridors are safe. That they’re vibrant, that we’re promoting equity in how we distribute city resources,” he said. “We fundamentally reject that there’s a trade-off between downtown and the neighborhoods because we are absolutely in this together. The resource allocation and the focus of this administration, which is based on equity, recognizes that Invest South/West can be successful as can a plan to really ensure that downtown comes back from COVID even stronger.” The downtown workforce has been slow to return. Many businesses are allowing employees to work remotely until January. Others plan to wait until there’s a safe, widely-distributed vaccine. Asked about the future of downtown offices, Mayekar acknowledged companies “may not want to extend a lease” during this “time of crisis.” But they’re in no mood to cancel their leases, either. They’re in wait-and-see mode. “Many companies are looking to expand space. There was this trend [of] kind of cramming more people into an open office concept. You might see some trends away from that, given the challenges of the pandemic. But there’s this kind of acceptance of remote work and tele-work, which could lead to slightly more percentages of [people] working remotely,” he said. “But what we’ve heard is people do want to get back to the office. There’s an intangible benefit of being in-person. … The doom story of cities has been told many times over the course of the past few centuries. And cities have always been resilient. … We know those intangibles of being together and the importance of social interaction will be back one day.” Skinner served as U.S. transportation secretary under former President George H.W. Bush. He made no attempt to belittle the monumental challenge facing Chicago-based United Airlines, American Airlines and the other commercial carriers. That’s even though Mayekar said Lightfoot remains fully committed to the $8.7 billion O’Hare Airport expansion project she inherited from Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “The airlines are facing the biggest challenge in their history really. Bigger than they faced after 9/11, as big as that was,” Skinner said. “People aren’t traveling. They’re reluctant to travel. And capacity is at 10-to-15 or 20% of what it was.” Next Up In News","[0.5035791397094727, 0.49642083048820496]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5035791397094727

The police had been notified about the abortion by Henrietta's husband, Samuel, while she was on her deathbed. Henrietta admitted the abortion to the authorities and indicated that her husband had not known about it..  When police went to arrest Schott, they had to break into the home, and found Schott in the basement. She attacked the arresting officer, Captain Elbert O.

The final day to fill out 2020 Census information is September 30th. Morgan County, as of Thursday, was at a 69.6% response rate. Several municipalities are doing well, while others are below 70% self-response rates..  Kristin Jamison, President of the Jacksonville Regional Economic Development Corporation, says that Shawn Artis of the Morgan County GIS and a local volunteer are working on getting better responses in particular census tracts: “There’s a young woman from the Springfield area that has really been working on certain census tracts. She is working for a non-profit, and working to really [promote] the effort. I’ve worked to connect her with local aldermen and women in specific wards where the census tracts that maybe have a lower participation rate. I know that kind of boots-on-the-ground effort is happening. She has also been in contact with Shawn Artis, [Morgan County’s] GIS expert, to have those maps of the various census tracts that are under-performing. I know that the effort is there to make sure people are encouraged to reply the census.”.  Jamison says that South Jacksonville is the top responder in the county locally at 83.4%, and the City of Jacksonville lags at 66.1%. Delving into the numbers, Jamison says certain portions of the city are actually doing well compared to others: “It is interesting that South Jacksonville has a really high response rate. It is interesting if you go into various tracts within the City of Jacksonville. The city does have rates over 80% in particular tracts, and in one census tract is at 83.5%. Obviously, Jacksonville is a larger area than South Jacksonville, so there are pockets that are performing well. Unfortunately, there are also some other pockets that are under-performing and their response rates are more in the 50-60% range. There is one that has a 53.7% rate and another at 53.8%, so unfortunately they are bringing down that overall response rate for the city.”.

354,"Jan 06, 2020.  Does it feel like you have more elbow room lately? If you live in Illinois, that’s not your imagination playing tricks on you. People are leaving the state faster than people are arriving from other states, and newborns are not emerging frequently enough to make up the difference. In 2019, the U.S. Census Bureau calculates, our population fell by about 51,250 people. That’s the equivalent of everyone in Hoffman Estates packing up and heading out..  While the Land of Lincoln is experiencing a net outflow, other states are people magnets. Texas added some 367,215 residents last year — an average of more than 1,000 people every day. Florida grew by 233,420; Arizona by 120,693. Some of the transplants came from metropolitan Chicago and elsewhere in Illinois..  It’s not just the weather that attracts new residents. Minnesota has a climate even more challenging than Illinois’ — but it added some 33,383 people last year. If you like having slightly more breathing room in this state, you can be happy. If you like losing political power nationally, not so much..  Congressional seats are allocated to states based on how many inhabitants they have, as tabulated in the census every 10 years. As recently as the 1940s, Illinois had 27 U.S. House members. Today, it has just 18 — and commensurately less clout in Washington. After the 2020 census, it will have no more than 17, and could drop to 16. Texas, by contrast, could go from 36 to 38. Each state’s electoral votes in presidential elections will change accordingly..  That’s hardly the only downside for Illinois. Population loss means fewer taxpayers to cover the mountain of public pension obligations that are eating up so much of state and local budgets, and to fund public schools and universities, and to finance social welfare programs..  It means fewer customers to buy goods and services from stores and other providers, and fewer small business owners to hire young people out of high school or college. It means more parents and grandparents missing kids and grandkids who have migrated to Houston or Tampa in search of better opportunities..  You know what Texas and Florida can offer besides lots of warm weather? No personal income tax. You know what Illinois is considering? A graduated income tax, which would collect still more billions of tax dollars, hit the middle class eventually and invite more people to leave, while deterring big employers from locating here..  But just as the population growth Illinois once enjoyed was not an accident of nature but a product of human decisions, further decline here is not foreordained. Enacting better public policies that curb the growth of pension liabilities, easing tax burdens, facilitating new business formation and stimulating economic growth are four improvements perfectly capable of turning things around. If you can dig a hole, you can fill it in..  The past decade has been a bleak one for Illinois, and the 2020 census will almost certainly confirm that. But there’s another census in 2030.

356," Illinois red-light camera probe provides convincing evidence why they should be banned Chicago’s Northwest Side.  By John Ruberry.  There is a lot of red-light camera news in Illinois. As part of an overall corruption investigation in the state, federal authorities are into looking into the activities of Chicago firm, SafeSpeed, LLC, which installs red-light cameras in some Chicago suburbs..  Last week the mayor of west suburban Oakbrook Terrace, Tony Ragucci, resigned. He is part of that SafeSpeed probe. Federal agents have also have raided the municipal offices of the villages of McCook, Summit, and Lyons in conjunction with this investigation. A state senator who is part of the red-light camera probe, Martin Sandoval (D-Chicago) has since resigned..  Last year federal authorities seized $60,000 from Ragucci’s home, according to the Chicago Sun-Times , and $51,000 from a safe from Cook County Commissioner Jeffrey Tobolski’s residence. Tobolski is also the mayor of McCook..  SafeSpeed’s CEO denies any wrongdoing and no charges have been filed regarding the firm..  In 2017, the Forest Park Review called SafeSpeed a “clouted company.”.  Something stinks in Illinois. Actually, something new stinks in the state..  Red-light cameras are a cruel cash cow. At best their record in preventing accidents, the prima facie for them, is mixed as evidence shows out of fear of a $100 ticket–the charge in Illinois–motorists often abruptly slam on the brakes but then end up getting rear-ended..  As the nation’s most corrupt city, it shouldn’t be surprising that Chicago has more red-light cameras than any other municipality. Nor should it be surprising that it has endured a bribery scandal involving red-light cameras. John Bills, a former precinct captain in Michael Madigan’s political organization, is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence for accepting $2 million in bribes and gifts from a different red-light camera company, Redflex..  Madigan has been speaker of the Illinois House for thirty-five of the last thirty-seven years and he’s been the chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party since 1998..  Three paragraphs ago I called red light cameras a cruel cash cow . How much cash? From 2008 through 2018, drivers forked over $1 billion to municipalities. Not a major reason, but I suspect the proliferation of red-light cameras, most of which are concentrated in the Chicago area, as among the causes of Illinois’ six-years-and-counting population decline..  Here’s a personal take on red-light cameras. Thursday night Mrs. Marathon Pundit, who is a limousine driver, called me. “You have to pick me up at O’Hare Airport.” I replied, “Why?” She answered, “There is a boot on my limo.” Yes, one of those wheel boots. When I picked her up at O’Hare she supplied more details. “The city says there are four unpaid red-light tickets, two of them are from 2018, but the office says they were never told about them.”.  Okay, you may answer that one of her co-workers could be covering up inaction at the office. But in order for her employer to receive a city vehicle sticker for the limo she drives, all red-light camera tickets must be paid off. But the limo she drives has the latest Chicago vehicle sticker..  Those four tickets cost her employer $988, which included late charges and sending someone out to the car to remove the boot. Not knowing what was coming next, Mrs. Marathon Pundit parked her limo in a short-term lot, so her fee–which we have to pay–was a staggering $77. As it took all day Friday to sort out this debacle, my wife missed a day of work. She’s not on salary..  I’m certain hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans have similar stories. I just signed the law that bans red light cameras in Texas. #txlege pic.twitter.com/AyF28hxGwO — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) June 1, 2019.  There is some good news regarding red-light cameras. Last year Texas became the eighth state to abolish them. And in a rare bipartisan push, there is a movement in Illinois to ban them . And Illinois drivers now have a new friend, Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza. The Chicago Democrat says she’ll no longer assist municipalities in collecting red-light camera tickets. “As a matter of public policy, this system is clearly broken,” Mendoza said in a statement, “I am exercising the moral authority to prevent state resources from being used to assist a shady process that victimizes taxpayers.”.  Good for her..  Red-light cameras should be banned..  John Ruberry regularly blogs at Marathon Pundit.

By March 30, just under 40 percent of Illinois households had responded to the U.S. Census.

Mounia already had high blood pressure, but was now lethargic and having trouble breathing. She was put on a ventilator and died soon after. Doctors were never able to say what happened to her, according to her family, but Tariq El-Amin, Mounia’s brother-in-law, thinks it may have been an undiagnosed case of COVID-19..

362,"Chicago Auxilary Bishop Rojas Named Next SB Diocese Bishop Posted on by Venturi.  Pope Francis has named Bishop Alberto Rojas, who currently serves as an auxiliary bishop and Episcopal vicar for the Archdiocese of Chicago, to succeed San Bernardino Diocese Bishop Gerald Barnes. Rojas, who was born in El Zapote de la Labor, Mexico on January 5, 1965, will serve as coadjutor bishop with Barnes until Barnes’ 75th birthday next year, at which point Rojas will succeed him as bishop. The Diocese of San Bernardino was created in 1978 as an offshoot of the Diocese of San Diego. Geographically, it covers about 28,000 square miles and is the fifth largest diocese population-wise in the nation and the second largest in California after the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which is the largest in the country with roughly 5 million parishioners. The San Bernardino Diocese boasts one of the highest concentrations of Latinos in the United States. San Bernardino County at the time of the 2010 Census was 39.2 percent Hispanic. Latino numbers have grown since then, such that virtually half of the county’s residents are Hispanic. Catholicism is significant element of the culture in the footprint of the San Bernardino Diocese. Within it, which includes much of San Bernardino County and extends into Riverside County, roughly 38 percent of the population – 1.7 million – is Catholic. The diocese employs 151 priests to minister to the faithful. Rojas was named an auxiliary bishop of Chicago by Benedict XVI and ordained bishop there in August 2011. In Chicago he served under Cardinals Francis George and Blase Cupich. Rojas studied for the priesthood at Santa Maria de Guadalupe seminary in Aguascalientes, Mexico and at Mundelein Seminary in Illinois. He was ordained as a priest for the Archdiocese of Chicago in 1997, at the age of 32. As the Chicago Diocese’s auxiliary bishop, Rojas was Cardinal Francis George’s delegate for the archdiocesan Hispanic-American council and for both bishops George and Cupich he was the Hispanic-American council delegate, the liaison to Hispanic Catholics, a member of the U.S. bishops’ conference’s Hispanic Affairs Committee, and a regional liaison for the National V Encuentro of Hispanic and Latino Ministry. Rojas was also a member of the seminary formation faculty at Mundelein Seminary from 2002-2010. Barnes has headed the Diocese of San Bernardino for 23 years, and is now the longest serving bishop in the United States. Diocesan bishops are required by canonical law to submit upon achieving the age of 75 a resignation to the pope, who then has the discretion to accept or reject the resignation. Barnes turns 75 in June 2020. At a press conference to introduce Rojas to the community on Monday, Bishop Barnes said, “In church language we call this an episcopal transition. In layman’s terms, you might call it a changing of the guard.” Barnes said Rojas would become “the leader and shepherd of the diocese. It is with a great deal of gratitude to our Lord that I present to you our coadjutor bishop, Bishop Alberto Rojas. “My wish and hope is that we begin this journey united in the name of Jesus Christ, trusting in the spirit of the Holy Spirit to lead us in doing the will of God in our ministries,” Rojas said. “I thank God for the opportunity to serve him in this capacity and am also very grateful to the Holy Father, Pope Francis, for trusting in me for this service. With an open heart and mind, I’m looking forward to working with all of you, my brother priests especially, deacons religious men and women, the youth, young adults, the parish leaders, the ecclesial movements, and all the people of good will in the diocese.” ","[0.6079993844032288, 0.39200061559677124]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.6079993844032288

367,"Here's a look at what's happening with coronavirus developments in Central Illinois for today, Wednesday, April 29, 2020. THE DATA.  The Illinois Department of Public Health on Tuesday reported 144 new deaths from COVID-19 over the past 24 hours, the state’s highest one-day total. Those deaths push the state’s total over 2,000 to 2,125..  IDPH also reported 2,219 new cases of the disease, bringing that total to 48,102. Many of those patients have recovered, IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said..  Ezike said 49 percent of people surveyed who tested positive reported they were symptom-free two weeks after their positive test. For people between two and four weeks removed from their positive test, 61 percent felt recovered, while 74 percent who were more than four weeks from testing positive felt recovered..  “I hope that’s seen as encouraging news, that people do recover,” Ezike said..  Ezike added that as of Monday, 4,738 people in Illinois were hospitalized for COVID-19. Of those, 1,245 were in intensive care and 778 of those are on a ventilator..  Tuesday was also the fourth straight day that the state reported more than 10,000 tests over a 24-hour period after first reaching that daily milestone on Saturday.

Capitol News Illinois What Illinois state parks are reopening Friday? Here's the list. REACTION TO RULING.  Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday denounced a state representative from southern Illinois, calling the lawsuit that defeated his stay-at-home order in court “a cheap political stunt.”.  Referring to state Rep. Darren Bailey, R-Xenia, only as “the state representative from the 109th district,” Pritzker said Bailey’s successful lawsuit in Clay County circuit court on Monday was “designed so that the representative can see his name in headlines.”.  “This ruling only applies to one person because it was only ever about one person,” Pritzker said during his daily COVID-19 briefing in Chicago..  A judge ruled Monday that the governor’s extended 30-day stay-at-home order cannot apply to Bailey. Pritzker said that decision sets “a dangerous precedent.”.  “Slowing the spread of this virus is critical to saving lives by insuring our health care system has the resources to treat patients who get sick,” he said. “And we will not stop this virus if because of this ruling any resident can petition to be exempted from aspects of the orders that rely on collective action to keep us all safe.”.  Pritzker, via Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, will appeal that ruling because “the state has acted well within its legal authority to protect the health of the public,” he said..  The governor added later in the briefing that “it is the history of the state of Illinois that we have sometimes successive declarations of disaster,” such as after floods..  “Pandemics don't live by a 30-day timeframe,” he said..  Bailey’s district includes Jasper County, which has the third-highest COVID-19 infection rate in the state — 44 cases among 9,610 residents, according to a Capitol News Illinois calculation using 2019 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates..  Pritzker also said Bailey’s House district “happens to have among the lowest hospital bed availability and ventilators in the state, making it uniquely ill equipped to respond to a surge in cases.”.

368,"0 THE DATA.  The Illinois Department of Public Health on Tuesday reported 144 new deaths from COVID-19 over the past 24 hours, the state’s highest one-day total. Those deaths push the state’s total over 2,000 to 2,125..  IDPH also reported 2,219 new cases of the disease, bringing that total to 48,102. Many of those patients have recovered, IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said..  Ezike said 49 percent of people surveyed who tested positive reported they were symptom-free two weeks after their positive test. For people between two and four weeks removed from their positive test, 61 percent felt recovered, while 74 percent who were more than four weeks from testing positive felt recovered..  “I hope that’s seen as encouraging news, that people do recover,” Ezike said..  Ezike added that as of Monday, 4,738 people in Illinois were hospitalized for COVID-19. Of those, 1,245 were in intensive care and 778 of those are on a ventilator..  Tuesday was also the fourth straight day that the state reported more than 10,000 tests over a 24-hour period after first reaching that daily milestone on Saturday. IDPH reported 14,561 newly completed tests on Tuesday, brining that total to 242,189, which is about 2 percent of Illinois’ population..  The deaths are: Cook County: 1 female 20s, 1 male 20s, 2 males 30s, 3 males 40s, 2 females 50s, 6 males 50s, 10 females 60s, 17 males 60s, 11 females 70s, 17 males 70s, 17 females 80s, 15 males 80s, 5 females 90s, 6 males 90s DuPage County: 1 male 60s, 1 female 70s, 1 male 70s, 1 female 80s, 1 male 80s, 1 female 90s Jefferson County: 1 female 90s Kane County: 1 female 80s, 1 female 90s Kankakee County: 1 male 50s Lake County: 1 male 40s, 2 females 70s, 2 males 70s, 1 male 80s Madison County: 1 female 50s McHenry County: 2 females 70s Ogle County: 1 male 70s Rock Island County: 1 female 90s St. Clair County: 1 female 90s Will County: 1 female teens, 1 male 50s, 1 female 60s, 2 males 70s, 2 males 80s, 1 female 90s Winnebago County: 1 female 80s.  Capitol News Illinois What Illinois state parks are reopening Friday? Here's the list. REACTION TO RULING.  Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday denounced a state representative from southern Illinois, calling the lawsuit that defeated his stay-at-home order in court “a cheap political stunt.”.  Referring to state Rep. Darren Bailey, R-Xenia, only as “the state representative from the 109th district,” Pritzker said Bailey’s successful lawsuit in Clay County circuit court on Monday was “designed so that the representative can see his name in headlines.”.  “This ruling only applies to one person because it was only ever about one person,” Pritzker said during his daily COVID-19 briefing in Chicago..  A judge ruled Monday that the governor’s extended 30-day stay-at-home order cannot apply to Bailey. Pritzker said that decision sets “a dangerous precedent.”.  “Slowing the spread of this virus is critical to saving lives by insuring our health care system has the resources to treat patients who get sick,” he said. “And we will not stop this virus if because of this ruling any resident can petition to be exempted from aspects of the orders that rely on collective action to keep us all safe.”.  Pritzker, via Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, will appeal that ruling because “the state has acted well within its legal authority to protect the health of the public,” he said..  The governor added later in the briefing that “it is the history of the state of Illinois that we have sometimes successive declarations of disaster,” such as after floods..  “Pandemics don't live by a 30-day timeframe,” he said..  Bailey’s district includes Jasper County, which has the third-highest COVID-19 infection rate in the state — 44 cases among 9,610 residents, according to a Capitol News Illinois calculation using 2019 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates..  Pritzker also said Bailey’s House district “happens to have among the lowest hospital bed availability and ventilators in the state, making it uniquely ill equipped to respond to a surge in cases.”.  Pritzker cited a poll published by Illinois political blog Capitol Fax that found 77 percent of people at least somewhat approve of the current stay-at-home order and 71 percent at least somewhat approve of how the governor has handled the outbreak..  “I don't think there's a partisan divide.

For now, Pritzker said Wednesday the Illinois Department of Public Health “has secured a special contract with Quest Diagnostics to run 3000 tests per day from Illinois long-term care facilities at no cost to the facilities. And has promised to provide results in a 48-hour window” As for a possible strike next week by nursing home workers. Pritzker said, “We cannot let our seniors down. We cannot let people in our long-term care facilities down. It’s too important.” Pritzker urged the two sides to get bargaining and get a deal done..

Type your search term above Student-based budgeting here to stay, Chicago schools chief says By: Ariana Fine | April 29, 2020.  A school funding formula first introduced under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel and since adjusted under new schools leadership is here to stay, the Chicago Public Schools CEO said Tuesday, despite calls for changes from the teachers union, activists and parents at six public meetings held this winter to discuss the issue..  The way the district allocates dollars to its 514 schools has long been under the microscope as a potential source of deepening inequity at CPS. Schools in low-income neighborhoods that have seen population loss are hurt financially by factors outside their control under a funding formula that takes away money from a school when students leave. Mayor Lori Lightfoot campaigned on finding a better way to give schools the resources they need..  Schools chief Janice Jackson said Tuesday that modifications can still be made, but she believes the basis of the current formula — called “student-based budgeting” and directly tied to student enrollment — is the most equitable available.","[0.6911755800247192, 0.30882441997528076]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6911755800247192

375,"By Orphe Divounguy and Bryce Hill | Feb 28, 2020.  While Gov. J.B. Pritzker lauded his first year as a success for the state’s labor market, his priority “fair tax” proposal would more than erase his year of jobs gains and set back the state’s economy..  Illinois gained 45,000 jobs in 2019, a sluggish rate compared with the national average. If voters on Nov. 3 pass Pritzker’s signature policy proposal, a progressive state income tax he dubbed the “fair tax,” last year’s jobs gains would be more than wiped out. Illinois would lose 56,366, according to an analysis by the Illinois Policy Institute..  Pritzker touted job gains during his state of the state address. In reality, Illinois’ jobs market endured another sluggish year in 2019. The state added just 45,000 jobs (+0.7%), a rate that was half the national average of 1.4%. And despite Pritzker’s claim that all areas of the state are growing simultaneously, three metro areas experienced a decline in the number of jobs in their economies and seven other metro areas were below the national average. This poor jobs performance came as Illinois suffered its sixth consecutive year of population decline in 2019..  Additionally, the state’s unemployment rate – while reaching historic lows in 2019 – remains higher than the national average and those of most neighboring states. The rate has actually been the byproduct of a declining labor force rather than employment gains..  Now, Illinois’ fragile labor market is at even further risk of deteriorating, as lawmakers are asking voters to approve a $3.7 billion progressive income tax hike this November. The decision to scrap the state’s constitutionally protected flat income tax in favor of a progressive income tax would wreak havoc on the state’ s economy, resulting in an estimated 56,366 (-0.71%) fewer jobs – more than the entire Decatur metro area, which sustains 52,500 jobs – over the long run (see Appendix)..  The lost jobs from the progressive income tax would be more than all of the job gains posted in 2019..  Because the tax increase would hurt the economy and yield less revenue than expected, the progressive income tax would likely result in far higher taxes on middle-class Illinoisans, causing even more disastrous effects..  Illinois’ labor market is in desperate need of a jump start. Pursuing more tax hikes won’t boost jobs growth. Instead, the state needs to pursue long-lasting reforms, such as constitutional pension reform. It needs to tie growth in state spending to what Illinois taxpayers can afford, such as growth in state gross domestic product or personal income. Texas and Tennessee have implemented similar spending restrictions, and both have budget surpluses, no state income tax and lower property tax rates than Illinois.

376,"White Sox vs. Athletics: Game 2 Live Blog The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office has approved felony animal cruelty charges against the man known as the “Dreadhead Cowboy” after he rode a horse down the Dan Ryan Expressway on Monday afternoon. NBC 5's Natalie Martinez has all the latest details on the case..  Authorities had previously said he was charged with misdemeanors including reckless conduct, disobeying a police officer, criminal trespass to state-supported property, obstruction of traffic, and operating a non-highway-vehicle on a highway in connection with the incident on Sept. 21..  Officials say Hollingsworth rode his horse onto the Dan Ryan Expressway just after 4 p.m. on Sept. 21, conducting a Facebook Live broadcast while on the highway, shouting “kids lives matter” as he rode the horse along the expressway. He was flanked by numerous motorcycles and other vehicles, and traffic was backed up as a result of the incident..  Eventually he exited the highway at 95 th Street, and he was taken into custody. The man dubbed the ""Census Cowboy"" took his horse down Chicago's Dan Ryan Expressway Monday afternoon during rush hour..  The horse suffered a bloody wound on one of its hooves and appeared to have sores on its sides from the saddled, officials said. It placed in the custody of Chicago Animal Care and Control..  Prosecutors on Wednesday said the horse, later transferred to the care of a stable, is in critical condition and may have to be euthanized as a result of its injuries..  During Hollingsworth’s court appearance, prosecutors cited a veterinarian who testified that the damage the horse’s body sustained from the ride is equivalent to what would happen if an 80-year-old were forced to run a full marathon.

378,"What would be the most honorable, selfless act an Illinois elected official might consider? Probably this: To acknowledge the state’s financial woes and, in the name of overburdened taxpayers, fire oneself..  To say publicly what no fiefdom-building politician ever wants to admit: My city and state would be better off without me and my expensive, wasteful bureaucracy..  Go ahead and roll your eyes, but then applaud Mayor Curtis McCall Jr. of Cahokia near St. Louis, who declares that residents really would benefit if his village along the Mississippi River combined with two nearby communities. “I would have to step down from my position as a mayor, and that wasn’t an easy choice to make because I love serving the citizens in the village of Cahokia,” he said, according to the Belleville News-Democrat. “It wasn’t an easy decision to make, but it was a necessary decision to make.”.  The idea of consolidating and eliminating units of government in Illinois is the long-standing wish of infuriated watchdogs and exhausted taxpayers. This state has more government units than any other: nearly 7,000 of them, including villages, townships, housing authorities and drainage districts. Every one takes its share of dollars from you, the taxpayers. Many of these taxing bodies operate without much scrutiny and offer services that could be handled by others. Many provide taxpayer-funded pensions..  At the same time, Illinois is losing population as residents leave for other states with brighter economic opportunities, lower taxes, less corruption and sometimes, yes, warmer weather. We hear frequently from Illinois Exodus seekers and other fed-up residents who fear the downward spiral’s impact. At both the state and local levels, Illinois is deep in debt, yet government entities continue to tax and spend at unsustainable levels. As more Illinoisans leave, and others choose not to come, the burdens rise on those who remain..  Fleeing is always an option. “I’m tired of Illinois’ multiple levels of corrupt government and out-of-control spending,” Tribune reader Kevin Bae of Glenview wrote in a recent letter to the editor in which he said goodbye. “People here scream for change but vote the same people into office time and time again.”.  Two other recent letter-writers focused their attention on government spending, offering specific suggestions for downsizing expensive bureaucracies. Jack Shniderman of Northbrook looked at a map and wondered why Illinois has 102 counties and a population of 12.7 million, while California has 58 counties and a population of 39.5 million. “Like a business merger, if Illinois merged down to 40 or 50 counties, it would save billions by eliminating redundancies in workers, equipment, pensions, elections, transportation and hundreds of other expenses,” he wrote..  A Facebook page “Escaping Illinois” boasts nearly 50,000 followers and sells T-shirts, coffee mugs, baby onesies and other merchandise. Its posts often lament the state’s bleak finances..  Kathleen Reyes of Chicago took aim at the 50-member City Council. “Most aldermen have staffs of six to eight employees,” she wrote. “We’d save a fortune on salaries and benefits by cutting the City Council to 25 and cutting staffs to a reasonable number.”.  Idealistic? Improbable? Say what you want, but these are necessary changes for a state not living within its means. As Illinois’ fiscal plight deepens, there’s been some nibbling around the edges of reform. The state recently consolidated hundreds of downstate and suburban police and fire pension funds into two statewide funds. McHenry County and DuPage County have made progress toward dissolving smaller governments within their boundaries..  Then there is what Mayor McCall of Cahokia and other realists are doing along the Mississippi River. On Election Day Nov. 3, the voters of Cahokia, Centreville and Alorton will decide whether to merge into one city. The survivor community would be called Cahokia Heights. Afterward, a local township might also be dissolved. The area is losing population and has a high percentage of residents living below the federal poverty line, the News-Democrat said. Consolidating government would save tax dollars and allow the larger community to qualify for more federal funds..  “If it’s going to help the residents of Cahokia, Centreville or Alorton, then I’m all for it because right now, our communities are dying,” McCall said. “These are communities of color and we need to do what we need to do to help these communities survive.”.  Thank you, mayor, for doing what every elected government official in troubled Illinois, should be doing every day: Caring about people and responsible governance, not political fiefdoms..  Say goodbye, we hope, to Cahokia, Centreville and Alorton. Hello to Cahokia Heights and fiscal responsibility..

379,"Chicago named most welcoming U.S. city for immigrants, Detroit comes in 14th overall Posted: Thursday 12.26.2019 5:49 pm Nick Meyer COMMUNITY.  CHICAGO — Detroit is the 14th most welcoming city for immigrants in the United States, according to a list of rankings compiled by New American Economy, a bipartisan research group dedicated to comprehensive immigration reform..  Chicago came in number one in this year’s rankings of 100 cities, followed by Chula Vista, California, Jersey City and San Francisco..  “We are tremendously proud Chicago has been named the most welcoming city in America for immigrants and refugees,” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement. “This ranking reflects the passionate and dedicated work of countless public officials and community members across our city who have come together to stand up and fight for the rights of our immigrant and refugee communities, no matter the cost.”.  The rankings are based off of New American Economy’s Cities Index, which takes into account 51 different factors including a city’s language access policies, employment and home ownership rates, an article from USA Today said. New American Economy was founded in 2010 by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, media mogul Rupert Murdoch and other corporate executives as an organization dedicated to preventing illegal immigration while creating more opportunities for immigrants to join the U.S. workforce and build a path to legal status for all undocumented immigrants..  Chicago took the number one spot in large part because the city has created an inclusive legal environment and has taken up policies supporting undocumented immigrants and DACA recipients, said Andrew Lim, Director of Quantitative Research at New American Economy..  Immigrants make up more than one-fifth of Chicago’s population according to city estimates. In 2016, immigrants held nearly a quarter of the spending power among the city’s residents and earned nearly $17 billion in household income. But the city came up short on providing access to affordable housing and income equality, the organization said..  Midwestern cities including Detroit were widely represented inside the top 20. Cleveland, Milwaukee and Toledo are among those whose scores improved the most from last year..  “Midwestern cities are really proactive on this issue,” Lim said. “A lot of that has to do with their own economic development plans. A lot of cities in the Midwest have struggled with population loss, so they’re really encouraging people to stay in these cities or to come from afar to help them bounce back.”.  In Detroit, the immigrant population has grown by more than 8 percent, or 3,000 immigrant residents, from 2013 when current mayor Mike Duggan was elected through 2017..

380,"Will Illinois’ population continue to shrink? Posted on December 27, 2019 If the losses are significant, Illinois could see a net loss of population for the entire decade, something Harger says has never happened in the state. (Photo by Doug Kerr/flickr).  SPRINGFIELD – Illinoisans will soon find out if the state’s population has continued to decline. The U.S. Census is scheduled to release its annual population estimates Dec. 30 for the 12 months that ended in July 2019. This estimate will be the final one before the federal agency begins its ten-year count next spring. Last year, Illinois became the sixth most populous state, losing an estimated 45,000 people and falling behind Pennsylvania. “My expectation is that it will probably continue the trend that we’ve had for most of the decade,” said Brian Harger, research specialist with Northern Illinois University’s Center for Governmental Studies. “We will probably show another loss in population.” If Illinois’ population for 2019 is significant, it could mean the state would have an unprecedented net loss in total population from 2010 to 2020, Harger said. Population losses come with a myriad of financial implications for Illinois officials. Many federal grants and other assistance is calculated based on population. Fewer people buying homes could lower property values, pushing property taxes higher. Companies seeking to relocate or expand in a state often view population loss as a negative quality because a growing business needs new workers. After reapportionment in 2021, Illinois will likely lose at least one congressional seat because the seats are based on population. “A lot of federal programs use Census-driven formulas for allocating funding to the states,” Harger said. “That loss of population will impact us there.” The argument over who, and especially why, people are leaving Illinois in such numbers often turns political . Some groups have downplayed the losses, noting that Illinois is one of the nation’s most populated states and that the yearly losses have been going on for decades. Others have blamed the state’s high taxes for sending residents to find greener pastures, often fighting the “it’s just retirees going to Florida” argument with IRS data showing more people move to neighboring states than uproot to the Sunshine State. Polling by Southern Illinois University has suggested that high taxes get people thinking about leaving the state, but while many think about leaving, far fewer actually do so. A 2015 SIU poll found that half of the Illinois residents surveyed would leave the state if they could. The No. 1 reason was taxes. One troubling aspect of the annual population loss is the characteristics of who is leaving, youth and working-age professionals, per Census data. Illinois’ population losses have been primarily attributed to people younger than 65. Nearly every age bracket from children under five to adults age 55-60 declined. The largest total population decrease was among Illinoisans age 50-54, which fell by an estimated 25,313 people..

Posted on December 27, 2019 If the losses are significant, Illinois could see a net loss of population for the entire decade, something Harger says has never happened in the state. (Photo by Doug Kerr/flickr).  SPRINGFIELD – Illinoisans will soon find out if the state’s population has continued to decline. The U.S. Census is scheduled to release its annual population estimates Dec. 30 for the 12 months that ended in July 2019. This estimate will be the final one before the federal agency begins its ten-year count next spring. Last year, Illinois became the sixth most populous state, losing an estimated 45,000 people and falling behind Pennsylvania. “My expectation is that it will probably continue the trend that we’ve had for most of the decade,” said Brian Harger, research specialist with Northern Illinois University’s Center for Governmental Studies. “We will probably show another loss in population.” If Illinois’ population for 2019 is significant, it could mean the state would have an unprecedented net loss in total population from 2010 to 2020, Harger said. Population losses come with a myriad of financial implications for Illinois officials. Many federal grants and other assistance is calculated based on population. Fewer people buying homes could lower property values, pushing property taxes higher. Companies seeking to relocate or expand in a state often view population loss as a negative quality because a growing business needs new workers. After reapportionment in 2021, Illinois will likely lose at least one congressional seat because the seats are based on population. “A lot of federal programs use Census-driven formulas for allocating funding to the states,” Harger said. “That loss of population will impact us there.” The argument over who, and especially why, people are leaving Illinois in such numbers often turns political . Some groups have downplayed the losses, noting that Illinois is one of the nation’s most populated states and that the yearly losses have been going on for decades. Others have blamed the state’s high taxes for sending residents to find greener pastures, often fighting the “it’s just retirees going to Florida” argument with IRS data showing more people move to neighboring states than uproot to the Sunshine State. Polling by Southern Illinois University has suggested that high taxes get people thinking about leaving the state, but while many think about leaving, far fewer actually do so. A 2015 SIU poll found that half of the Illinois residents surveyed would leave the state if they could. The No. 1 reason was taxes. One troubling aspect of the annual population loss is the characteristics of who is leaving, youth and working-age professionals, per Census data. Illinois’ population losses have been primarily attributed to people younger than 65. Nearly every age bracket from children under five to adults age 55-60 declined. The largest total population decrease was among Illinoisans age 50-54, which fell by an estimated 25,313 people..

385,"Step-by-step Guide In Starting A Business In Chicago By tweet Photo: R boed, www.travelmag.com.  Chicago is the most populated city in Illinois. According to the 2018 Census, the city’s estimated population reached 2,705,994, making it the third most populated metropolis in the entire US. People in and around the city opt to reside here due to its massive employment opportunities. The city has the reputation of being an international finance and technology hub in the country..  Due to its large labor pool composed of at least 4.63 million workers, more businesses continue to look for office space in Chicago to establish their companies. If you plan to try your business’s luck in the city, here is a step-by-step guide to thriving in the Windy City..  Step 1: Pick You Business Entity.  You and your business attorney and CPA must decide on the right entity for your business. You may either want to run a sole proprietorship if you are the only owner of the company. If you plan to manage the company with a partner, you can look into different types of business partnerships like general partnerships where each partner needs to agree on major decisions..  You may also choose limited organizations where the general partners manage the daily operation of the business. In contrast, limited partners put their investments in the company without any decision-making powers. Other types of partnerships include limited liability partnerships and qualified joint ventures..  Step 2: Register Your Business With The IRS.  Before looking for office space in Chicago, all businesses operating in Chicago must have an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS. It is generally known as the Federal Tax ID Number. To help you understand how to register the business in the city, you can visit the IRS website. Better yet, you can visit the agency’s office located at 230 S. Dearborn..  Step 3: Register With IDOR.  Businesses operating in Chicago and the entire state of Illinois must register their operation with the Illinois Department of Revenue (IDOR). It means that all types of enterprises, including retail, wholesale, manufacturing, or services must secure their permit from this agency. You can get your IDOR Account ID through their website to fill-up and download the REG-1 form then mail it to the designated address found on the form. You may also call 800-356-6302 to get more information or drop by the Chicago Office at 100 W. Randolph..  Step 4: Acquire A Chicago Business License.  To fully operate in the city, you need to get a business license at the Small Business Centre located in Room 800 in 121 N. Lasalle. You need to fill up a Business Information Sheet to get a business license. Information that you must indicate in your application form includes your business name and other ownership information, the address where you plan to hold office, and a thorough description of your business activity. You may also include your EIN, IDOR Account ID number, and your file number from the State of Illinois..  These are the detailed steps when planning to start a business in Chicago. By complying with these instructions, you can get the assurance that your company will run smoothly. It will also let you avoid any problems with the law since you followed all the legal requirements for operating your new company in Chicago.

389,"Link.  Evanston will use recreational marijuana sales tax proceeds to fund local reparations program.  By GENEVIEVE BOOKWALTER.  PIONEER PRESS.  NOV 27, 2019.  Evanston aldermen on Monday approved directing all sales tax revenue collected from recreational marijuana purchases to a fund that will establish a local reparations program..  Officials say the program will help the city’s black population stay in Evanston while also providing training for jobs and other benefits..  “We can implement funding to directly invest in black Evanston,” said Ald. Robin Rue Simmons, 5th Ward, who proposed the reparations bill..  While Evanston officials have voted to permit, tax and appropriate money from recreational marijuana sales, many other suburbs have voted not to allow recreational marijuana dispensaries to open when the businesses become legal next year under state law..  Evanston leaders say they see the dispensaries as an opportunity to pay for a local reparations program that would address the lingering institutional effects of slavery and discrimination. The proposal passed 8-1, with Ald. Tom Suffredin, 6th Ward, voting against it..  Simmons said the source of the money was especially appropriate, as many black residents were victims of the “war on drugs” and spent time in jail for smoking marijuana, a substance that in specific quantities will now be permitted in Illinois..  The tax on marijuana will “be invested in the community it unfairly policed and damaged,” Simmons said..  A committee of residents is currently examining ways to spend the money and how to best support the black community through housing, education and economic incentives. The fund will be capped at $10 million, according to city of Evanston staff reports. City estimates project the marijuana tax could generate $500,000 to $750,000 per year..  “This is a really special moment in the city of Evanston and also in the country,” said Ald. Peter Braithwaite, 2nd Ward..  Community members attending the meeting praised the effort and thanked the council for investing in residents who were harmed by discriminatory housing and other past policies..  “I support the approval of the ordinance for the city of Evanston to commit all of the anticipated tax revenue from the recreational marijuana businesses, to support work aimed at intentionally repairing harms done to the black community from policies and practices in so many different areas,” said Oliver Ruff, a retired teacher and Evanston resident..  Simmons’ proposal came as Evanston’s black population decreased from 22.5% of the population in 2000 to 16.9% in 2017, according to U.S. Census data..

391,"Last week, city council members in Evanston, Illinois voted to use marijuana sales tax revenue towards a fund meant to provide reparations to its Black community..  The city council voted 8 to 1 to institute a three percent tax on cannabis sales. The first $10 million generated over the next 10 years will go towards a plan to provide financial resources to Black individuals for a variety of uses. The plan is forecasted to generate between $500,000 and $750,000 a year, and the fund for reparations will also be open to other kinds of donations..  The plan is a multi-faceted strategy to combat the variety of issues facing Evanston’s Black community, which has also had to battle historic redlining practices, in addition to high rates of property tax and racist lending practices..  “This is something radical to preserve the Black population,” said Robin Rue Simmons to the Washington Post of the reparations fund. Simmons is an alderman from Evanston’s Fifth Ward, which has been home to a large segment of its Black residents..  “Our community was damaged due to the war on drugs and marijuana convictions. This is a chance to correct that,” she said. “Our disadvantage and discrimination has continued beyond outlawing Jim Crow and beyond enslavement.”.  Simmons said the fund will entail direct financial support to Black individuals and families in matters like subsidizing down payments on a home, technical training for job seekers, and home repairs for long-term property owners..  Details of the plan will be hammered out at a town hall meeting on December 11..  The sole dissenting vote on the fund from alderman Thomas Suffredin was based on the perceived ambiguity of the fund. “In a town full of financial needs and obligations, I believe it is bad policy to dedicate tax revenue from a particular source, in unknown annual amounts, to a purpose that has yet to be determined,” he wrote in a newsletter. A Continuing Effort to Mitigate Racial Disparity.  An analysis of police activity over 36 months found that 71 percent of people arrested in Evanston were Black and 57 percent of citations went to Black residents — even though they only comprise 16.9 percent of the town’s population, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data..  It’s not the first time that Evanston has opted to support efforts towards reparations. In 2002, its council unanimously approved plans to fund a federal investigation into reparations. The council has also created a position for a chief equity officer, as well as establishing a commission on equity and empowerment..  The plan is based on a provision built into the legislation that regulated cannabis in the state this summer, which prioritized social equity measures for individuals who had been unjustly targeted by war on drugs policing. On a state level, that measure has translated into a system that prioritizes cannabis entrepreneurs of color, plus those who live in a geographic area that saw heightened levels of drug war police activity..  Evanston is currently home to a sole medical marijuana dispensary, which will transition to become a recreational store on January 1 when Illinois’ legalization takes effect. If all goes according to plan, the business will fund a reparations plan that could prove influential for other Illinois towns and jurisdictions beyond state lines..  “There’s been nothing in place for black people that have been discriminated against in Evanston,” Simmons said. “Reparations is long overdue for the community. It’s long overdue for Black people in the United States.”","[0.5077979564666748, 0.4922020733356476]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5077979564666748
392,"The first-of-its-kind initiative is an effort to keep more black residents in Evanston, and to start righting the wrongs of slavery, the War on Drugs, and centuries of racist persecution..  Image via.  A landmark social equity program was approved in Evanston, Illinois late last week, establishing the nation’s first reparations program for black residents funded directly by legal weed taxes..  The new tax directive will funnel all of Evanston’s legal cannabis tax money to programs that will directly support the city’s black residents and repair centuries of racism dating back to the slave trade and continuing through institutional racism and policies like the War on Drugs. According to the Chicago Tribune , Evanston Aldermen approved the citywide ordinance 8-1..  “We can implement funding to directly invest in black Evanston,” Alderwoman Robin Rue Simmons, who proposed the reparations bill, told the Tribune , noting that the Chicago suburb’s expected $500,000 to $750,000 in annual cannabis tax revenue will “be invested in the community it unfairly policed and damaged.”.  While a number of Illinois’s small towns and suburbs have “opted out” of legalization by blocking dispensaries from popping up after next month’s recreational cannabis sales start, Evanston has taken the opposite approach and welcomed pot shops with open arms. And when tax cash starts rolling in from those dispensaries next month , Rue Simmons said that the reparations programs will be especially appropriate considering the history of racist marijuana policing in Evanston and beyond..  “This is a really special moment in the city of Evanston and also in the country,” Alderman Peter Braithwaite said..  Since the year 2000, Evanston has seen a significant decrease in black residents, from 22.5 percent of census respondents at the turn of the millenium to only 16.9 percent in 2017. It has not yet been decided how the money from the city’s new reparations program will be spent, but Rue Simmons and others suggested the funds could be used to reign in soaring housing costs, or to support local education, or economic programs..  “We are on the right track,” Alderwoman Ann Rainey told the Tribune ..

City of Evanston staff revealed the fund will have a $10 million cap with a possible annual revenue of $500,000 to $750,000 generated from marijuana tax..  The program will take effect in 2020 when the sale of recreational marijuana to adults in the state of Illinois officially becomes legal . Though the city has opted to legalize and generate revenue from the sale of recreational marijuana, several other suburbs have chosen not to..  According to city officials, the reparations program is meant to atone for the persistent institutional setbacks of slavery as well as discrimination against blacks..  Simmons, who proposed the bill, said the source of the revenue was justified, especially as some of the city’s black residents, as a result of the state’s “war on drugs”, were convicted for smoking marijuana prior to its recreational legalization, the Chicago Tribune further reports..  She added that the revenue will “be invested in the community it unfairly policed and damaged.”.  A committee has already been set up to explore how the funds will be disbursed and how it will benefit the city’s black residents through housing, education and economic incentives..  “I support the approval of the ordinance for the city of Evanston to commit all of the anticipated tax revenue from the recreational marijuana businesses, to support work aimed at intentionally repairing harms done to the black community from policies and practices in so many different areas,” an Evanston resident said..  Attitudes towards reparations for slavery in the United States tend to polarise the country, with whites highly against it while blacks tend to support the initiative. Those who support reparations say it is necessary to help redress the wrongs of slavery and racial discrimination..

399,"If Snoop Dogg moved to this place, he could double-dip by selling his brand of weed then getting some cash for reparations..  As Illinois prepares to legalize recreational marijuana use in the New Year, a plan is being hashed out in Evanston, IL, to use a portion of the tax revenue from the sale of cannabis products to fund race-based reparations to black residents. Three percent of the tax revenue will be used to fund reparations for African American residents of Evanston for the next 10 years and cap the funding at $10 million..  The Evanston city council passed the measure 8-1 on November 25..  The marijuana tax is expected to raise between $500,000 to $700,000 per year..  Trending: WATCH: Biden Would Hate If We All Shared This Animation Mocking His ‘Hairy Leg’ Speech.  According to U.S. Census Bureau Data from 2018, 16.9 percent of residents of Evanston, an affluent North Shore suburb of Chicago and the location of Northwestern University, identify as black. This is down from 22.5 percent in 2000. Evanston has one of the largest black communities in the metro area..  “Our community was damaged due to the war on drugs and marijuana convictions. This is a chance to correct that,” Robin Rue Simmons, a black alderman who represents the city’s historically black Fifth Ward, told The Washington Post. “Our disadvantage and discrimination has continued beyond outlawing Jim Crow and beyond enslavement.”.  Simmons added, “This is something radical to preserve the black population and let the black community know that we see the flight.”.  But the city’s reparations plan will benefit not only victims of the war on drugs. Rather, it focuses on all African American residents, who Simmons said have suffered from the city’s history of redlining and, more recently, from the recession and foreclosure crisis. As black Evanstonians are pushed out by high property taxes and predatory lending practices, the reparations plan looks to give them the money to keep living and working in the lakefront suburb, about 14 miles north of downtown Chicago..  The plan stems from the idea that African Americans should disproportionately benefit from the sale of cannabis, Simmons said, because they have been disproportionately affected by the policing of marijuana — both nationally and locally. In the past three years, nearly three-quarters of those arrested on marijuana possession charges in Evanston were African American, according to city officials..  The plan to pay reparations is controversial for several reasons:.  1. The individuals who are being paid were not enslaved themselves and those paying did not enslave anyone..  2. How do you determine who gets reparations? Do you exclude blacks who are not descended from slaves?.  3. What about those who are descended from slaves who are not black?.  4. What about those who are descended from black slave owners like Kamala Harris is?.  5. What about African Americans who are successful despite the legacy of Jim Crow and racism? Would Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas receive reparations if he lived in Evanston? How about Condoleeza Rice, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Maxine Waters, or Ben Carson? What about former Chicago residents like Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and Kanye West? Do any of them get reparations?.  6. What role do personal choices play in success and failure?.  7. What role do leftist governance and the systemic destruction of the black family play in achievement gaps?.  In the WaPo piece, Simmons doesn’t address these problems with reparations, instead, she is blaming any disparity on racism..  Simmons says that reparations are needed because racism and the legacy of Jim Crow have kept black residents from achievement. “This is in response to the continued impact of Jim Crow. From the war on drugs, to mass incarceration, to the academic gap, the wealth divide, the opportunity gap, the achievement gap. It is all based on race.”.  She believes that the money raised shouldn’t be used for programs in black communities, but direct payments to all black residents provided that they meet residency requirements..  Simmons said she wants reparations to take the form of direct payments to black residents, rather than “another diversity policy” that might fund a program or pay a third-party organization to carry out a service..  For example, a black family that’s looking to purchase a home and qualifies for credit might receive help on a down payment they otherwise couldn’t afford, she said. An African American resident who wants to beef up their résumé could get a stipend for technical training. And a black family that has owned a house in Evanston for generations might have their repairs paid for by the city..  It seems to me that earmarking tax revenue for direct payments to certain residents who meet a race and residency requirement in an attempt to fight racism is racist in itself..  There are obviously some wrinkles that need to be ironed out..

405,"Even without a constitutional amendment, there are changes lawmakers could make as soon as session resumes to get politics out of mapmaking..  In Illinois, politicians pick their voters – not the other way around..  Lawmakers tend to like safe districts. Illinois and 35 other states give state lawmakers the power to redraw their own state legislative districts and protect their seats against challengers from the opposite party..  This practice has deprived Illinois voters of a meaningful choice at the ballot box: In 2018, nearly half of the seats in the Illinois House and a slight majority of those in the Senate that were up for re-election faced no opponent ..  But states are trending toward taking mapmaking out of the hands of lawmakers..  Will Illinois be next? Fair maps was one of the big promises upon which Gov. J.B. Pritzker campaigned..  “We should amend the constitution to create an independent commission to draw legislative maps, and I have supported this effort for years,” he wrote as a candidate in 2018. According to the nonprofit CHANGE Illinois, Pritzker donated $50,000 to a fair maps initiative in 2014..  So when will the governor deliver on this promise?.  Politicians draw the legislative map every 10 years. Here’s how it works:.  Both the House and Senate must approve a map, which the governor may then veto or sign into law. If state lawmakers can’t get a map to the finish line, party leadership appoints an eight-member committee to hash things out. If the committee can’t agree on a map, the secretary of state appoints a tiebreaking ninth partisan by random chance. Whichever party wins the lottery for the ninth seat then draws the map..  Pritzker and state lawmakers should support a constitutional amendment to ensure independent mapmaking. One such proposal has already gained bipartisan support in the Illinois Senate..  But even without a constitutional amendment, there are statutory changes lawmakers could make as soon as session resumes to get politics out of mapmaking following the 2020 Census..  One step Springfield could take would be to form an independent redistricting commission tasked with drafting a legislative map for the General Assembly’s approval. An ideal commission would exclude lawmakers themselves, as well as their family members, staff and Springfield political lobbyists..  Further, commissioners should be encouraged to consider boundaries of local governments and communities sharing social or economic interests and redraw districts with public input; and ignore the consequences of those revisions for incumbent officeholders or the influence of their own political party..  Before Illinois lawmakers can recover voters’ record-low trust in their political leadership, they must first recover voters’ trust in the legitimacy of the districts they’re elected to represent.

406,"""OMG, our beloved Emperor is gone! (sorta') But don't worry: the Democrats are fanning the flames of crazy, so it's just a matter of time before they run things again."" Tuesday, December 3 Ultra-liberal Evanston, Illinois, legalizes pot sales by promising tax revenue will go to ""reparations"" Evanston, Illinois, is a wealthy suburb of Chicago and home to Northwestern University. Recently the town's city council voted to allow legal cannabis dispensaries to open within the city limits. But instead of collecting taxes on the sale of weed, Evanston's virtue-signalling council members have said they'll use the expected tax revenue from legalized pot to establish a fund that will pay what amount to reparations to the city’s black residents. The city council says they hope the measure will halt gentrification and keep the city “diverse,” though council members claim they merely want to rectify the lingering institutional effects of slavery and discrimination. The city, which has a reputation as a haven for so-called “limousine liberals,” isn’t new to the idea of reparations, though, just this particular program. Last year the city council created an ""Equity and Empowerment Commission"" to investigate the possibility of starting a reparations program after the city’s black population dropped, partly due to ongoing gentrification. The commission came up with the plan to issue reparations before they came up with a source of funding. That problem was neatly solved when Illinois legalized recreational marijuana last summer. Instead of paying cash directly, the city will instead “provide reparations in the form of assistance” by establish a fund that will support community programs designed to help minorities. But yet another committee is looking at building ""free"" housing or providing ""economic incentives."" The city says the fund will be capped at $10 million, and projects that the marijuana tax could generate $500,000 to $750,000 per year.” A handful of skeptics claim the Constitution doesn't allow tax revenue to be used to benefit members of just one race, but those pushing the idea smile, noting that as long as the enabling ordinance doesn't explicitly limit the program, there's no problem. Other skeptics claim the council cunningly pushed the ""reparations"" angle to make pot sales inside city limits more attractive to voters. Hmmm.... So herewith, a modest prediction: Wannabee pot millionaires will instantly team with race hustlers across the U.S. to push ""reparations-from-pot-sales-taxes"" schemes in every reluctant city. They'll make the deal even sweeter by proposing that cities set aside a third of all pot licenses exclusively for minorities.

409,"Grace Hauck USA TODAY CHICAGO — Midwestern cities are leading the nation in providing opportunities to immigrant communities, and Chicago's setting the standard, according to a report released Wednesday. New American Economy, a bipartisan research group dedicated to comprehensive immigration reform , released its second-annual Cities Index , which assesses how well the 100 largest cities are supporting immigrants. This year, Chicago ranked number one , followed by Chula Vista, Cali.; Jersey City; and San Francisco. “We are tremendously proud Chicago has been named the most welcoming city in America for immigrants and refugees,” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement. “This ranking reflects the passionate and dedicated work of countless public officials and community members across our city who have come together to stand up and fight for the rights of our immigrant and refugee communities, no matter the cost.” Michael Bloomberg, Rupert Murdoch and other corporate executives launched New American Economy in 2010 as a coalition dedicated to reframing immigration reform as the solution to repairing and stimulating the American economy. The group aims to secure the borders and prevent illegal immigration, create more opportunities for immigrants to join the U.S. workforce and build a path to legal status for all undocumented immigrants. The group's annual index uses 51 factors to determine how well cities are creating environments that help immigrants succeed, including a city's language access policies, employment and homeownership rates and more. Andrew Lim, Director of Quantative Research at New American Economy, said that Chicago came out on top this year because the city has created an inclusive legal environment and has taken up policies supporting undocumented immigrants and DACA recipients. Like other major cities, however, Chicago came up short on providing access to affordable housing and income equality. Immigrants make up more than one-fifth of Chicago's population , according to city estimates. In 2016, immigrants held nearly a quarter of the spending power among the city’s residents, earned nearly $17 billion in household income, and paid $6 billion in taxes in 2016. That year, nearly 20,000 DACA-eligible individuals were living in Chicago. The Windy City has long considered itself a safe haven of immigrant communities. In 2016, then-mayor Rahm Emanuel declared Chicago a sanctuary city, later challenging the Trump administration's attempt to deny sanctuary cities federal funding. In recent years, the city has implemented a new legal protection fund and launched a task force to coordinate policies affecting immigrants and refugees. ""We're glad to see that Chicago is ahead of the curve, which is due in large part to the immigrant community members who have fought hard to make the city more welcoming. Now, with a new mayor, we have a new opportunity to further solidify the progress that cities are making for immigrant communities across the country,"" said Lawrence Benito, Executive Director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. Chicago isn't the only Midwestern city making big strides in developing policies that support immigrants. Cleveland, Milwaukee and Toledo were among the cities whose scores improved the most from last year. ""Midwestern cities are really proactive on this issue,"" Lim said. ""A lot of that has to do with their own economic development plans. A lot of cities in the Midwest have struggled with population loss, so they’re really encouraging people to stay in these cities or to come from afar to help them bounce back."" Medium-to-large-size cities in the South and near the border — such as Chula Vista, located in the San Diego metro area — are also seeing policy improvements as immigrants and non-immigrants alike flock to cheaper housing and job opportunities, Lim said. In smaller cities such as Jacksonville, Fla., Norfolk, Va., and St. Petersburg, Fla., the researchers reported smaller gaps in homeownership rates, health insurance rates and educational attainment rates between immigrants and people born in the U.S. Researchers said many of the top cities had implemented policies aimed at welcoming immigrants. Dozens have an office for immigrant affairs, and more than half run or support entrepreneurship programs that cater to immigrants. Others have issued municipal identification cards to increase immigrants' access to social services, established legal defense funds for immigrants facing deportation, and provided services that guide immigrants through the naturalization process. Lim said the idea of an index first arose out of a desire to create a ""universal yardstick"" that cities could use to understand how their policies compared to those of other cities. ""Often times, the question would come up — how do we compare to other cities? What are our peer cities doing?"" Lim said. ""We created this index to help local actors and policymakers have an idea of where they stand.""

411,"Seven weeks of COVID-19 restrictions have caused Illinois to lose $636 million in state and local revenues from the hospitality industry, according to an analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)..  The steep drop in tourism and travel spending led to a loss of guest spending in the state amounting to $1.9 billion. Losses to the jurisdiction’s gross domestic product amounted to $2.3 billion, while business sales took a hit of $4.3 billion..  About 44 percent of hotel workers in each state are expected to lose their jobs due to plummeting tourism during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the American Hotel & Lodging Association. The total number of hospitality jobs in Illinois make up 4.6 percent of the workforce, the BLS numbers show..

(SPRINGFIELD) Health officials throughout Illinois and across the United States are encouraging residents to get their flu shots early this year, especially now, as the battle against COVID-19 continues. While both the flu and coronavirus can cause serious respiratory illness and co-infection could possibly lead to more severe illnesses, hospitalization, and even death, folks are encouraged to at least get the flu shot to help eliminate at least one of the issues. The Centers for Disease Control and Illinois Department of Public Health both recommend either the influenza vaccine or nasal spray for everyone six months of age and older. For more information about the symptoms for the flu and COVID-19, go to the www.dph.illinois.gov website or check out the national website for more details, at www.cdc.gov..  (CHICAGO) Attorney General Kwame Raoul led a bipartisan coalition of 31 states in filing an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to support states’ authority to enforce price gouging regulations to protect consumers during emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The coalition is urging the appellate court to overturn the district court’s decision in a lawsuit filed by the Online Merchants Guild in the state of Kentucky. The court entered a preliminary injunction preventing Kentucky from enforcing price gouging regulations against retailers selling products on Amazon. In the brief, the coalition says that national and local emergencies, such as the pandemic, create significant shortages for essential items. State price gouging laws are essential to ensuring that goods can be fairly allocated among residents, and to preventing bad actors from profiting off of residents by charging excessively high prices for goods that are scarce. Among the other Midwestern and regional states joining Illinois in the coalition fight are Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Wisconsin..

414,"POLL: Which of these institutions, if any, do you trust?.  The horse, which is in critical condition due to its injuries, may now need to be euthanized..  Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) tapped Hollingsworth to work with her earlier this year to boost census participation in the city. What are the details?.  According to a report from WTTW-TV , Hollingsworth rode the horse for more than seven miles on the Dan Ryan Expressway during Monday's impromptu protest..  The horse, which was reportedly not outfitted with proper shoes for concrete, collapsed after running for about an hour..  Cook County prosecutors said the horse's treatment was the ""equivalent of forcing an 80-year-old woman run a marathon,"" WTTW reported..  Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Kevin Deboni said that the horse was nearly run to death and suffered ""extensive damage"" to its health..  Deboni said that the horse's eyes ""were dilated to the point they looked like cartoon eyes."" All for #KidsLivesMatter.  Hollingsworth said that he rode the horse on the Dan Ryan Expressway during rush hour to support the #KidsLivesMatter movement, according to the outlet, which describes the initiative as one ""that aims to raise awareness and motivate residents to fill out the census to help communities receive better funding."".  According to Block Club Chicago , the movement is in response to children killed by gun violence..  In August, Hollingsworth told the Block Club, ""When you get kids occupied and they've got things to do with their time and their life … all this senseless killing that's going on, it'll slow down a whole lot. It's important to support dance groups [or] anything that's got something to do with kids. If it's something positive, support it."".  Witnesses of the Dan Ryan Expressway incident told the outlet that they saw Hollingsworth kicking and whipping the horse to keep it running even after it slowed its pace due to exhaustion and injury. Shortly after, the horse collapsed on the ground..  Emergency veterinarians responded to the scene and took the horse in for treatment of severe dehydration, overheating, and lacerations to its front legs that caused heavy bleeding. Authorities took Hollingsworth into custody..  WFLD-TV reported that the horse also had sores beneath its saddle, which was not properly padded. A felony charge and a rebuke from the mayor.  In a statement, Mayor Lightfoot's office condemned Hollingsworth's ""stunt."".  ""There is a right way and a wrong way to call attention to issues of great importance and this stunt was decidedly the very wrong way,"" the mayor's office said in its statement..  Hollingsworth was charged with a felony count of aggravated cruelty to an animal, as well as misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct, trespassing, and other traffic-related offenses..  At the time of this reporting, the horse remains in critical condition, and will never be able to be ridden again..  The horse may also have to be euthanized due to its injuries and ""due to the suffering the animal will likely endure for the rest of its life."".  Hollingsworth was held on $25,000 bond during a Wednesday court appearance, and was required to pay 10%. He is due back in court on Sept. 30. 'Lori, come help me, I can't do it alone'.  On Thursday, a tearful Hollingsworth told the Chicago Sun-Times that he did not abuse the horse..  ""My focus is on the 'Kids Lives Matter' because if you look up the history of when it comes down to kids getting killed, 2020 is the highest rate ... and it ain't right,"" he told reporters. ""Everybody is trying to steer away from that part, and that is very important — that is an important topic we need to stick on."".  Hollingsworth insisted that how he treated the horse was ""no different than how horses are treated in the circus or at a racetrack,"" the outlet reported..  ""The people that don't know anything about horses looking from the outside in, you would think that what I did was cruelty to animals,"" he explained. ""But if you go to a racetrack, it's 100 times worse, if you go to a circus, worse. ... It's way worse than what I do to my horses. I probably could've did a little bit less, but I had to make a statement."".  He also insisted that the description of the horse's injuries were exaggerated, and that he would like to appoint an independent veterinarian to examine the horse..  ""I think that is just a way to make the situation seem worse than it is because I am a black brother and I am doing very good for the community and standing up for the Kids Lives Matter movement and not focused on anything else,"" Hollingsworth reasoned..  He also revealed that he has been the subject of abuse since his arrest..  ""Every day I step outside I am taking a chance with my life,"" he said. ""I basically look at [the hate mail] and just close them. I can't change how a person feels."".  He also called upon Lightfoot to defend him..  ""When [Mayor Lightfoot] called upon me [to assist with the 2020 census], I was there for her,"" he added. ""Monday was my stress signal: Lori, come help me, I can't do it alone.""

415,"CARTERVILLE (WSIL) -- A federal judge in California ruled in favor of extending the 2020 Census counting deadline late Thursday, and if upheld, would give the count until October 31..  Speaking before an audience at an un-related press conference in Englewood Friday morning, Gov. JB Pritzker took a moment to note that ruling..  ""Before we begin, I want to acknowledge some news that came out this morning. We've learned that the courts have ruled against the Trump administration's unjust attempts to end the census early,"" said Pritzker, who was just in southern Illinois Thursday, urging residents to complete the census as the deadline was less than a week away..  ""Here in Illinois, we are working diligently to ensure an accurate and complete count and we will do so until the very end, and that means until the end of October."".  But hours after Pritzker made that statement, the Trump administration filed an appeal to block the ruling..  Southern Seven Health Department Community Outreach Coordinator Shawnna Rhine says the ruling and the appeal may lead to confusion of when the actual deadline is..  ""Now until we hear otherwise, we are looking at September 30 as our end date,"" explains Rhine..  The original end date was July 31. It got pushed back to October 31 in April, when COVID-19 hit. Then in July, the end date was changed to September 31..  Southern Seven was in Golconda Friday, holding what they believed to be their last 2020 census sign-up event..  ""What the extension can do is to give us a little more time in order to educate some of these hard-to-reach populations,"" said Rhine, adding that more time would allow for a more accurate count..  ""If it is extended, if we learn that earlier in the week, we will be holding other events to try and get people out there,"" she said, adding that those regions in Illinois with the lowest response rates are among some of the communities most in need..  At the press conference, Gov. Pritzker expressed urgency in filling out the census saying the people of Illinois pay more than they get in return..  ""We're one of the ten 'giver states,' where we get less money back from the federal government than we pay in federal taxes,"" he explained. ""Well, we should get our fair share from the federal government: getting the census right is one important way to do that.""","[0.7406567335128784, 0.2593432068824768]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.7406567335128784
416,"NuNu, the American Paint horse ridden more than seven miles down the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago last week, is expected to recover from the injuries she sustained, though she should never be ridden again..  NuNu was seen in a viral video posted by Adam Hollingsworth, known as The Dread Head Cowboy, early last week as part of a protest against the number of children getting shot in Chicago. Hollingsworth’s intended purpose quickly shifted when it was reported that NuNu was forced to run on the paved highway without shoes and was whipped to continue when she collapsed..  By the time Hollingsworth stopped, NuNu hooves were bleeding, her teeth were damaged, and she had saddle sores. Michael Sneed of the Chicago Sun-Times exclusively reported on Friday that NuNu “is on the mend and on her way to recovery since being moved to ahorse farm in the south suburbs.”.  Ald. Ray Lopez (15 th ) told Sneed that NuNu has “rallied,” adding he was told she “should never be ridden again.”.  More from Sneed:.  Although initially listed in critical condition and facing euthanasia following the 8-mile, shoeless ride that snarled traffic Monday, the injured horse is expected to be able to walk again in a quiet, stable environment, added Lopez..  Severely dehydrated and twice collapsing after it got to Chicago Animal Care and Control, “the horse was transferred to the Tinley Park Farm to be cared for immediately by a vet specializing in equine care,” he said..  “It’s now responding to IV fluids, and its condition has drastically improved since being transferred to the farm,” Lopez said..  Hollingsworth was charged with felony animal cruelty after his ride. Hollingsworth said he was an animal-loving person and didn’t mean to hurt the horse, but also said he would make the ride again..  “Yes, I’d do it again,” Hollingworth said, according to the Chicago Tribune . “I’ve been to jail. I’ve got a background. I’m not perfect. I would rather go to jail for something like (this). That is something worth going to jail for.” Hollingsworth added: “And I didn’t mean no harm on my horse, at all. I’m a horse- (and) animal-loving person. My focus is Kids Lives Matter. And If a person can’t agree with that, I don’t know what to call you.”.  Hollingsworth called on Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to help him as well as the famous rappers who live in Chicago. Hollingsworth was previously called on by Lightfoot to act as a “census cowboy” and promote census compliance..  “A fan of Batman, Lightfoot said she was sounding a ‘distress signal’ like the one used to summon the caped crusader by Gotham Police officials to call on the social media star, the Dreadhead Cowboy,” WTTW Chicago reported at the time..  After his arrest for animal cruelty, Hollingsworth begged Lightfoot to step in..  “When she called upon me, I was there for her,” Hollingworth said, according to the Tribune. “What I did Monday was my stress signal. Lori come help me. I can’t do it alone.”.  The Sun-Times also reported that before his highway stunt and his appointment by Lightfoot, Hollingsworth was already on authorities’ radar for riding a horse near the expressway..  “This is not the first time,” Ald. Lopez said. “We had videos and pictures of him multiple times before the mayor hired him to be her census outreach person/cowboy..  “We were trying to find out where he lived before the mayor hired him,” Lopez added. “We were actually on the hunt for him due to concern about how his horse was being kept.”.   more in:","[0.5010896921157837, 0.49891024827957153]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5010896921157837
417,"Community members participate in a budget game outlining their priorities Saturday, Sept. 26, 2020 in Austin’s Moore Park. (Grace Del Vecchio / WTTW News).  Saturday afternoon at Moore Park in Austin, community members gathered to distribute food, complete the 2020 census and learn about the City of Chicago’s budget..   Each year, city officials define a budget for Chicago. While the city budget process includes public hearings, Saturday’s event sought to get community input on their budget priorities..  The event, sponsored by the Black Men Project in collaboration with local churches (which provided food and census information), featured a presentation of the People’s Budget Chicago by Chicago United for Equity (CUE)..  Through collaborations with community-based organizations, CUE asks residents how they think city money should be spent, focusing on city neighborhoods that have faced the most financial disinvestment to develop a budget..  “People’s Budget Chicago is a budget built for us, by us,” said CUE Executive Director Niketa Brar..  The People’s Budget asks one primary question: What do our communities need to be safe and thriving?.  Community members answer that question directly by writing it on a dry erase board and by participating in a group discussion process dubbed, “The Budget Game.”.  How the game works. Five community members decide how a $100 budget will be spent, with each participant spending $20 how they see fit on six budget priorities: health, education, housing, infrastructure, community resources and carceral systems (police)..  Here’s how the Austin community budget broke down once all of the participants placed their tokens on a colorful board with the six budget priorities, $17 for health, $22 for education, $17 on housing, $14 on infrastructure, $15 on community resources and $15 on carceral systems..  The Austin residents’ allocations presented a stark contrast with that of the current city budget. Presented as a simplified budget, the city spends $4 on health, $10 on education, $4 on housing, $23 on infrastructure, $24 on community resources and $36 on carceral systems..  The game is a learning tool. “They’re actually learning how the city’s budget (is) divided into those six categories and how far apart was how much you invested from what your alderman invested in,” Brar said..  (Grace Del Vecchio / WTTW News).  (Grace Del Vecchio / WTTW News).  (Grace Del Vecchio / WTTW News).  (Grace Del Vecchio / WTTW News).  (Grace Del Vecchio / WTTW News).  (Grace Del Vecchio / WTTW News).  (Grace Del Vecchio / WTTW News).  (Grace Del Vecchio / WTTW News).  (Grace Del Vecchio / WTTW News).  Community members were shocked by the differences in their priorities and those of elected officials..  One community member, Taihitia Shelby, said she was appalled to see exactly where her money was going. She also questioned whether the funding was actually going where it was supposed to..  “Even though on a piece of paper you’re seeing that it’s going there but in actuality, in my mind, it makes me think, ‘Is it actually going there?’” said Shelby..  While there were multiple differences between the two budgets, the most glaring was the amount of money spent on carceral systems, which in the city budget was more than double what Austin residents allocated..  Shelby said she supports reallocating carceral funds to other budget priorities..  “I think if you provided more things that others need, you probably wouldn’t have to provide so much in the police system,” said Shelby. “Because now people can afford housing. … They have somewhere to stay now. With health, the same way, they’re able to take care of themselves, some people that are just out hanging that police pick up, it’s because they have nowhere to go.”.  She says funding other budget priorities will likely spark “a change in your community.”.  “This is our money,” said Brar who helped community members figure out who their alderman was if they didn’t already know..  Community members then wrote their aldermen postcards, which were to be hand delivered to their offices..  “It’s being able to get the community more involved so we can have a say in where we should put our money to and if it doesn’t happen that way, we just gotta keep putting our foot down until we get exactly what we want,” said Shelby. “People have to fight sometimes.”.  The Austin event was part of the People’s Budget Bus Tour , which has stopped in Englewood, Bronzeville and Humboldt Park, and will be making stops in Roseland, South Lawndale and Little Village, Uptown, Englewood, Uptown and Altgeldt Gardens in the coming days..

419,"The feds had no comment for us about a court order that suddenly ended the Census last week. But Chicago leaders did..  CBS 2’s Lauren Victory on Saturday shared insight from city population counters who thought they would have until the end of the month to wrap up..  When CBS 2 sat down with U.S. Census Bureau Chicago Regional Director Marilyn Sanders in January, she didn’t know, we didn’t know, and you didn’t know that a global virus was going to mess up a lot of things..  That included the tall task of getting population numbers and demographics of everyone who lives in the Midwest..  Sanders and a whole lot of other people had been preparing for the 2020 Census for the past 10 years. But the coronavirus pandemic caused cheery videos of census takers to be edited to show people wearing masks..  And plans to count people needed changing too..  “Shortening the timeline, lengthening the timeline,” said Nubia Willman, director of the Chicago Office of New Americans..  Willman said the scramble took a toll..  “All of that back-and-forth just caused a lot of confusion and mistrust essentially,” she said..  Then last week came one of the biggest blows to city counting efforts. A court order abruptly ended the Census 16 days earlier than expected..  “It affected us in the sense that there were still pockets of historically undercounted communities that we just weren’t able to reach,” Willman said..  Missing just one person costs an estimated $1,400 in federal funding a year. Multiply that by 10, because the Census is once a decade, and that is $14,000 per person until 2030..  “To not have that extra time really cut us off at the knees,” Willman said..  But Willman said the city did its best given the time crunch and the pandemic..  “It became a wifi hotspot,” she said..  The city rolled with the punches in a mobile census van, and more..  “We were doing, we are doing, we did, and we did do better than most major cities,” Willman said..  Chicago’s final count will be determined in the coming weeks..  Current data show Chicago ranks sixth best for residents filling out the Census themselves. That is among cities with more than 1 million residents..  Willman said difficulty with the 2020 Census began before COVID-19 hit. She feels the controversy over the question of citizenship – which ultimately did not make it on the questionnaire – caused fear in immigrant communities..

SPRINGFIELD – Regardless of your feelings on the “stay home” order, an Illinois business group says the order and higher taxes make a bad combination. “It’s heartbreaking to watch what’s been happening to businesses and workers, and it’s terrible what our state is going through; yet, our governor still thinks it’s a good idea to raise taxes on businesses at a time when small businesses are being decimated by these closures.

A proposed constitutional amendment asks voters if they want to change the requirement that Illinois’ income tax be a flat tax. Gov.

BELLEVILLE — The U.S. Census Bureau will extend the deadline for when people can respond to the census by three months. The revised schedule was pushed back last month because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to an updated schedule provided by the bureau..  Nearly every aspect of how the census counts people living in the U.S. is impacted by this extension. The self-response window and in-person follow ups for households that do not respond will now wrap up at the end of October instead of July..  The extension presents both challenges and opportunities for Illinois, which has relied on local community organizations across the state to promote census engagement with state funded grants , through local in-person outreach, physical and social media advertising and events..  The Illinois Department of Human Services granted nearly $30 million to 31 organizations across the state last November . Illinois Gov. Pritzker has said he will pass a full budget for the next fiscal year , but lawmakers have not returned to Springfield yet..  “That [funding] is just through this fiscal year, and then we hope to have an additional appropriation for our budget for census for fiscal year 2021, which would start in July,” said Marishonta Wilkerson, a 2020 census office director for Illinois, whose office is in IDHS..  There’s about $8 million left of the original $30 million grant that’s partially going toward veterans, migrant workers and seniors, Wilkerson said, adding the money must be used by the end of June..  Budgeting aside, the bureau’s extension of the count is a net positive because it allows communities in Illinois more time to respond, Wilkerson said..  “If we have more time, we have more time to get it right,” she said. Loading....  The county governments and community groups promoting census participation at a local level can continue doing so, even if they don’t get more funding from the state. It just becomes more difficult..  “We can still continue to encourage people to complete the questionnaire, but that would have to be done with funds outside of IDHS or private donations,” said Shannon Anderson, program manager at Teens Against Killing Everywhere (TAKE). The organization is based in East St. Louis and received grant money from the state..  Anderson expects census outreach in the Metro East will continue whether or not her organization receives another grant..  “The beautiful thing about this is we’re working with a lot of community partners and residents,” Anderson said. “Even without funding, I’m sure that the people we’ve been working with will continue.”.  Her organization paid for online and physical advertising, like billboards, to get the word out about census participation. Anderson said the billboards will remain up until someone else buys the space, which could be after June 30..  Right now, TAKE is focused on using online methods to reach youth who are living below the poverty line, Anderson said..  “We have been meeting them on social media, and it has been working providing questionnaire assistance either through Facebook Live, Facebook Messenger or Instagram Live,” she said..  Anderson added seniors have been harder to engage right now. TAKE has less access to them right now because of the coronavirus, she said..  Illinois has one of the best response rates among the 50 states so far in the 2020 census. Nearly 60% of households in the state have responded to the headcount already.

424,"Source: The Washington Post.  A Democrat-run Illinois city has announced plans to introduce a new sales tax and use the revenue to pay slavery reparations to black residents of the city..  The fund will simply require African-Americans to prove residency and will not require beneficiaries of the fund to prove slave ancestry. The fund currently has a 10-year cap of $10 million..  According The Washington Post , city lawmakers in Evanston, just north of Chicago, voted 8-to-1 on Nov. 25 to tax marijuana sales at a rate of 3 percent and use the revenue to develop the reparations fund..  WesternJournal report : With two potential retailers seeking licenses in the city and one local medical dispensary preparing to open its doors for recreational sales come January — when recreational sale of the drug officially becomes legal in the state — estimates suggest the tax will raise between $500,000 and $750,000 for the fund on a yearly basis..  Private donations are also expected to bolster the fund..  There are just a few major problems with this plan — not least among them the fact that there is, in fact, no plan whatsoever..  At the time of the Nov. 25 vote, there was no defined road map for how the money from this fund would be distributed. Not until Dec. 11 will local officials meet to finalize details..  At this point, the public has been left with city Alderman Robin Rue Simmons’ vague description of potential uses for the fund — that it could aid black families with housing down payments they may not otherwise be able to afford or grant educational and technical training stipends to young, black professionals..  And this apparently minuscule detail pales in comparison to the fact that the fund will not require beneficiaries to prove slave ancestry..  Potential recipients must simply prove residency and, well, be African-American..  “Our community was damaged due to the war on drugs and marijuana convictions. This is a chance to correct that,” Simmons told The Post. “Our disadvantage and discrimination has continued beyond outlawing Jim Crow and beyond enslavement.”.  Now, it was not long ago — just this past summer, in fact, when the newly Democrat-led House of Representatives held a hearing on reparations legislation — that reparations were billed simply as a financial leg up for those Americans potentially impeded in the current day by an ancestor’s history as a slave..  Do I agree with such legislation? No..  But at the very least, I can find a consistent logical through-line. The argument could be made that an American family who find its roots in first-generation enslavement is certainly not at a level starting point..  This rapid expansion on the concept of reparations, however, which Simmons herself admitted to be “radical,” begs a number of questions..  Does the modern American left truly believe that simply being non-white in America leaves one so disadvantaged that only a financial boost from the government can place a person of black descent on equal footing?.  How do we quantify such a disadvantage?.  Will all of that disadvantage magically disappear with the signing of a government-sponsored check?.  Surely a few thousand dollars could not make up for odds that are so severely unequal..  And that is all this check would be — throwing a few thousand dollars at the problem, at most..  In Evanston, for example, with a black population of around 12,500 — according to 2018 U.S. Census Bureau data — a $10 million dollar reparations fund would pay out around $800 to each beneficiary if the money was doled out evenly..  That’s significantly less than a month’s paycheck for most Americans..  So is $800 supposed to make up for the apparently insurmountable disadvantages faced by non-white Americans?.  No. It obviously is not..  But you’d be a fool to believe this has anything to do with actual social justice and concepts of equity or equality..  This has everything to do with the American left adding a few new moves to its pandering routine as they watch the Trump economy convince thousands of non-white Americans to walk away from failed left-wing policy.

428,"loudlytransparenttrash :.  You don’t read about the shootings in cities like Chicago for the same reason you don’t read about all the car accidents - they happen all the time. But it’s also because the shooting death toll is embarrassing to the Democrat establishment that has been running these cities for the past fifty-plus years. Last year, 561 people were shot and killed in Chicago and 2948 others were wounded. That’s just one city. In the entire United States in 2018, there were 81 deaths in mass shootings. Every single day at least one person is shot and killed in Chicago. On weekends, it’s normal for there to be a dozen shootings and multiple deaths, including children . On the first weekend of June, 52 people were shot and 10 killed . The first weekend of July, 66 people shot, 6 killed . On the first weekend of August, 52 were shot and 7 killed. The worst part, only 17 percent of these homicides are ever solved because everybody refuses to speak to the police. Here you can track the daily shooting victims and homicides . It actually makes for more interesting news when the city goes a whole 24 hours without a shooting..  Yet Democrats and the mainstream media stay quiet. They only speak when a shooter is white. Black children, women and young men being gunned down by black shooters every day - there’s nothing to see here. They ignore the unparalleled levels of violence in these streets because the gun control measures they advocate for on a national level have horribly failed in their own backyards. Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Gun violence in Chicago could use more attention and fresh ideas, or possibly tried and proven ideas such as stop, question and search, yet anyone who even dares to highlight the issue is called racist. Last month, Trump visited Chicago to speak at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference. He called out the Chicago leadership for allowing the violence to become one of the worst in the world. The city’s superintendent, Eddie Johnson, skipped his own event in protest of Trump, calling him a racist. Chicago’s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, along with the entire mainstream media, called Trump “ignorant” and blasted him for “insulting” the city..  Instead of reacting to the masses of young people being shot and killed every day, the media has programmed us to react to Trump. We’re supposed to believe Trump and “white supremacy” is the biggest threat to us and just ignore that black children are being shot while eating lunch on their porch, trick-or-treating or going home after homecoming. Trump says Chicago’s shooting crisis needs help and intervention, Chicago leaders tell Trump he’s a racist. We have a president who’s willing to work with Chicago to fully fund programs aimed at positive alternatives for at-risk individuals, using interventions shown to have long-term impacts on violent behavior. But “Trump’s not welcome in Chicago.” Chicago instead cheered when they became a sanctuary city. Their leaders vowed to protect and shelter illegal migrants, while their own citizens are killed every day. They also cheered when higher taxes were placed on “amusement” and everything else, yet their middle class has evaporated and poverty grows..  It’s true Chicago’s crime doesn’t define the city or its people. Its level-headed citizens are no less concerned by the mass shootings and crime that plague the West and South sides. Chicago’s Democratic control has transformed the city into a two-tier class society, chasing out the middle class and abandoning the poor. In 2018, Chicago’s population dropped for the fourth year in a row. Failing schools, poverty, crime, restricted policing. But after 50 years of voting for the same city government, there has to be some shared responsibility. The people should have a legitimate grievance against their city government but they don’t have a legitimate solution. That’s going to require breaking the Democratic party’s monopoly on the city’s politics, and something much more difficult, breaking the monopoly on black Chicagoan’s ideology. The silence during mass shootings in Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore etc every day proves they don’t care about black lives or mass shootings, they only care about politics and gaining enough power and support to remove the Second Amendment.","[0.517891526222229, 0.482108473777771]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.517891526222229
429,"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration could shorten the U.S. Census count on Tuesday, just hours after the Illinois government committed an additional $1 million to outreach..  The Trump administration originally tried to shorten the end date of the census to Sept. 30, but federal courts mandated the administration keep the count going until Oct. 31, the extended deadline originally set by the federal government in response to the coronavirus pandemic..  However, following the 7-1 SCOTUS ruling, the U.S. Census Bureau announced it was ending the count at 5 a.m. Friday, Oct. 16 in Illinois..  The Census Bureau will continue to accept self-responses from Illinoisans online at the U.S. Census website through that 5 a.m. deadline and will accept phone responses and paper forms postmarked by Oct. 15..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker tweeted about the ruling shortly after its announcement, calling the decision ""wrong"" and saying it could lead to ""an undercount in communities that can least afford it, perpetuating generations of disinvestment that make our nation weaker."".  Enumeration, or the total rate of households being counted in the census, is currently at 99.9 percent for the U.S. and Illinois, according to the Census Bureau. However, census outreach advocates say that the self-response is a more reliable measure for an accurate count..  ""It's not an exact science,"" said Anita Banerji, director of the Democracy Initiative at Forefront, which conducts census outreach in Illinois..  According to Banerji, multiple factors and situations can affect enumeration tallies conducted by census agents. People living in nursing homes, college campuses and prisons can skew totals. The coronavirus pandemic has displaced families and killed thousands in Illinois over the course of the census count..  ""Getting to that 99 percent when you think about all the different challenges we've had, it's not an exact number,"" Banerji said. ""So for all intents and purposes, we as advocates focus on the self-response number because we know that to be more of a tried and true number."".  Illinois' self-response rate sits at 71.2 percent as of Tuesday, the seventh highest in the nation, and the state is the most populous in the top 10 for self-response. In 2010, the state's self-response rate was 70.5 percent..  In a release distributed Tuesday before the SCOTUS ruling, the Pritzker administration announced it had spent an additional $1 million through the Illinois Department of Human Services for ""census-related media outreach in communities of color across the state"" to encourage more households to fill out self-response forms for the census..  According to that release, ""many underserved and marginalized neighborhoods and cities are hovering between a 40-50 percent participation rate,"" which puts hundreds of millions of federal dollars at stake over the next 10 years..  Funds that could go toward programs to assist those traditionally underserved and marginalized communities in Illinois that aren't getting counted..  While the $1 million expenditure was meant to propel outreach for the last two weeks, IDHS officials said operations to conduct outreach over the next two days are underway and that all money has already been spent..  By law, the Census Bureau must report the results of the census to the president by Dec. 31. According to Banerji, that's a process that normally takes five to six months to make sure the data is accurate..  With less than three months from the end of the count to when the bureau must submit that first report, Banerji said compiling data from self-response is much easier for the bureau to confirm its accuracy than data collected by census agents in non-response follow-ups..  Advocates, lawmakers and government officials across the state and the country have been imploring residents to fill out self-response forms as soon as possible before the impending deadline..  ""The new census count ends tomorrow,"" Pritzker said at a news conference Wednesday. ""The time to fill it out if you haven't already, is right now. The time to encourage your friends and neighbors to get counted is right now, pick up your phone and go to my2020census.gov, or call 1-844-330-2020. It takes less than 10 minutes.

SPRINGFIELD — The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration could shorten the U.S. Census count on Tuesday, just hours after the Illinois government committed an additional $1 million to outreach..  The Trump administration originally tried to shorten the end date of the census to Sept. 30, but federal courts mandated the administration keep the count going until Oct. 31, the extended deadline originally set by the federal government in response to the coronavirus pandemic. However, following the 7-1 SCOTUS ruling, the U.S. Census Bureau announced it was ending the count at 5 a.m. Friday in Illinois..  The Census Bureau will continue to accept self-responses from Illinoisans online at My2020Census.gov through that 5 a.m. deadline and will accept phone responses and paper forms postmarked by Oct. 15..  Gov. JB Pritzker tweeted about the ruling shortly after its announcement, calling the decision “wrong” and saying it could lead to “an undercount in communities that can least afford it, perpetuating generations of disinvestment that make our nation weaker.”.  Enumeration, or the total rate of households being counted in the census, is currently at 99.9 percent for the U.S. and Illinois, according to the Census Bureau. However, census outreach advocates say that the self-response is a more reliable measure for an accurate count..  “It’s not an exact science,” said Anita Banerji, director of the Democracy Initiative at Forefront, which conducts census outreach in Illinois..  According to Banerji, multiple factors and situations can affect enumeration tallies conducted by census agents. People living in nursing homes, college campuses and prisons can skew totals. The coronavirus pandemic has displaced families and killed thousands in Illinois over the course of the census count..  “Getting to that 99 percent when you think about all the different challenges we’ve had, it’s not an exact number,” Banerji said. “So for all intents and purposes, we as advocates focus on the self-response number because we know that to be more of a tried and true number.”.  Illinois’ self-response rate sits at 71.2 percent as of Tuesday, the 7th highest in the nation, and the state is the most populous in the top 10 for self-response. In 2010, the state’s self-response rate was 70.5 percent..  In a release distributed Tuesday before the SCOTUS ruling, the Pritzker administration announced it had spent an additional $1 million through the Illinois Department of Human Services for “census-related media outreach in communities of color across the state” to encourage more households to fill out self-response forms for the census..  According to that release, “many underserved and marginalized neighborhoods and cities are hovering between a 40-50 percent participation rate,” which puts hundreds of millions of federal dollars at stake over the next 10 years. Funds that could go toward programs to assist those traditionally underserved and marginalized communities in Illinois that aren’t getting counted..  While the $1 million expenditure was meant to propel outreach for the last two weeks, IDHS officials said operations to conduct outreach over the next two days are underway and that all money has already been spent..  By law, the Census Bureau must report the results of the census to the president by Dec. 31. According to Banerji, that’s a process that normally takes 5 to 6 months to make sure the data is accurate. With less than 3 months from the end of the count to when the bureau must submit that first report, Banerji said compiling data from self-response is much easier for the bureau to confirm its accuracy than data collected by census agents in non-response follow-ups..  Advocates, lawmakers and government officials across the state and the country have been imploring residents to fill out self-response forms as soon as possible before the impending deadline..  “The new census count ends tomorrow,” Pritzker said at a news conference Wednesday. “The time to fill it out if you haven't already, is right now. The time to encourage your friends and neighbors to get counted is right now, pick up your phone and go to my2020census.gov , or call 1-844-330-2020. It takes less than 10 minutes.

MOLINE, IL – A collaborative research paper about Quad Cities bicycle trails by one Western Illinois University graduate student and one alumna, along with their professor, has been projected to “make a major contribution to the field,” with its findings related to diversity among those who use the trails..  Recreation, Park and Tourism Administration (RPTA) graduate student Sadie Parker, of Redlands, CA, and RPTA alumna Haily Hinson, of Hohenwald, TN, are in the process of making edits to their paper, “Spatial Accessibility of Bicycle Routes in the Quad Cities: Impacts for Environmental Justice.” The two authors wrote the paper as part of their graduate studies with RPTA Professor Rob Porter and hope to have it published in an academic journal..  The students’ research used Geographic Information System (GIS) data to more closely examine the placement and use of the bicycle trails in WIU RPTA Professor Rob Porter (right) and WIU senior Sadie Parker talk on a video phone call to WIU alumna Haily Hinson next to the bicycle trails in front of WIU’s Quad Cities campus..  the Quad Cities metropolitan boundaries. The research ultimately showed a diverse population benefits from close access to the Quad Cities’ bicycle trails; a result different from what previous research in other areas of the country has suggested..  The initial idea for the project came from Porter, a frequent user of the trails..  “I have lived here nearly five years and I use the trail in front of the Quad Cities campus every day on my way to work,” said Porter. “Conceptually, I’ve looked at spaces all over the country, but this one was much closer to home.”.  The students did research on the various trails in the metro area, specifically looking at who has direct access to use the trails and who does not..  Parker and Hinson were also roommates and lived near WIU’s Quad Cities campus during the study..  “Sadie used the trail to get to school,” said Hinson. “We saw the trail every day for the last two years and decided to do a more statistical analysis.”.  The research also used sociodemographic data, available from the U.S. Census Bureau and bike trail data, provided by the Bi-State Regional Commission in the Quad Cities. Advertisement.  “We started with a literature review, reading other papers that involved environmental justice, bike trails and accessibility issues,” said Parker. “Concurrently, we reached out to bicycle trail organizations in the Quad Cities for bikeway network GIS data.”.  The study looked at both those living within 400 meters of the trail and those living further away..  “We wanted to analyze and see if there were differences in demographics and socio-economic status between the people who have close access, and those that don’t,” said Parker. “We found that those who benefitted from close access were populations of lower income, minority, college educated and short-term residents. This is not what we saw in our literature review, which was that there was often more access for the higher income, White population.”.  Porter said the research is especially vital because of its focus on diversity in trail usage..  “This is important research because I have never seen someone get this kind of comments on their work,” said Porter. “This really adds to the field of environmental justice research and the cities should be really proud of these results. Sadie and Haily did a lot to tweak the data, which allowed them to pull all of this together in a semester and do such high quality work, which included Ph.D.-level writing. There is diversity on the trails, we just never noticed it.” Advertisement.  Both women were recruited to WIU’s RPTA program by Porter. Parker said she loved the range of courses the program of study included, which tie in to what she wants to do in her future career..  Hinson said she chose WIU because of its discussion-based courses, which allowed her to learn from the opinions of others..  “This is something I really needed for my future work,” she said..  Parker is currently an intern for the United States Army Corps of Engineers Field Station in Muscatine, IA, and will graduate in December. She hopes to become a natural resource specialist who creates programs to bring diversity into the field..  Hinson is currently an apprentice for the United States Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service near the state lines of Kentucky and Tennessee; specifically at the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. She hopes to become a wildlife educator or park ranger to show future generations the importance of how to care for natural resources.","[0.5037877559661865, 0.49621230363845825]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5037877559661865

435,"Home > Uncategorized > Chicago make final 2020 census outreach efforts with new deadline on Thursday Chicago make final 2020 census outreach efforts with new deadline on Thursday newssix360 October 16, 2020 Uncategorized No Comments Eddy Borrayo’s hoodie was pulled over his head tightly Thursday morning with a bubbling sense of urgency at the front of his mind. “It’s now or never and I have a sense of there’s no tomorrow, because there really is no tomorrow,” Borrayo said. “Whatever we need to do now, we must do it to make sure everyone is counted.” The weight Borrayo felt was prompted by the U.S. Census Bureau announcing it would mostly end the 2020 census Thursday night, 15 days earlier than anticipated, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it could do so. People can still respond to the census in several ways: • Online, through 4:59 a.m. Friday at 2020census.gov . • By phone, through 1 a.m. Friday, by calling English 844-330-2020 (English), 844-468-2020 (Spanish) or 844-467-2020 (TDD). • By mail, if your form is postmarked by Thursday. Borrayo now worries Illinois will be severely undercounted because of political interference with the once-a-decade count which could spell disaster for how cities and towns are federally funded. He spent the morning at what is called the Backstretch at Hawthorne Race Course, 3501 S. Laramie Ave. in Stickney, attempting to count as many people he and his team could. Hundreds of workers who tend to the horses and the barns live in a community at the Backstretch, Borrayo said; many never were counted. “As we are talking to them, we are telling them to tell their neighbor to come out and that is how we are getting people to get counted,” Borrayo said. “This is the benefits of meeting families where they are at.” Rincon Family Services were able to help more than 100 families fill out the census ahead of the deadline. Borrayo said no census taker had previously tried to count any of these households..  President and CEO of Rincon Family Services Eddy F. Borrayo speaks about the importance of being counted in the 2020 Census during a Census event at Back of the Yards College Prep H.S. at 2111 W. 47th St. in Back of Yards, Thursday, Oct. 15, 2020. Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times The deadline to complete the census initially had been pushed back from July 31 to Oct. 31 because the bureau was forced to delay deploying census takers into communities because of the pandemic. That Oct. 31 deadline has been a point of contention in recent weeks when the Trump administration abruptly changed it to Sept. 31. The Trump administration said it needed to change the date in order to meet the Dec. 31 deadline to report census results for apportionment counts which is used to redraw state and federal legislative districts. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the Census Bureau, was hit with a lawsuit from the National Urban League demanding the last count be pushed back to Oct. 31, and a judge agreed, issuing a preliminary injunction. Ross appealed, and lost. But the U.S. Supreme Court said the bureau could end its count early. Chicago’s dismal 60.6% self-response rate is less than its 62.5% self-response rate in 2010 — and far from Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s goal of 75%. Most Black and Latino majority communities have also underperformed and hold a response rate of under 40% which is of major concern for groups like Rincon Family Services. Later in the evening, Borrayo joined U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, D-Chicago, and other elected officials in Back of the Yards for a last minute plea to fill out the census. “We are here today to remind everyone within eyeshot or earshot to please come forth and participate,” Garcia said. “Your families, your neighborhoods, your city, your states and the country needs you to be counted and this is our last chance.”.

439,"“The hard-to-count communities that we’re trying to reach respond well when the messenger is a trusted messenger,” Alvarez said. Who gets the grant money?.  The organizations that receive grant funding already have strong ties to the areas they serve and can distribute portions of their funding to other local organizations working on census outreach, Alvarez said. It’s like a hub and spoke, where an organization, like TAKE, organizes and leads other groups in the local outreach effort..  “We’re working with other organizations and delegating tasks,” Anderson said. “It’s not completely on the regional intermediaries to make it happen. It’s definitely a team effort.”.  TAKE has an idea of who they will support, but Anderson said she would not share the organizations’ names because nothing has been finalized yet..  This is the first time the state has had a dedicated census office working on these issues, Alvarez said. An accurate headcount is one thing the governor and state legislators have focused on, said Marishonta Wilkerson, co-coordinator of the Illinois Census Office..  “There’s no other state in this country that has made such an investment for the census on a per-capita basis,” she said. Hard-to-count areas.  In the metro east, TAKE is tasked with community outreach in St. Clair, Clinton, Jersey, Calhoun, Monroe and Washington counties. The majority of the region the group serves is rural. St. Clair County alone has 21 hard-to-reach census tracts..  “The top hard-to-count populations are people without cell phone plans, non-family households, households that don’t have any internet access at all, or there are a lot of rental housing,” Wilkerson said..  Anderson adds that poverty, lack of transportation and general distrust of the government are other factors that stop people from wanting to complete the census..  This is the first time grant funding of this nature has been distributed ahead of the census in Illinois..  “The way that we’re serving the counties is brand new, and the outreach efforts being broken down by community is brand new,” Anderson said.

In the lead up to April 1, when the count officially begins, TAKE will be working to spread the word about the census and how to complete it..  “Basically advertising for the census before it’s actually time to be counted,” Anderson said. “Just to get it on people’s minds and express how important it is.”.  People need to hear about the importance of the census between five and seven times before they will take action and complete it, Alvarez explained..  “The more they know what the stakes are, the more likely people are to go out and actually complete the census,” Alvarez said..  Once the count begins, organizing efforts will shift to providing places where people can respond to the census, like setting up computers and tablets in public spaces.","[0.5989390015602112, 0.4010609984397888]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5989390015602112

Schuerman settles on what he admits is a simple definition of gentrification: the process by which a neighborhood goes from having below-average to above-average incomes for its region. But he never really applies it. While he frequently asserts or implies that gentrification is exploding across cities, he doesn’t say how many neighborhoods actually meet his definition..  As a demographic researcher, I decided to check. Using U.S. Census data, I looked at the share of people in New York, San Francisco, and Chicago living in places that met Schuerman’s definition of having gentrified between 2000 and 2016. In New York, it’s 3.1 percent of residents. In San Francisco, the number is 4.4 percent. In Chicago, it’s 4.8 percent. Needless to say, this does not represent a vast swath. Although the numbers might increase if the time frame were extended, change at a generational pace is far less disruptive than change that takes place over a few years. Using Newcomers’ own definition, the story of urban America is not a tidal wave of gentrification but creeping racial and economic transition..  In fact, this aligns with the growing academic consensus that gentrification is much rarer than is commonly believed. This year alone, there have been no fewer than three national studies into the prevalence and location of gentrifying neighborhoods. (Disclosure: I authored one of these studies, for the University of Minnesota.) Despite using very different methods, all three studies roughly appear to agree that about 10 percent of neighborhoods in metro areas were gentrifying. Research has also tended to show that no matter how you measure gentrification in the urban core, it’s almost always more common to find neighborhoods afflicted by intensifying poverty. Out of the fifty biggest American regions, forty-four have core cities where the population in poverty has grown faster than the overall population since 2000. The only exceptions are New York City, Los Angeles, D.C., New Orleans, Atlanta, and Providence..  This issue of concentrated poverty has come up before on the blog through posts like this one about Detroit . The data is pretty clear: The number of high poverty Census tracts in the US is increasing faster than the number of gentrifying Census tracts (i.e. Census tracts that are becoming wealthier)..  So could it be that the problem isn’t actually gentrification? It is that, paradoxically, gentrification isn’t happening enough and more broadly, and that it is leading to rising inequality across our cities. That strikes me as being the greater issue..

But, it has also been losing population over recent years, including the loss of an estimated 7,000 people between 2017 and 2018 people from 2017 to 2018. The on-going loss threatens its third place standing, with cities such as Houston growing rapidly..  A recent article in the New York Times looked at Chicago’s population loss, and specifically the out-migration of African Americans from the city. According to an article in the Chicago Sun Times , the city’s African American population fell from 1.2 million in 1980 to less than 800,000 in 2019. To understand the significance of this population change, it is important to reflect back on previous shifts in the city’s population. Following the First World War, and up until the 1970s, the Great Migration saw the migration of some 6 million African Americans out of the south and into the northern states, lured by better employment opportunities in the north’s industrial and manufacturing sectors, with many of these migrants settling in Chicago or other cities such as New York, Detroit, and Buffalo. With shifts in the American economy, including de-industrialization, migration flows shifted in the 1970s, with a net in-migration of African Americans into the south – essentially reversing the trends seen in the Great Migration decades. Many of these migrants returned to their place of birth, a topic of a blog that I wrote on May 30, 2018 “Southbound: The Migration of African American’s to the US South.”.  While some of the African Americans migrating out of Chicago would have headed to the southern states (return migration) or elsewhere in the US, many also left the City of Chicago to settle in neighboring communities around Chicago. Like other migrants, families that are relocating close to the city are being forced out due to a mix of reasons, including increasing crime and violence, loss of jobs and employment opportunities, segregation, discriminatory policing, poor educational resources, high housing costs, and limited services. Critics have also blamed the Chicago Housing Authority, which did not build the number of units it said it would..  For Chicago, the implications are also numerous. First, its neighborhood structure and characteristics are changing and evolving. The risk is that lower income households will continue to be forced out as they are priced out of the housing market. Second, its shrinking population will increasingly make service provision more difficult or more expensive. Schools will close and services will leave, further disadvantaging neighborhoods. Third, the out-migration may leave behind a population is more divided in terms of income and opportunities. On the one hand, Chicago has continued to attract higher income and better educated individuals. On the other hand, those left behind may be poorer and more vulnerable, creating a growing disparity between the two extremes..  Ultimately, the key factor will be who moves in as African Americans move out. Zotti , for instance, notes that the number of African American graduates has been growing. Immigration also remains important source of population growth for the city, and younger adults including millenials are increasingly calling the city home, with some areas of the city seeing gains..

Chicago's bail reforms may not have had the rosy outcomes indicated by a top county judge's analysis, which independent researchers say is downplaying the new crimes that have resulted from allowing defendants to await trial outside of jail..  Those are the results of an analysis by a group of Chicago Tribune reporters in a new investigative piece as well as a just-published data analysis paper by University of Utah professors Paul Cassell and Richard Fowles..  In 2017, Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans implemented an order reforming how the Chicago area courts handled pretrial detention. The goal was to reduce the demands for cash bail, which tend to keep people trapped behind bars on the basis of poverty rather than risk. Cook County met its goal of detaining fewer defendants before their trials. The number of defendants who secured pretrial release between 2016 and 2018 jumped from 71.6 percent to 80.5 percent. When cash bail was ordered, the amount demanded was much lower than before. Cook County's jail population dropped from 7,443 to less than 6,000..  Last May, Evans released a report that showed releasing more defendants from jail did not put the community at greater risk of crime. A high proportion of defendants (83 percent) charged with felonies and released under the new system returned to court as ordered and did not commit new crimes while released. In all, Evans' report painted a positive picture that matched the narrative of those who support bail reform: That court systems in Cook County were accurately sorting defendants based on the risk they posed to public safety and their likelihood of showing up to trial, rather than simply leaving everyone in jail simply because they couldn't afford to pay what the courts ordered.

The federal census, however, shows a majority of the state’s population is female while 2016 exit polling showed the state’s Democratic electorate was 54% female..  The polling sample also did not accurately reflect the percentage of the vote that came from strongly Democratic Chicago compared with less Democratic suburbs and Downstate.

The slaughter might begin next week despite public opposition and offers to help with humane alternatives. Local activists, however, are not giving in and are still fighting to save the geese..  Next week, the geese begin their annual feather molt, and they will be unable to fly or escape, which is why it’s believed the cruel massacre might start then..  In Defense of Animals Wild Animals Campaigner, Lisa Levinson says: “If this monstrous plan moves forward, dozens of unsuspecting geese will be rounded up during molting season, while they are flightless and defenseless..  Most of the geese will be separated from their goslings and violently pushed into cages, while the rest will be left vulnerable, terrified, and traumatized — the ultimate in goose cruelty.”.  “TheUrbana Park District’s own reports show five years of steady improvement and a marked goose population decrease of 12% in the last two years using non-lethal strategies like habitat modification, nesting management, and humane hazing,”according to In Defense of Animals..

455,"Even before the Nevada caucuses put Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a commanding position among the Democratic presidential field, he was leading with Illinois voters, a statewide poll shows..  The Simon Poll, commissioned by the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University ahead of the March 17 primary, found Sanders favored by 22% of likely Democratic voters, followed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg with 17%, and former Vice President Joe Biden with 14%. Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg was at 13%, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 8% and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 6%..  Andrew Yang, who has since dropped out of the race, and businessman Tom Steyer each had 1%..  Charlie Leonard, visiting professor at the Simon institute, said there was nothing “particularly surprising” about the results, given what already played out in other states. While the results provide a “snapshot” of voter sentiment, he said it’s also “difficult to read too much” into the numbers..  Part of the reason, he said, was the sample margin of error. Customer Research International of San Marcos, Texas, surveyed 1,000 people Feb. 10-17 for the poll and only 821 identified themselves as likely voters. Some did not say if they would take a Democratic or Republican ballot. Leonard concluded the presidential preference question went only to likely voters of each party – 475 Democrats and 232 Republicans. The margin of error among Democrats in that calculation is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points, while among Republicans it is 6.4 percentage points..  John Jackson, visiting professor of political science at the Simon institute, said that he doubts the Nevada caucus outcome would have had a significant effect on the Illinois poll numbers, but he did say last week’s debate “might have shaved some margin off” Bloomberg’s numbers, though he still thinks the former New York mayor would have come in second..  “He’s still spending money like crazy,” Jackson said of Bloomberg, who has flooded the airwaves with advertising and opened offices in the state..  Leonard said Illinois’ primary could play a role in the national presidential picture on the Democratic side. The Illinois vote comes after several other contests, including Super Tuesday primaries in more than a dozen states on March 3..  “Every primary henceforth is going to bring a little more clarity to the presidential race,” Leonard said. “I think Super Tuesday will decide a lot, and Illinois’ primary will come in behind that and maybe do some consolidating and mopping up.”.  A Chicago Tribune story published online Monday raised questions about the Simon Poll’s methodology and accuracy. For example, the Tribune reported, the 1,000 registered voters who took part in the poll included 56% men and 44% women, but the federal census shows a majority of the state’s population is female. The newspaper also reported that only a quarter of the poll’s Democratic votes came from Chicago, while in 2016, Chicago accounted for 35% of the state’s Democratic primary turnout..  Jackson said there’s no evidence that the way the poll was conducted skewed results. “We think our basic findings are essentially accurate,” he said..  On the Republican side, the poll only mentioned two presidential candidates — President Donald Trump and former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld. While Weld is still in the race nationally, he did not file to run in Illinois. The only primary competition Trump faces on the Illinois ballot is from little-known Rocky De La Fuente of San Diego. In the Simon poll, Trump received 89% to 4% for Weld..  Overall, 39% of Illinois voters approved of Trump's job performance to 58% who disapproved. Among Republicans, approval for the president was 87% to 12% disapproval. Among Democrats, 92% disapprove and 7% approve. Among independents, 43% approve and 52% disapprove..  All 1,000 voters were asked their views of Gov. JB Pritzker, who is in the middle of a four-year term, and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, of Springfield, who is running for a new six-year term but is unopposed in the primary..  The poll found 51% of respondents approved of Pritzker’s job performance and 38% disapproved. Among Democrats, Pritzker’s approval-disapproval was 77% and 14% respectively. Among Republicans, 73% disapproved and 20% approved. Independents split, with 44% approving and 43% disapproving..  The Pritzker overall approval rate is up 11 points from a 2019 Simon Poll, when the governor had been in office just two months. At that time, he received 40% approval to 38% disapproval..  Durbin received 52% approval overall to 36% disapproval. Among Democrats, approval versus disapproval for Durbin was 79% to 12%. Seventy percent of Republicans disapprove of his job to 20% who approve..  Bernard Schoenburg: 217-788-1540, bernard.schoenburg@sj-r.com, @bschoenburg Never miss a story.

Advertisement Rylan Wilder, 15, lead guitarist and singer for the Monarchy Over Monday, was accidentally shot by a police officer chasing a bank robbery suspect. (Jared Callaway Photography) Chicago musicians reach out to teen guitarist whose arm was badly damaged after being accidentally shot by cop.  Chicago musicians are reaching out to Rylan Wilder , the 15-year-old guitarist whose arm was badly damaged by gunfire, offering support, encouragement and an open invitation to jam when he’s ready. Rylan was finishing up his shift at UpBeat Music and Arts when he was shot in the arm and abdomen by a police officer chasing a bank robber..  The bullet caused extensive damage to his arm, and his parents have said they don’t know if he’ll be able to play guitar again . Wilder is the singer and lead guitarist for the band Monarchy Over Monday, a RiotFest performer this past summer. A benefit show on Saturday at Martyrs’, where Wilders’ band had been scheduled to play, will help the teen’s family with medical bills. Exodus World Service volunteers Katie Schnizlein, left, and Theresa Stiven, center, spend time with Syrian refugees living in the urban settlements in Beirut, Lebanon, in September. (Heidi Zeiger / Exodus World Service) Fewer refugees allowed to come here, so Chicago volunteers are going overseas to help them.  During the final year of the Obama administration, the U.S. set the cap on refugee admissions at 110,000. This fall under President Trump, the limit on refugees allowed into the United States through next September is 18,000. For Chicago volunteers who helped refugees settle into the area, that’s not good enough. So they’re going overseas to meet refugees , where they are able to continue supporting them. Fairlife milk products are displayed Jan. 23, 2015, in the dairy section of an Indianapolis grocery store. Fairlife was launched in 2012 as a partnership between Coca-Cola, which distributes its products, and the Select Milk Producers, a co-op of dairy farms that includes Fair Oaks. Fairlife milk drinkers ‘feel betrayed’ after video of alleged cow abuse at Fair Oaks Farm, seek class-action lawsuit status.  Eight lawsuits filed by consumers are being consolidated into a single consumer fraud case against Chicago-based Fairlife, Coca-Cola and the dairy co-op that includes Fair Oaks Farm, the Indiana dairy farm where alleged cow abuse was caught on video by an animal welfare group and released this summer. One Chicago attorney representing one of the consumers said the potential class-action suit could include “millions” of consumers. John and Diana Minalt own and operate Conifera Tree Farm in Harvard and are shown on Nov. 27, 2019. The number of Christmas tree farmers is declining. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Christmas tree farmers are leaving the business at alarming rates. It could mean fewer options for consumers.  Across the U.S., Christmas tree farmers are getting out of the business. Illinois lost dozens of farmers in recent years , dropping from 212 growers in 2012 to 182 farmers in 2017, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture census data. The physical demands of tree farming can discourage growers from continuing the business, as can the amount of time (up to 10 years) it takes to turn a profit. And younger farmers aren’t taking the place of those retiring. Javi Rodriguez and Crystal Cuevas exchange vows during their wedding on Nov. 27, 2019.

Family members and hospital staff squeezed into a chapel in a corner of the University of Chicago Medical Center this week to celebrate the wedding of a 23-year-old patient about to be discharged to go into hospice care. Javier Rodriguez, known to his friends and family as Javi, has familial dilated cardiomyopathy, a genetic disease that predisposes victims to develop heart failure at a young age..  He has several days, possibly weeks, left to live, his current physician, Dr. Bryan Smith, said.

(Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) With the census deadline looming, responses in the city of Chicago are still substantially behind the rest of the state, particularly in communities of color that stand to be hit the hardest by the consequences of an undercount. While the state’s response rate stands at 70%, slightly higher than the national average, the city’s rate remains just under 59%, with some neighborhoods around 30%. Advertisement The census data will be used to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars in federal aid each year for the next decade. Some of the lowest rates in Chicago are in areas that have struggled with poverty and a lack of resources: Back of the Yards, West Englewood, Little Village and North Lawndale. “The potential negative impact is just really widening some of those inequities across the region,” warned Erin Aleman, executive director of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, which recently completed a study of response rates. Advertisement Census response representative Peggy Bibbs collects responses from citizens at a 2020 census community giveaway day hosted by Metropolitan Family Services on Chicago's Northwest Side on Friday, Sept. 11, 2020. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) “The disparities that currently exist have the potential to worsen if there are less resources available based on undercounts,” he said. Across the region, CMAP found that Hispanic communities are registering the biggest drop in participation from 2010, with average declines of more than seven percentage points. Aleman cited the CARES Act, which provides COVID-19 relief, as a prime example of what a census undercount could mean. CMAP’s study estimated Illinois would have lost $235.5 million in COVID-19 aid if its population had been just 5% lower. He noted that communities with low response rates have been some of the hardest hit by the pandemic. When it released its study, CMAP also circulated a “social media tool kit” to help organizations boost the count in their communities in the final weeks. The usual deadline for the census is in July, but it was initially extended to Oct. 31 because of the pandemic. That was later changed to Sept. 30, but a coalition of civil rights organizations and local governments is suing the Census Bureau, demanding an extension. Last Saturday, a federal judge in California issued a temporary restraining order preventing the agency from winding down operations until a hearing on Sept. 17. Ellisa Johnson, deputy regional director for the Census Bureau in Chicago, said her office is “pulling out all the stops,” making sure workers are deployed to areas of high foot traffic and into communities with low response rates. Johnson said the bureau will be primarily focused on its “mobile questionnaire assistance” program, which places census workers outside common areas like grocery stores or CTA platforms where people can fill out the census on the spot. “It’s a once in every 10-year opportunity for your voice to be heard... and once that window closes … the opportunity to be counted is over,” Johnson said. “It is simply not too late.” Community organizations, meanwhile, are making their own plans for a final push but say their efforts are being complicated by fear and distrust. Jesus Martinez, the census organizer for the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, said he has been conducting outreach work in the community for months and found existing barriers have only been exasperated by the pandemic. Advertisement “We are working within communities that have been neglected,” Martinez said. “These are communities that have been traditionally undercounted, and it is a result of having a federal government that terrorizes them, that makes the immigrant community feel that they’re not welcome here.” Given the economic conditions, the census is an afterthought for many families that are preoccupied with survival right now, he said. Over the summer, Martinez worked with other community organizations to ensure census workers were present at events like neighborhood food distributions. And this month, Martinez and the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council are planning community events across the South and West side to draw people out and educate them on the census. Although there is no citizenship question on the census forms, initial efforts to include one have had long-lasting effects on outreach efforts. Martinez said much of his work has centered around combating misinformation and reassuring people the census is safe.

Maria Fitzsimmons, census director for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, echoed Martinez’s concerns that the federal government has made immigrant communities “hard to count.” “It’s a manufactured crisis of confidence in this really important part of the constitution,” Fitzsimmons said.

SPRINGFIELD – The number of Illinois residents who will give the ultimate gift has reached 7 million. That’s according to Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White, who said the State’s organ and tissue donor registry has reached a new milestone..  “I am so proud that Illinoisans continue to show their giving spirit and commitment to others by signing up for this lifesaving program,” said White. “Our mission is to strengthen the Organ/Tissue Donor Program through outreach and registration initiatives. We want to end the waiting for the approximately 4,000 people statewide. Each year about 300 people die waiting for a transplant in Illinois.”.  There are 10,764,540 individuals in Illinois who qualify to become organ/tissue donors. Of those, 65 percent have registered as organ/tissue donors. There are more than 12.6 million people living in Illinois, according to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2019..  In addition, more than 100,000 16- and 17-year-olds have registered with the program since 2018 when Secretary White initiated a law allowing them to register as organ and tissue donors..  “I believe our public awareness campaign, including television, radio and social media ads have helped encourage people to register,” said White. “It takes less than a minute to register and one person can improve the quality of life for up to 25 people.”.  Secretary White heads the state’s Organ/Tissue Donor Registry. The lifesaving program has been one of his top priorities during his 21-year administration. He has visited countless hospitals, schools, libraries, Driver Service facilities as well as other venues to promote and register Illinoisans for the donor program. Secretary White has a personal connection to organ donation because his sister, Doris Ivy, received a kidney transplant from an anonymous donor that extended her life for 27 years..

468,"A pair of veteran lawmakers have been campaigning furiously to take over from retiring Senate President John Cullerton as Democrats gather Sunday to choose the chamber’s next leader at a pivotal point in Springfield..  Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford of Maywood and Assistant Majority Leader Don Harmon of Oak Park are competing to become the Senate’s first new leader in 11 years as a federal corruption investigation cloaks the statehouse in unease after a spring session where Democrats celebrated a number of legislative victories..  Advertisement Lightford would be the first woman to lead either chamber of the General Assembly and the third African American Senate president. For Harmon, it’s another chance at a role he sought over a decade ago, when Cullerton won the job after Emil Jones retired..  In addition to dealing with any further fallout from the federal probe, the new Senate leader will have to navigate headwinds on a number of issues in the spring legislative session and beyond, from property tax relief to Illinois’ massive pension debt, as well as the monumental task of redrawing legislative district boundaries after the 2020 census..  Heading into Sunday’s vote, neither Lightford nor Harmon appeared to have rounded up the 30 votes needed to be elected as the next Senate president, despite two months of one-on-one meetings with fellow senators across the state and fierce behind-the-scenes campaigning..  As the contenders and their backers have lobbied for support, other senators have looked for assurances about their roles in a new regime, seeking leadership positions, committee chairmanships or promises on legislative priorities..  “It’s been very tense,” said Sen. Robert Peters, a second-year Chicago Democrat who on Thursday said he still hadn’t made up his mind. “Very, very tense.”.  Lightford, 51, was first elected to the Senate in 1998, when Republicans controlled the chamber under the leadership of Senate President James “Pate” Philip of Wood Dale. At 30, she was the youngest African American woman ever elected to the upper chamber.","[0.6904045343399048, 0.30959540605545044]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6904045343399048

478,".  I’m happy to read the Tribune acknowledging the public pension problem in Illinois (Will a 6 th year of population loss jolt voters to change?, Dec. 31), but I can’t believe what they said..  The Tribune is quite willing to keep the current pension system in place as long as we can change it for future retirees..  The current pension system is already bankrupting the state. If it stopped paying any future public employee retirees, the state will still fall deeper and deeper in debt..  Why can’t the state admit that it made a mistake? The current pension system is unsustainable..  They won’t admit it, because they don’t have to. Residents need to keep writing Springfield telling them to fix this. And the Republican Party needs to step up and offer alternative candidates for those who won’t fix this..

479,"Illinois lost nearly 105,000 people in net domestic migration between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2019, according to new numbers released Monday by the U.S. Census Bureau. In total, the Land of Lincoln lost on net 51,250 people, the largest annual population decline this decade. It’s the sixth consecutive year Illinois’ population declined. The 51,250 in net population loss is roughly the size of the village of Hoffman Estates in suburban Chicago or Normal in downstate McLean County. Last year, Illinois dropped from the fifth to the sixth most populous state, losing an estimated 45,000 people and falling behind Pennsylvania. In 2017, Illinois lost around 40,000 people. In 2016, there was a loss around 38,000 people. In 2015, there was a loss of around 25,000. In 2014, there was a loss of around 10,000. The cumulative total is almost 160,000 lost from Illinois in the past ten years. “It’s kind of a disturbing trend because we’re looking at if it holds out next year that we’ll probably be losing at least one congressional seat so that certainly cuts into our congressional representation,” Northern Illinois University Senior Research Associate Brian Harger said Monday. “It also impacts some of our eligibility for federal aid.” When it comes to Illinoisans moving out of the state, there were nearly 105,000 people lost. Harger said that’s fewer lost to other states than in previous years. “The birth rate historically has acted kind of as a buffer in our losses in other areas,” Harger said. “That’s not the case anymore.” Harger said Illinois’ neighbors continue to grow while Illinois shrinks. “Iowa for example gained about 6,500 people and Iowa is a fairly small state, it’s a population about a third of the size of Illinois,” he said. “Indiana seems to be one of the bigger gainers. They gained about 37,000.” Harger said Michigan is still growing but at a slower pace. As to why people are leaving Illinois, Harger said it’s all anecdotal. “The weather has always been what it’s been, it’s hot in the summer and cold in the winter,” Harger said. “But economic factors certainly play into that. Job creation and job growth figures do play a role in that. People move to where there’s opportunity. Illinois has struggled economically since the last recession in particular as far as creating jobs so that obviously is not an attractive factor to people.” The U.S. Census announced the numbers nationally on Monday. According to national and state population estimates, 42 states and the District of Columbia had fewer births in 2019 than 2018. “While natural increase is the biggest contributor to the U.S. population increase, it has been slowing over the last five years,” said Dr. Sandra Johnson, a demographer/statistician in the Population Division of the Census Bureau. “Natural increase, or when the number of births is greater than the number of deaths, dropped below 1 million in 2019 for the first time in decades.” The Census said the nation’s population was 328.2 million, growing by 0.5 percent over the year, or by nearly 1.6 million people. On net domestic migration, Illinois lost 104,986 in 2019, coming behind net domestic migration losses in California (-203,414) and New York (-180,649).","[0.6727144718170166, 0.3272855281829834]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6727144718170166

This house on Carmen Avenue in Lincoln Square sold for $609,000 in October..  Home price growth has slowed to a crawl in Chicago, while nationwide it’s picking up speed, according to new data..  Chicago-area single-family home values grew by 0.5 percent in October compared with the same month in 2018, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices released this morning. It’s the second consecutive month of growth at less than 1 percent; the figure for September was 0.6 percent..  A year ago, home prices here were consistently growing in the 3 percent range, or about six times the current rate. Nationally, prices were growing in the 6 percent range. Price growth has slowed both locally and nationally in 2019..  In the latest report, national home price growth was 3.3 percent in October, the fourth consecutive month when it was above June’s 3.1 percent..  By comparison, the Chicago figure has been dropping since June, from 1.5 percent to the latest figure, 0.5 percent..  Among the pressures holding down Chicago’s home price growth are high property taxes and the fear of further increases, which make buyers hesitant to pay high home prices; population loss, which reduces demand for homes, and the 2017 federal tax bill’s sharp reduction in the state and local taxes that Illinois homeowners can deduct..  On a nationwide basis, the index data for October was “reassuring,” Craig Lazzara, managing director and global head of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in prepared comments that accompanied the data..  “As was the case last month, after a long period of decelerating price increases, the national, 10-city, and 20-city composites all rose at a modestly faster rate in October compared to September,"" Lazzara said in the comments. ""This stability was broad-based, reflecting data in 12 of 20 cities. It is, of course, still too soon to say whether this marks an end to the deceleration or is merely a pause in the longer-term trend.”.  Since Chicago home values turned positive in November 2012, according to the index, there have been only three other months besides September and October when the Chicago figure was below 1 percent: November 2012 (0.8 percent) and August and September 2015 (both 0.9 percent)..  Of 20 major U.S. metropolitan areas that the index tracks, only one had a weaker showing in the latest report. In San Francisco, home values were down 0.4 percent in October. Even that figure was an improvement: last month, home values were down 0.7 percent in San Francisco..  Chicago’s home values in October were still about 12.5 percent below their 2006 peak, according to the indices, while nationwide home values are 15 percent above their boom-years peak.

492,"Illinois has dropped to the sixth most populated state, with Pennsylvania taking over the fifth spot. For the past five years, big cities like Chicago, as well as other large metropolitan areas, have been associated with the American dream. However, residents have also been regularly leaving these big metro cities in swarms for a life of lower prices, less crime, and more job opportunities..  In 2019, Illinois lost 51,250 people with many leaving from the Chicago area. A shrinking population creates a host of headaches, including a smaller tax base and a weaker economic engine. Because many federal contributions are based on population size, many cities can suffer a double whammy from smaller and fewer appropriations..  Shrinking cities can end up in a negative feedback loop. Since a smaller tax base can lead to higher taxes on the remaining residents, some may grow frustrated and depart for the suburbs or cheaper cities/states. That then puts even more pressure on city leaders to raise taxes on the remaining residents, keeping the cycle going..  That’s one of the major problems facing Chicago, the biggest city in Illinois, a state that lost perhaps more residents than any other state last year. Illinois’ financial crunch has prompted some observers to suggest it could be one of the first states to file for bankruptcy protection. The population in the Chicagoland metropolitan area declined 0.3 percent to approximately 9.5 million people. Chicago’s shrinking population reflects a loss that will also hurt the entire state of Illinois. The media adage “as goes the economic problems for Chicago, the rest of the state will follow” does apply in the tax and political arena..  Chicago’s population is likely to keep declining over the next few years, according to a Chicago media report. Residents complain about high taxes, the financial stresses on the state, the crime rate and harsh weather. Lack of services and/or higher fees for services challenge homeowners and renters..  This plight also is affecting smaller cities like DeKalb, Illinois. With an increase in local crime, a declining university enrollment, higher taxes on various real estate and the lack of quality paying jobs, the city has seen a decline in middle-class residents. With county and city taxes, DeKalb County is ranked as one of the top three counties in the state of Illinois for taxes..  “I contend that for a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle. “ – Winston Churchill TAGS","[0.7955856323242188, 0.20441436767578125]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.7955856323242188
493,"By: Mark Glennon* Chicago in the 1920s..  I still remember the smiles on my grandparents’ faces when they described the 1920s. They were in Chicago then, which was perhaps the most rip-roaring center of dynamism and opportunity on the planet in what seemed like the best of times..  I wish I were writing why this decade promises to be the same, but that’s not to be..  Instead, this is the time to address the most frequent theme we see in comments on this site and emails we get, which is the coming resolution of Illinois’ state and local fiscal crisis. That crisis will resolve one way or another over the course of this decade. We know that because simple math says it must..  By “resolve” I’m not implying anything benign. I mean what you readers have called it here – a meltdown, big bang, crash, finale. Call it what you want. We’ve used those terms, too, though sometimes in different ways..  Just “let it blow up” is a common sentiment. Why bother suggesting reforms, many have asked, when the political establishment has no interest in reforms? It’s too late anyway now, with or without reforms, others say..  Here’s our view, which we emphasize because it’s key to our purpose: The meltdown should neither be accelerated by artificial pessimism nor delayed by artificial optimism. A meltdown, however, is both necessary and inevitable..  By meltdown I mean a crash in Illinois’ state and local public sector severe enough to shock the public and the political establishment into drastic reform. If a crash was artificially accelerated by deliberate action or misinformation, politicians would dismiss it as such.

494,"By: Mark Glennon* Chicago in the 1920s..  I still remember the smiles on my grandparents’ faces when they described the 1920s. They were in Chicago then, which was perhaps the most rip-roaring center of dynamism and opportunity on the planet in what seemed like the best of times..  I wish I were writing why this decade promises to be the same, but that’s not to be..  Instead, this is the time to address the most frequent theme we see in comments on this site and emails we get, which is the coming resolution of Illinois’ state and local fiscal crisis. That crisis will resolve one way or another over the course of this decade. We know that because simple math says it must..  By “resolve” I’m not implying anything benign. I mean what you readers have called it here – a meltdown, big bang, crash, finale. Call it what you want. We’ve used those terms, too, though sometimes in different ways..  Just “let it blow up” is a common sentiment. Why bother suggesting reforms, many have asked, when the political establishment has no interest in reforms? It’s too late anyway now, with or without reforms, others say..  Here’s our view, which we emphasize because it’s key to our purpose: The meltdown should neither be accelerated by artificial pessimism nor delayed by artificial optimism. A meltdown, however, is both necessary and inevitable..  By meltdown I mean a crash in Illinois’ state and local public sector severe enough to shock the public and the political establishment into drastic reform. If a crash was artificially accelerated by deliberate action or misinformation, politicians would dismiss it as such. Today, the establishment still covers up the depth of our problems — by lying — and it would be a mistake to arm them with something better..  And the meltdown indeed must be severe enough to induce shock, because decades of experience show how impervious Illinois voters and lawmakers are to financial reality..

495,".  thehill | Another sudden and unexpected factor will transform this year’s elections. Many states, cities and counties are about to, suddenly, run out of money. Wages won’t be paid. Services won’t be delivered. Institutions will shut down abruptly. Many state colleges may fold. And yet most state and local political and administrative leaders just sit and watch. Voters will not be pleased..  Millions of American workers filed for unemployment insurance during the past two weeks. That is a record and represents a collapse of our local economies. Across the country, in every state, county and city, businesses have been shut down, and many will not return after the coronavirus crisis is over. Tens of millions have lost jobs, homes, savings and retirement incomes that will never return. Owners of rental property will go under when their loan payments come due and renters can’t pay. Across the country, state and local economies are being badly damaged — many of them permanently..  The result is that state and local tax revenues will plummet. States and localities will burn through any reserves they’ve maintained like wildfire. Since most of our politicians and government managers have been raised during a decade of expanding economies, their first instinct will be to wait and then panic and then raise taxes to cover shortfalls — perhaps a special “coronavirus surtax.” Taxpayers across the country have tolerated various forms of high state and local taxes; the politicians would naturally ask, “Why should now be any different?”.  But it is different. The resulting increased tax burden would be a disaster. Businesses that were barely hanging on would go under. Workers and homeowners who were barely surviving would go under. State and local tax bases would collapse even faster. There would be social unrest, possibly requiring martial law . People would migrate from high-tax states toward new jobs, accelerating a downward spiral. These large migrations would make the 2020 census results nonsense..  The only answer for the states, counties and cities that want to survive is to slash budgets now — probably 30 to 50 percent — eliminate all nonessential spending and reduce taxes today. Business leaders know that, in these types of situations, the only way to save a company is to cut costs immediately. There is no other answer, and those who act first and most aggressively are the most successful in saving the company and the greatest number of its employees. In short, “fiscal distancing” — that is, separating politicians from taxpayers’ money by cutting budgets and taxes now — is literally the only useful thing that state and local governments can do to prevent further economic and social catastrophe.

497,"Illinois Unemployment Rate Up, Payroll Jobs Down in March at Start of COVID-19 Outbreak / MyRadioLink.com April 16, 2020 12:19 pm.  SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) announced today that the unemployment rate rose +1.2 percentage points to 4.6 percent, while nonfarm payrolls lost -34,100 jobs in March. This reflects the initial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Illinois businesses and households, based on preliminary data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and released by IDES. The February monthly change in payrolls was revised from the preliminary report from -200 to -11,400 jobs..  The March payroll jobs estimate and unemployment rate reflects activity for the week including the 12th. The payroll periods of some employers in the establishment survey may have extended beyond the week including the 12th. Also, those classified as unemployed included persons who reported they were away from work during the week including the 12th due to COVID-19 even if they were paid for that week. BLS has published FAQs for March payroll jobs and the unemployment rate..  The state’s unemployment rate was +0.2 percentage point higher than the national unemployment rate reported for March, which was 4.4 percent, up +0.9 percentage point from the previous month. The Illinois unemployment rate was up +0.3 percentage point from a year ago when it was 4.3 percent..  The three-month average Illinois payroll employment estimate, which provides a more stable measure of payroll employment change, was down -9,900 jobs during the January to March three-month period, compared to the December to February three-month period. The largest average declines were found in Leisure and Hospitality (-5,300), Professional and Business Services (-3,700) and Financial Activities (-900)..  “As the COVID-19 outbreak unfolded, this administration moved quickly to overhaul our systems, expand access to benefits, and implement new programs providing working families with the support they need,” said Deputy Governor Dan Hynes. “We will continue using every tool available to help workers, families, and small businesses face these unprecedented challenges as we keep our communities safe.”.  “As Illinois moves to confront this crisis, we are encouraged Governor Pritzker moved boldly to lay an economic foundation for future growth,” said Erin Guthrie, Acting Director of the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. “This administration’s focus on workforce development, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating new industries will help us emerge from this crisis and rebuild.”.  Compared to a year ago, nonfarm payroll employment decreased by -29,900 jobs with the biggest losses in: Professional and Business Services (-21,700), Manufacturing (-14,700) and Leisure and Hospitality (-13,000). The industry sectors with the largest over-the-year increases were: Educational and Health Services (+12,800), Government (+12,800), and Other Services (+2,200). Illinois nonfarm payrolls were down -0.5 percentage point over-the-year as compared to the nation’s +1.0 percent over-the-year gain in March..  The number of unemployed workers increased sharply from the prior month, +33.6 percent to 292,300 and was up +5.6 percent over the same month for the prior year. The labor force was down -1.1 percent over-the-month and -2.0 percent over-the-year. The unemployment rate identifies those individuals who are out of work and seeking employment..  An individual who exhausts or is ineligible for benefits is still reflected in the unemployment rate if they actively seek work. IDES maintains the state’s largest job search engine, Illinois Job Link (IJL), to help connect jobseekers to employers who are hiring, which recently showed 147,823 posted resumes with 70,881 jobs available..

499,"May 6, 11 AM UTC Listen 3:54.  Lucila Gallardo stood in line outside Project Vida, in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood, this past Saturday morning. She was patiently waiting to be tested for COVID-19..  Gallardo’s husband, with the help of a cane, was standing in front of her. And her daughter needed to be tested, too. The family went to two other COVID-19 testing locations earlier that morning, but they were turned away because those sites were at capacity..  Gallardo said she was lucky her family was not turned away from this new COVID-19 test site located in a tent outside Project Vida. The AIDS prevention organization partnered with Howard Brown Health to provide free tests to this community..  “When we got there, the man behind me was told to come back another day,” Gallardo said in Spanish. “I told the woman next to me we’re very fortunate. God sent us a sliver of hope by helping us make the decision to come here. It wasn’t a sliver of hope, God illuminated us.”.  Gallardo lives with her husband in Pilsen, but they moved in temporarily with her daughter who lives in Cicero. They didn’t have symptoms, but her daughter works in the office of a warehouse where a COVID-19 case was reported..  Gallardo and her husband are at risk. She’s 62 years old, and her husband is 74. He has a history of medical complications that include open heart surgery and recent knee surgery..  “I got worried,” she said. “We don’t share the same bathroom or bedroom but regardless, it is necessary to get tested.”.  In the last few weeks, 614 people have been tested at this location. And about 57% of them tested positive, said Jerome Montgomery, executive director of Project Vida..  In Cook County, the ZIP codes most impacted by COVID-19 are not among those receiving the highest rates of testing, according to a WBEZ analysis of data from the Illinois Department of Public Health and the U.S. Census Bureau. And those ZIP codes are in Latino neighborhoods, which possess the highest and fastest-growing rates of COVID-19 in Cook County. Read more : Find the latest COVID-19 case counts and case demographics for your ZIP code..  This test site is located in the 60623 ZIP code that includes most of Chicago’s Little Village and North Lawndale communities. As of Monday, the 60623 ZIP code ranked first in both the rate of confirmed cases (38.09 per 1,000 residents) and the percentage of confirmed cases of the total tested (46.6%) among Cook County ZIP codes, according to the WBEZ analysis..  But that same ZIP code lags in COVID-19 testing. The ZIP code ranked 50th in Cook County in the total tested per 1,000 residents, according to the analysis..  In fact, the five ZIP codes that rank among the county’s top 10 for both the rate of confirmed cases per 1,000 residents and the percentage of confirmed cases among the total tested are all mostly Latino areas. Three of those ZIP codes are in Chicago and include the Little Village, Brighton Park, Hermosa and Belmont Cragin communities. The other two are located in west suburban Cicero and Stone Park. But none of these ZIP codes rank in the top 35 for COVID-19 testing per 1,000 residents..  In recent weeks, COVID-19 cases have exploded in mostly Latino ZIP codes in Cook County. From April 20 to May 4, the number of confirmed cases in those areas nearly tripled — from 4,000 to 11,700, according to the WBEZ analysis. That’s twice as fast as the combined growth rate for all other ZIP codes in the county..  The need for more testing in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood was clear last Saturday. The test site opened at 10 a.m. and, within 30 minutes, workers were already turning residents away..  “We’ve averaging about 100 tests a day, and we ended up having to turn away a significant number of individuals each day, as well,” Montgomery said..  The majority of people who tested positive for COVID-19 did not show symptoms, Montgomery said. Testing is important to identify those with the virus, so that they can be isolated and prevented from spreading it..  Montgomery said free testing is needed in this neighborhood because many immigrants are not insured or they’re underinsured..  This community faces additional challenges. Montgomery said undocumented immigrants are terrified of asking for help, if they’re sick. And many residents are still working and living in multigenerational households, which can lead to the spread of the virus. Paramedics transport a woman who passed out while waiting in line to receive a COVID-19 test at a free testing site in Little Village in May. María Inés Zamudio / WBEZ News.  On Saturday, another woman waiting to be tested at the Project Vida site was too weak to stand in line. Workers gave her a place to sit, but then she passed out. When health care workers checked her vitals, her oxygen levels were low. A few minutes later, firefighters arrived and an ambulance took her to the hospital..  Montgomery said that’s not uncommon. He’s had to call the ambulance multiple times..  He said we can’t afford to ignore this community. Unlike poverty and crime, COVID-19 doesn’t respect neighborhood boundaries..  “Without having access to care, that impacts everyone and not just a specific population,” he said..

Advocates for their proposal claim higher tax rates are “modern” and people will stay and pay those rates. Really?.  Consider a recent study by SmartAsset, a financial website, of the states to which high income millennials, the next generation of entrepreneurs and leaders, are moving. Illinois is among the least attractive states for millennials; only one other state is more unattractive..  So, what’s driving this migration of the young and ambitious? Truth in Accounting’s Bill Bergman compared the 10 most attractive states in the SmartAsset study to the 10 least attractive states according to several factors, including average winter temperature. He found that average winter weather is not a statistically significant factor in choices by millennials..  The factors with the greatest statistical significance pertain to governance : Millennials are moving away from states that have more lawyers per capita (a proxy for regulatory burdens) and higher taxpayer burdens, both in terms of current taxation and expected future burdens based on indebtedness. They are moving to states with fewer rules and less-costly government..  This result is consonant with common sense: People look for values in all areas of their lives -- why not with respect to governance as well?.  Illinois, which ranked second-to-last in the SmartAsset study , also ranked second-to-last in Truth in Accounting’s latest “State of the States” study of state government finances. Truth in Accounting ’s “Taxpayer Burden” measures unfunded government obligations, including bonded debt and government employee retirement benefit promises. It represents the burden that past politicians have accumulated and loaded on future taxpayers, such as millennials..  In a recent Gallup poll, Illinois ranked dead last in the 50 states on trust in state government . Public corruption plays a big role in that ranking, of course, but trust in Illinois government management of finances also helps explain why people have been voting with their feet..  Does anyone actually believe that raising taxes further, and thereby raising the cost of living, of building a business or raising a family here, will make Illinois a more attractive place to live?

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, from 1900 until 1970, when Illinois amended its Constitution to authorize an income tax and to prohibit future reforms of public pensions, Illinois was among the fastest growing states in the country. Since then, the population growth faded, and then Illinois started to shrink as its tax burden and indebtedness continued to grow..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker and House Speaker Michael Madigan are working together to amend the state constitution to increase the tax burden even further. Advocates for their proposal claim higher tax rates are “modern” and people will stay and pay those rates. Really?.  Consider a recent study by SmartAsset, a financial website, of the states to which high income millennials, the next generation of entrepreneurs and leaders, are moving. Illinois is among the least attractive states for millennials; only one other state is more unattractive..  So, what’s driving this migration of the young and ambitious? Truth in Accounting’s Bill Bergman compared the 10 most attractive states in the SmartAsset study to the 10 least attractive states according to several factors, including average winter temperature. He found that average winter weather is not a statistically significant factor in choices by millennials..  The factors with the greatest statistical significance pertain to governance : Millennials are moving away from states that have more lawyers per capita (a proxy for regulatory burdens) and higher taxpayer burdens, both in terms of current taxation and expected future burdens based on indebtedness. They are moving to states with fewer rules and less-costly government..  This result is consonant with common sense: People look for values in all areas of their lives -- why not with respect to governance as well?.  Illinois, which ranked second-to-last in the SmartAsset study , also ranked second-to-last in Truth in Accounting’s latest “State of the States” study of state government finances. Truth in Accounting ’s “Taxpayer Burden” measures unfunded government obligations, including bonded debt and government employee retirement benefit promises. It represents the burden that past politicians have accumulated and loaded on future taxpayers, such as millennials..  In a recent Gallup poll, Illinois ranked dead last in the 50 states on trust in state government . Public corruption plays a big role in that ranking, of course, but trust in Illinois government management of finances also helps explain why people have been voting with their feet..  Does anyone actually believe that raising taxes further, and thereby raising the cost of living, of building a business or raising a family here, will make Illinois a more attractive place to live? Not likely: The proposed tax hike would exacerbate the Illinois Exodus, further reducing property market values and increasing the expected tax burden on those who remain..  Richard W.

The Illinois Constitution requires that once every decade, after the decennial census, legislators get together to draw political boundaries that affect state House and Senate and U.S. House districts. The process has been required since the U.S. Supreme Court’s “one person, one vote” decision in 1964. In that landmark case, the court required that legislative districts represent equal numbers of people. Every decade, districts were to be redrawn based on the new census figures..  The process has been hijacked by partisan politics. It’s not just Illinois. Across the country, whichever political party is in charge in a state gets to draw the maps, and those politicians draw the maps to favor themselves and their friends..  Maps are drawn so that the party in power can have as many like-minded folks within the boundaries as possible, which creates easy wins for incumbents.

507,"Women’s March Chicago to honor top female elected officials at Jan. 18 march RTM Staff Women’s March Chicago to Honor Top Female Elected Officials and Marchers With Disabilities.  at January 18th Anniversary March.  CHICAGO , Illinois, January 9, 2020 — Women’s March Chicago will proudly celebrate the historic number of women that Illinois voters swept into office at the city, county, state and national levels, while also honoring marchers with disabilities at its Anniversary March on Saturday, January 18 in Grant Park. Currently confirmed to lead the iconic March are: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot; Congresswomen Robin Kelly and Jan Schakowsky; Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle; Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx; Illinois State Comptroller Susana Mendoza; City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin; Illinois Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford; and City Clerk Anna Valencia. Each official will also serve as an honorary “Wayfinder,” assisting marchers with disabilities as they make their way from Grant Park to Federal Plaza. “Our marchers have worked tirelessly since we first marched in 2017 to ensure that a record number of women — and notably women of color — ran for and made it into office at every level,” says Jaquie Algee, WMC board president. “We will convene in Grant Park on January 18th to celebrate this historic accomplishment and to re-energize for all of the work we have ahead in 2020!” WMC, which makes accessibility a priority at its events, also will honor its marchers with disabilities. They will lead the March — which kicks off at 11 a.m. — alongside the elected female officials. Due to Chicago ’s unpredictable weather, the event will follow a “March only” format for the first time. With the absence of a rally and the lack of a designated seating area, organizers launched an all-new “Wayfinder” program , where volunteers will direct and accompany those needing assistance along the March route. “We want everyone to enjoy the day and be a part of this amazing, ongoing movement,” says Ann Scholhamer, board member and accessibility lead. “We want our marchers with disabilities focusing on the issues that matter to them most, and not on logistical details such as moving through the crowd or finding their way to their meeting point after the March.” The Anniversary March will also focus on a “Gallery of Issues.” Selecting from a myriad of progressive concerns, WMC chose five critical topics: the 2020 Census ; climate justice ; gun violence prevention ; health care access ; and voting . Along the lively and interactive March route, WMC and partner organizations will cheer on marchers, display banners and signage, engage in text message campaigns, hand out branded swag and more. “Marchers will learn and engage around these issues,” says Dr. Dilara Sayeed, board member and programming lead. “However, because our marchers are passionate about a multitude of causes, we are encouraging people to come out and raise their voices — and their signs — about any and all issues that matter to them, and then continue to activate and mobilize throughout 2020.” Grant Park will open at 9 a.m. on March day. The general March entrance will be located at Columbus Drive and Ida B. Wells Drive. Persons with disabilities will enter at Monroe Street and Columbus Drive and will be directed to a designated Accessible Gathering Area. WMC’s 2020 Anniversary March is generously sponsored by SEIU Illinois State Council.

508,"An analysis of population trends now suggests Illinois will only lose one seat in Congress. Illinois has lost tens of thousands in total population count since 2010, when the last U.S. Census count took place. The latest Census figures showed the state’s population declined by 51,000. Among other downsides, the population losses mean fewer members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Congressional seats are apportioned based on how the national population is split between states by the decennial U.S. Census.

512,"Populations make comeback in Illinois from decades ago Populations make comeback in Illinois from decades ago By Michael Urbanec Follow Tom Sistak for Shaw Media Caption Deer graze on a snowy day at Buffalo Rock State Park. There was a time when white-tailed deer, the state animal, were considered an endangered species but after 200 years of taking the proper steps, Illinois was able to rehabilitate it’s deer population to near overpopulation. Shaw Media file photo Caption A deer high-tails out of a cornfield near Catlin Park in LaSalle County in this undated photo..  If it seems like there are more deer in Illinois now than there were before, that’s because there are..  There was a time when white-tailed deer, the state animal, were considered an endangered species, but after 200 years of taking the proper steps, Illinois was able to rehabilitate it’s deer population to near overpopulation..  “What started out as a temporary moratorium ended up lasting over 50 years,” said Illinois Department of Natural Resource Wildlife Program Manager Dan Skinner. “From 1901 to 1957, with the return of our modern deer hunt, there was no white-tail deer hunt. At the same time, the Illinois State Game Commission was releasing deer from other areas to try and regrow the population.”.  When Illinois was initially settled by the French, they’d made quite a few conservation efforts to prevent deforestation and limit fort construction, but those efforts were ignored after the French lost control..  “When white settlers arrived in Illinois early in the 18th century, deer were common here, but probably not numerous,” wrote Lysle R. Pietsch in a 1954 study titled “White-Tailed Deer Populations in Illinois.”“At that time the native vegetation consisted largely of extensive areas of two basic types of plant communities, the prairie and the hardwood forest.”.  Pietsch said the edges where the forest met the prairies were where deer were found in large numbers..  The 1850s saw deer and buffalo populations decrease throughout the Midwest, and even though Illinois legislators put a law in place in 1853, outlawing the hunting of deer to protect the population. A brutal 1855-56 winter led people to ignore the law because they needed food..  Throughout the rest of the 1800s, Illinois lawmakers tried to enforce laws that restricted hunting, but the population didn’t seem to be recovering; Aldo Leopold of the Illinois Game Survey, an organization created in 1917, wrote in 1931 the last instance of deer in Northern Illinois occurred in 1874, although there were still deer kept in pens across the state..  The state purchased land around Horseshoe Lake in Alexander County in 1927 and used the property as a wildlife refuge, bringing deer in from other parts of the country then moving them to other states seeing the same need for a deer population..  Proper and well-enforced protection went a long way toward rehabilitating the deer population, and by 1940 the nearly non-existent deer population was up to 500 statewide..  Limited hunting was allowed again in 1957 after the deer population was properly recovered at a reported 3,100 known..  There were more than 10,000 hunting permits given out in 1957 with more than 1,735 deer killed, including a 200-pound buck killed with a bow and arrow by John Force of Chandlerville. The 1960s passed with a population of 25,000 deer before it exploded during the next 20 years, hitting 100,000 in 1990 and forcing the state to open up hunting seasons even further..  The state extended firearm season from six to seven days, added a three-day muzzleloader season in December and allowed for a three-day antlerless deer season in January of 1992..  In 1995, there were more than 100,000 deer killed, and that still wasn’t enough to stem the booming population. In 2005, 200,000 deer were harvested, but today the population sits at around 660,000 and fluctuates around there..  “[Population] increased from 1901 onward until it hit its high point in 2007 or 2008,” Skinner said. “We had a record harvest in 2005. It got to the point where people realized there were too many deer on the ground.”.  Skinner said there were complaints of damage and people were hitting deer with their car, so the Illinois General Assembly created a task force that recommended the use of deer vehicle accident rate to keep track of what hunting numbers should be, rather than just using the population..  The deer vehicle accident rate has gone down on average across the state, even though a few counties have seen it go higher..  Skinner said Chronic Wasting Disease is currently the biggest threat Illinois deer face as it makes its way across 17 counties in Northern and North Central Illinois, including La Salle County..  “It’s a 100% fatal neurological disease, and it’s unlike any other disease we’ve tried to manage because it’s caused by a misshapen protein called a prion,” Skinner said. “It can withstand high temperatures, low temperatures, UV lights and it can be transmitted from deer to deer or picked up from a contaminated environment.”.  Skinner said they’re expecting a population decline of around 10% because of the disease.","[0.5020117163658142, 0.4979882538318634]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5020117163658142

514,"Only Mississippi has gone worse than Illinois in personal income growth since the big recession hit at the end of 2007. State tax content analysis shows..  The recovery from the major downturn is uneven among US states, but Illinois has experienced particular difficulties, according to a recent analysis by the Pew Charitable Trust..  Illinois succeeded well in all states except in Mississippi in the growth of personal revenue. The average annual average annual compound compound growth rate of 2.1% since the recession was an average of 1.1% per annum..  A more in-depth look at the data shows that there is one common factor in personal income recovery which states income tax policy t.  On average, states with more competitive income tax policies, such as non-income tax states or states with low income taxes, have stronger personal income growth since the recession and the latest 12-month period. The slowest growth in personal income by states has rising income tax rates and also has higher income tax burdens on average. Four of the worst five states have progressive income taxes that are performing in terms of personal income growth..  Successful with those with flat income taxes better than their progressive income tax peers, but state performance has no income tax yet. Of the best performing states, 4 out of 5 have a fair income tax or no income tax, with the exception of North Dakota, which has benefited from a large boom of natural resources and imposes a marginal tax rate of 2.9%. The growth of North Dakota's personal income has benefited from the growth that occurred shortly before the recession, although growth in recent years has been driven by fluctuations in oil prices..  California, a state with one of the highest income taxes in the nation, is ranked 6th in terms of personal income growth from the start of the recession, benefiting from the annual population growth that exceeds the national median and is a characteristic. most of western states. While California's 10-year performance is stronger than all neighboring states, the reverse is true over the last year, with personal income growth declining in all neighboring states..  States with progressive income taxes have higher average income tax burdens and generally their peers are weak. This is not surprising, as the relationship between economic growth and income tax policy is well established. The higher tax has a negative impact on the economy, and progressive income taxes are more detrimental to the economy than equivalent equal income taxes..  While there are many policy factors that may be pushing state performance up or down, it is likely that all state economies would benefit from lower and more equitable income taxes. For example, a more friendly tax climate may have resulted in stronger personal income growth in California and prevented the state from neighbors falling in 2019..  The analysis from Pew shows some common themes. First, the Southern and Western region's regions generally have the strongest revenue growth, while the Midwest and Northeast states are weak during the recovery. Population growth is also in line with this trend..  In addition to North Dakota, Utah, Washington, Texas and Colorado are the best states in personal income growth. Each year has seen a much more consistent year of growth. These states have more rapid population growth than the rest of the country, a common sign of a healthy labor market and economic growth..  The United States made the worst is Mississippi, Illinois, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. These are among the states with the lowest population growth, and each year suffer population loss from each state since the recession. The population of Illinois and Connecticut has declined for six consecutive years, and the population of West Virginia has been declining for seven consecutive years..  Long-term economic growth is closely linked to population growth. Population growth is a growing workforce and consumer base that allows businesses to invest confidently, knowing that they will be able to find workers and consumers for their products. Similarly, workers find it easier to find employment and enjoy their income in growing and growing economies. Regardless of the factor causing the other, population growth is closely related to revenue growth and is a major concern for states such as Illinois..  Since Illinoisans are asked to approve a progressive income tax at the ballot on 3 November and politicians promise that it will be a magical pill for all state problems, it is important to keep this analysis in mind. Illinois is experiencing population loss, and declining states face more economic challenges..  The latest Pew report reiterates the difficulty of progressive income tax states in maintaining a healthier labor market relative to their peers. If Illinois adopts progressive income tax, it will not grow to the population of the state, its economy or its labor market.

515,"Illinois is an exporter of moving trucks, according to the companies that own them. In annual reports, Atlas Van Lines, United Van Lines, and U-Haul all have Illinois listed as a state with significantly more outbound moving trucks than inbound ones. Atlas said 61 percent of its moving trucks that crossed Illinois’ state lines were on their way out, making it the fourth-highest percentage of outbound moves in the nation. United Van Lines has released its National Movers Survey every year for decades. In 2019, Illinois saw the tail lights of more than 4,500 of United Van Lines' trucks and welcomed about 2,300. “For the last decade, Illinois has definitely teetered more outbound than inbound, but we’ve seen a significant rise lately,” said Eily Cummings, United Van Lines communications director. The Champaign-Urbana area, Cummings said, had one of the highest outbound ratios in America. “Decatur, Rockford, Joliet, and Champaign show a 70 percent or more,” she said. “In Champaign’s instance, it’s almost 80 percent outbound.” United Van Lines data showed many midwesterners were moving to states like Arizona, New Mexico and Florida, all common retirement destinations. Cummings said corporate relocations make up a significant portion of Illinois’ out of state moves. “Retirement is still the story, but you can’t really overlook some of those corporate relocations and manufacturing plant closures,” she said. Beyond neighboring Indiana, the top destination for Illinois ex-pats was Florida. According to a Wall St. Journal analysis of Census data, more than 500,000 Floridians said they were residents of a different state in 2018, more than any other state. Forty-one percent of United’s outbound Illinois movers said they left for a job compared to 30 percent who said they were retiring. The annual U-Haul “Top Growth States” report naturally trends toward more of a middle-class customer, according to U-Haul Illinois President Aaron Freeman, who said the majority of the company's moves are from one part of Illinois to another. “It’s more of a perception that everybody is fleeing the state,” he said. “I just don’t see it on the front line.” Illinois ranked last again in U-Haul’s 2019 comparison of states, meaning the state had far fewer inbound moves than it did people taking their trucks and crossing state lines with them. Illinois shrank by 51,000 in total population in 2019, according to the latest U.S. Census population estimates.","[0.6382538080215454, 0.3617461919784546]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6382538080215454
516,"New York, California and Illinois have been hemorrhaging residents. Almost 3.2 million more people left those states for elsewhere in the U.S. than arrived from other states, from 2010 through 2019, according to population estimates released last week by the Census Bureau. Nine other states saw net out-migration of more than 100,000 people over that period, but none really came close to the big three..  Thanks to 2 million more births than deaths and 1 million newcomers from other countries, California's population still grew by about 2 million over this period, a gain that trailed only those of Texas and Florida. New York's population grew but only slightly, while Illinois lost an estimated 159,751 people between 2010 and 2019. Yes, these are all big states, but New York and Illinois ranked second and third in net domestic migration as percentage of 2010 population, behind only Alaska (California ranked 13th)..   Where are all these people going? The Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative Albany think tank, put together some estimates for New York based on data that the Internal Revenue Service gleans from tax returns. (The Census Bureau also releases data on state-to-state migration flows, but those are based on surveys with sometimes-large margins of error, so the IRS numbers are more reliable if less complete.) This inspired me to do the same for California and Illinois..  Here are the Empire Center's numbers for New York: The adjusted gross income of New York taxpayers who didn't migrate averaged $88,940 from 2012 through 2018. Those who left for Florida, New Jersey, California and Connecticut made more money than that; those who moved to other states in the top 10 less, in some cases much less. By far the most affluent group of migrants from New York was the 1,309 taxpayers who moved to Wyoming, who had an average income of $179,014..  Here's where Californians have been heading: The adjusted gross income of California taxpayers who didn't migrate averaged $84,641, and migrants to all of the top-10 states made less than that. Also notable in California's case is that it experienced net inflows from about half the states, including New York and Illinois. It's losing residents in huge numbers to nearby states, but still attracting people from the Northeast and Midwest..  Here's where Illinoisans have been going: The adjusted gross income of Illinois taxpayers who didn't migrate averaged $78,959. Illinois has been losing high-income residents (a lot of them retirees, one imagines) to Florida, middle-income residents to the South and West, and those with lower incomes to neighboring states. Also, the top two destinations for Illinois migrants are the top two for the nation as a whole, with Florida first, Texas second..  by signing up you agree to our terms of service Domestic migration statistics are frequently cited as evidence of the failures of blue-state governance, in particular the higher taxes imposed by states that are losing lots of residents..  There's something to that -- income-tax-free Florida sure is attracting a lot of affluent people from Illinois and New York, and a recent study of high-income California taxpayers concluded that a 2012 income tax increase there did in fact drive some away..  But California, Illinois and New York have all experienced bigger per capita personal income gains than the nation as a whole since the beginning of 2010, and all saw taxpayers with incomes below $50,000 overrepresented among the leavers from 2011 through 2018..  These departures may indicate failures of governance as well, but it's a different set of governance failures, presumably related more to housing costs, commutes and job opportunities than taxes per se..   There also isn't much evidence in the IRS data -- yet -- of an exodus of high-income taxpayers hit by the state-and-local-tax-deduction limits imposed by the 2017 tax bill..  That is, the number of taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 or more leaving for other states actually fell in high-tax California, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey and New York from 2017 to 2018, the year the cap went into effect..  Those who ended up with higher tax bills due to the change generally didn't find out exactly how much higher until 2019, though, so it may just be too early to tell..  One last thing I checked was which counties in New York have been sending the most migrants to other states..  My fellow Bloomberg Opinion columnist Conor Sen argued this week that in congressional-redistricting terms the most important population shifts of recent years have been from rural areas to large metropolitan areas, not from state to state..  Indeed, thanks to babies and immigrants, New York City and most of its suburbs have gained population over the past decade as the rest of the state has shrunk..  That may be changing, though, as the city in particular has been seeing accelerating migration to other states..  Of those who left New York state from 2011 to 2012, 49.1% were from the city. From 2017 to 2018, 68.4% were. A lot of those people are just moving to New Jersey. But it's not a great sign..  • Justin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

Illinois has lost more population than any other state in the country and it was one of just four states to shrink since 2010. The other three states were West Virginia, Connecticut and Vermont. By comparison, states like Indiana added 200,000 to its population, while fast growing states like Tennessee and South Carolina added more than 400,000 each. Florida, Texas and California have added millions to their populations since 2010..  Illinois’ population loss across so many counties is a reflection of the state’s outlier status on many of the nation’s economic, demographic and financial metrics. Illinois has the nation’s most costly pension crisis , one of the highest tax burdens , falling real home prices and a general lack of economic opportunity. It’s also one of the most corrupt states in the country..  Cook County lost the most population of any county in Illinois over the 2010-2018 period. The county lost nearly 19,000 people. Winnebago was second with a loss of 11,000. St. Clair was third with a population drop of 9,300..  Macon, Peoria, Madison, Vermilion, LaSalle, Rock Island, and Kankakee counties rounded out the top ten biggest losers of population..  At the other end, only nine of the state’s 102 counties managed to gain population over the period. Kane County grew by 18,000, largely offsetting Cook County’s losses. Another collar county, Will, gained 13,500. Kendall County was next with an increase of 12,500..

Collectively, Illinois’ downstate counties have suffered the worst loss of population, by far.

Three (DuPage, Will and Kane) of the five collar counties gained population, leaving the collar counties as the only growth area in Illinois..  However, that increase was largely at the expense of Cook County. Previous migration data shows many new collar residents come from Cook County..  Cook County itself lost 19,000, or 0.4 percent, of its total population over the 2010-2018. That’s on top of the more than 200,000 people it lost in the decade prior to that..  A 0.4 percent loss may not sound like much, but compared to the nation’s largest counties, Cook County is an outlier. Wirepoints analyzed the population change for the nation’s 50 most populous counties and found that Cook was one of just seven counties to lose population since 2010..  Think whatever you want about Illinois politics, but it’s being categorically rejected year after year by far too many residents..

Macon, Peoria, Madison, Vermilion, LaSalle, Rock Island, and Kankakee counties rounded out the top ten biggest losers of population.

At the other end, only nine of the state’s 102 counties managed to gain population over the period. Kane County grew by 18,000, largely offsetting Cook County’s losses. Another collar county, Will, gained 13,500. Kendall County was next with an increase of 12,500..  The only other counties to show growth were DuPage, Champaign, McLean, Monroe, Grundy, Williamson – just nine counties in all..  Collectively, Illinois’ downstate counties have suffered the worst loss of population, by far. The whole region lost nearly 120,000 people between 2010 and 2018 – more than 2.5 percent of its total population..  Three (DuPage, Will and Kane) of the five collar counties gained population, leaving the collar counties as the only growth area in Illinois..  However, that increase was largely at the expense of Cook County. Previous migration data shows many new collar residents come from Cook County..  Cook County itself lost 19,000, or 0.4 percent, of its total population over the 2010-2018. That’s on top of the more than 200,000 people it lost in the decade prior to that..  A 0.4 percent loss may not sound like much, but compared to the nation’s largest counties, Cook County is an outlier. Wirepoints analyzed the population change for the nation’s 50 most populous counties and found that Cook was one of just seven counties to lose population since 2010..  Think whatever you want about Illinois politics, but it's being categorically rejected year after year by far too many residents..  Until the state’s policies are flipped on their head – until Illinoisans finally get the big pension and spending reforms the state desperately needs – expect many more to uproot their lives to find opportunities elsewhere.

523,"President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Tuesday, July 21. AP Photos Crime in Chicago is Donald Trump’s new border wall. Facts and truth didn’t matter a whit to Trump four years ago when he stoked fears about hordes of rapists and murderers pouring over the border from Mexico to destroy America. He thought “the wall” might help him win him an election — and it did. Fear sells. Now Trump is at it again, this time stoking fears about out-of-control crime by thugs and radicals in Chicago and other big cities. He’s throwing it out there and hoping it sticks, if just long enough to get him reelected on Nov. 3. Please, voters, don’t let him get away with this again. Fascism-lite Chicago’s got a serious violent crime problem, no doubt. But Trump’s not out to fix it anymore than he was out to fix our nation’s immigration system. He’s out to use it for pure political gain, hoping to scare you into voting for him and fascism-lite. Editorials Trump is not the first American president to prey on our fears to divide us, pitting small towns and the suburbs against big cities, but he might be the first to overtly reveal his entirely cynical intentions. President Richard Nixon loved to rail about “law and order,” going on about looters in the streets and “bums” on college campus. But leave it to Trump to pin it all on “radical left” Democrats and claim Joe Biden — Joe Biden! — would “let terrorists roam free.” “Look at what’s going on — all run by Democrats, all run by very liberal Democrats. All run, really, by radical left,” Trump said on Monday, describing Chicago and other big cities as out of control. “If Biden got in, that would be true for the country. The whole country would go to hell. And we’re not going to let it go to hell.” Federal agents coming to town? This week, the Trump administration proposed sending about 150 federal agents, dressed in camouflage and armed like soldiers in a war zone, to Chicago. Was their plan to throw people into unmarked vans, as they have done to protesters in Portland, Oregon, like the old East German secret police? The joke is that nobody — certainly not Trump — has a clue as to how a bunch of Homeland Security agents, who might not know Englewood from Edison Park, are supposed to stop an 18-year-old gangbanger from shooting up a porch full of people. The bigger joke is that Trump doesn’t care. So long as he succeeds in whipping up fears about urban crime. So long as he can shake up those suburban moms whose support he needs on Election Day. So long as he can make this ugly plot line stick. On Tuesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Gov. J.B. Pritzker and state Attorney General Kwame Raoul were trying to keep their focus on fighting crime, not playing politics. Lightfoot had spoken with John Lausch, the top federal prosecutor in Chicago, about crafting a reasonable plan to use federal resources to help our city. “What I understand at this point — and I caveat that — is that the Trump administration is not going to foolishly deploy unnamed agents to the streets of Chicago,” the mayor said. “As I understand it, what we will be getting are some additional resources in the FBI, the DEA and the ATF.” Looking for a new “wall” Trump is drowning in the polls, done in by his pathetic handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and three years of overwhelming meanness, deceit and incompetence. He’s looking for a fresh new “wall,” something on which he can hitch a last-minute ride to election victory, and he thinks this “law and order” thing might be it. He tried to politicize the pandemic, but reopening the economy led to a lot more people inconveniently dying. He tried to politicize religion by holding up a Bible outside a shuttered church, but Trump with a Bible just looked weird. He has tried to politicize race relations again and again, most recently by going to bat for the Confederate flag, tone deaf to the fact that even a majority of Southerners now think the flag is racist. And, of course, Trump keeps bashing immigrants, though that game’s running on fumes. On Tuesday, Trump ordered that undocumented immigrants not be counted in the U.S. Census, though the express purpose of the Census is to count every human being in the country. We doubt Trump can win on law and order, either. It’s not going to stick. On the most basic level, we dare to believe, enough Americans are finally just sick of this guy. In recent weeks, Trump has tweeted the words “LAW AND ORDER!” more than 20 times, but all he’s managed to do is drive down his poll numbers even more. A poll released Sunday by The Washington Post and ABC News shows Biden leading Trump by 15 percentage points. On the question of who can be trusted more when it comes to “crime and safety,” registered voters picked Biden by a nine-point margin, 50% to 41%.

525,"Food and Drinks Published 2 hours ago Popsicle vendor accused of cultural appropriation by Chicago community Latino social media users target vegan popsicle, ice cream company Peachy of hurting local ‘paleteros’ Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By Cortney Moore FOXBusiness close video Culture war has become a political game: J.C. Watts Black News Channel founder J.C. Watts says common sense has been abandoned when discussing race relations in the United States..  A vegan popsicle and ice cream vendor has been pressured to stop serving its products in a public park due to some in the community who feel the brand’s use of a pushcart should be considered cultural appropriation..  Continue Reading Below.  The company in question, Peachy , faced backlash from residents for its Saturday post on Facebook, which advertised the new cart would be present in Logan Square, according to local news outlet Block Club Chicago ..  “Today we officially launch Peachy Vegan Ice Cream ... and soon so be brick and mortar ice cream shop / cafe featuring quick vegan and vegetation focused food items in Logan Square,” the optimistic Facebook post read. “Today we’ll be in the park at the monument with this cart slangin’ Vegan Ice Cream Popsicles (today’s flavs are Peach and Strawberry)... non dairy, vegan, all organic ingredients ... locally made, small batch and home schooled. See you on the street!”.  Instead of receiving support for its new business initiative, Peachy’s post received more than 2,400 comments and 3,000 shares at the time of publication, largely from social media users who think the company’s cart is too similar to a “paletero” – the Spanish job title for a popsicle street vendor that is commonly used in Mexico and Central America..  Critics argued that Peachy’s choice to serve its products in Logan Square was equivalent to cultural appropriation, gentrification and hurt local paleteros who face obstacles already such as low wages and harassment from law enforcement over permits or citizenship status. The coronavirus pandemic has reportedly also strained conditions for these vendors of Latin American descent..  A COVID-19 Relief Fund dedicated to Chicago street vendors on GoFundMe was largely shared under the post. The initiative has raised more than $42,600 thus far..  FOX Business reached out to Peachy and its owner, John Lawrence Geary, for comment on the backlash but neither immediately responded at the time of publication..  However, the company has published a lengthy news update on its website Tuesday..  “I&apos;m surprised and saddened by all of the negativity that has developed over trying to sell ice cream from a push cart and start a small business, from a truly positive place in my heart. I had no intentions of offending, appropriating or insulting anyone, nor did i mean to take away from or encroach on existing paletas,” the statement reads. “I understand how treasured paletas are in the community as both real direct sources of income for individuals / families as well as a cherished cultural tradition. Push carts are part of many ethnic cultures all over the world. I am listening and hear the community feelings towards this … We will no longer be using the cart.”.  Additionally, the company wrote that its intentions were to provide “healthy, organic food accessible and affordable to everyone” and that “it&apos;s odd and terrible to read false reviews from people who&apos;ve never tried anything from peachy.”.  Cook County, Chicago&apos;s county, has a population of around 5.15 million, according to 2019 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau . Of that number, 25.6 percent are said to be Hispanic or Latino, which is 3.4 percent less than the city of Chicago..  The median household income in Chicago was $55,198 as of 2018, the government agency reports..

526,"Save.  When Michael Hatfield of Makanda received a packet of seeds he did not order, he remembered a post he had seen on social media about mysterious seeds being mailed to people across the country..  Hatfifeld and his wife, Jessica, operate and live on Flyway Family Farm, a small family farm that specializes in growing mushrooms..  “It was a small envelope in the mailbox. I had seen a post or two online,” Hatfield said..  The package read “Flower Stud Earrings.” When he opened the package, it contained a tiny little Ziploc-style bag filled with tiny black seeds. Hatfield said his package looked identical to one he saw with a story online. He said the seeds looked a lot like small flower seeds..  As a farmer and forester, Hatfield knows the damage invasive species can do to natural areas and farming operations..  “I put it in a metal bowl and torched the heck out of it. I wasn’t about to plant or throw out those seeds,” he said. “There was no way I was letting those survive.”.  According to Krista Lisser, spokesperson for Illinois Department of Agriculture, Hatfield is not the only Illinois resident to receive unsolicited seeds in the mail. The agency received more than 500 reports of similar packages on Thursday morning alone. Lisser said the reports came from across the entire state and were not centralized in one location..  Illinois Department of Agriculture released the following statement with guidelines for handling unsolicited seeds:.  “We are currently working with USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to address reports of unsolicited shipments of seeds from foreign countries. Anyone who receives unordered seeds in the mail should contact the Illinois Department of Agriculture by emailing the following information to : First and last name, phone number and the number of packages received. Do not open the package, plant the seeds, or throw them out. Please keep all seeds unopened and with their original packaging and labels, including mailing labels, until further instruction is provided.”.  University of Illinois Extension also sent a news release regarding unsolicited seed packets..  The release said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is investigating the situation and collecting seeds packets to test their contents..  It also said Illinois Extension horticulture experts advise it is not a good practice to plant seeds from unknown origins or of an unknown species..  “One of the major risks would be the introduction of a potential invasive plant species,” Illinois Extension forester Chris Evans said in the release. “Those seeds could also harbor pests or diseases that could impact native species, agricultural crops, or desirable ornamentals.”.  To complicate matters even more for Illinois residents, Illinois Extension sent out “Together We Bloom” packets of wildflower and forget-me-not seeds in late July to encourage residents to fill out their census forms..  “Illinois Extension’s packets of forget-me-nots are the variety myosotis sylvatica and will arrive in packets clearly labeled with the contents of the packet and the organization who sent them,” the press release read..

528,"Illinois horticulturists warn about mystery seed shipments Springfield, IL, USA / News/Talk 94.7 & 970 WMAY Jul 31, 2020 9:25 AM Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  (The Center Square) – As if 2020 couldn’t get any stranger, Illinois residents are receiving unsolicited packages containing seeds that appear to have been sent from China..  Some of the mystery seeds were shipped in white packages that are sometimes labeled “jewelry.”.  The Illinois Department of Agriculture is asking residents not to open the packages, not to plant the seeds, and not to throw them out. Further instruction will be provided in the future..  Richard Hentschel, a University of Illinois horticulturist in St. Charles, said he was alarmed when he heard stories of the seeds from across the country..  ""My immediate mantra in all of this is: 'Don’t open, don’t plant,'"" Hentschel said. ""It would be silly to get that stuff in the ground not knowing anything about it."".  The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investigating the mystery seed shipments along with the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection, other federal agencies, and State departments of agriculture..  ""At this time, we don’t have any evidence indicating this is something other than a 'brushing scam' where people receive unsolicited items from a seller who then posts false customer reviews to boost sales,"" the department said in a statement. ""USDA is currently collecting seed packages from recipients and will test their contents and determine if they contain anything that could be of concern to U.S. agriculture or the environment."".  Osama El-Lissy, with the Plant Protection program of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said investigators have so far identified 14 different types of seeds including mustard, cabbage, morning glory and some herbs, such as mint, sage and rosemary..  Ken Johnson, U of I Extension horticulturist in Jacksonville, said it would be dangerous to plant the seeds..  “We don’t know what they are, so there is a potential that the plants these seeds are coming from could be invasive,” he said..  Johnson said the timing is bad because the extension is currently sending out wildflower seeds to remind residents to fill out Census forms, but those packets will be clearly marked by the extension..

530,"Enough Illinois House Democrats stand with Mike Madigan — for now House Democrats make a “stability” argument. They say nobody demanding Madigan’s resignation has presented an alternative. Jul 31, 2020, 4:53pm CDT Share this story Illinois House Speaker Michael J. Madigan Justin L. Fowler/AP Photos The calls were mostly brief and to the point, recipients said. House Speaker Michael Madigan just wanted to know where his members stood last week after two of his members demanded that he step aside as House speaker and Democratic Party of Illinois chairman. Did they agree with their fellow Democratic state representatives Terra Costa Howard and Stephanie Kifowit, he asked, that he should resign? Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary. Enough said they did not agree that Madigan issued a statement hours later saying the feedback he received was positive and that he had “no plans to resign.” The House Black Caucus, for one, appears to be mostly sticking with Madigan. That’s really no surprise. He’s been loyal to African American members for years — killing or altering bills they opposed, protecting their districts even after Chicago lost almost 200,000 African-Americans in the last census, etc. But it goes deeper than that. Black legislators, like most Black people, all know someone who’s been falsely accused of a crime, be it family, friends or constituents. Most are strong backers of social justice reforms. Several told me it would be counter to what they stood for to turn on Madigan now. The same goes for many Latinx legislators. If those two caucuses ever turn on him, though, the party is over. And Madigan surely knows that. Most “regular” and Downstate Democrats also appear to still be with Madigan. He’s been good to them as well, and the next speaker might be far more liberal than they’d prefer. And then there’s organized labor, which has long supported Madigan, but then welded themselves to him during the Bruce Rauner years when the Republican governor was trying to kill them off. Labor is the largest source of campaign cash and precinct workers in the state. Cross the unions and you have few other places to turn to for help. Few Democrats will risk this. Many of the House Democrats I spoke with last week made a “stability” argument. They complained that the people demanding that Madigan resign haven’t presented an alternative to Madigan. Who, for instance, would handle the fundraising and the precinct work and everything else involved with winning elections this fall if Madigan suddenly departed? Who would lay the groundwork for the fall veto session? Creating a sudden void with no alternative just didn’t make sense to them at this moment, although that may very well change if any of his close associates are indicted, some admitted. Black Caucus members with whom I spoke almost uniformly pointed to their own internal confusion and stagnation since May when their caucus chair Kimberly Lightford abruptly resigned. They and other Democrats also talked about the brutal infighting within the Senate Democratic caucus after Senate President John Cullerton unexpectedly retired last year. A Madigan departure would be 10, 20 or 50 times worse than any of that, they said, and they’re probably right. In my conversations with Black Caucus members, I was told that they hadn’t received a single constituent phone call about Madigan since the ComEd deferred prosecution agreement was revealed. Their constituents, I was told, are totally focused on things like crime, unemployment benefits and navigating through everything else wrought by the pandemic. In other words, they’re preoccupied with life during particularly hard times and just don’t care about MJM. I’m not trying to defend or justify any of this, by the way. I despise treating politics like a one-dimensional cartoon. There’s more going on than may meet the eye with a cursory glance at the headlines. On the other side of the spectrum, first-term suburban women have their own issues to deal with. Many of their constituents are indeed making angry calls about Madigan. The speaker’s money and talent may not be enough to save some of them in the face of all this scandal with ComEd and maybe other companies which have more recently been subpoenaed. And as I’ve told you before, the system Madigan built works only as long as his members believe he can protect them from their opponents. Once that confidence is gone, he serves no purpose. More importantly, this situation is most definitely not why they signed up for a political run. A lot of these folks were activated after Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss. So, being connected in any way to an alleged bribery scheme likely makes their skin crawl. It appears that Madigan has bought himself some time, for now. But if more people are charged and the feds get even closer to him, that may not turn out to be enough. Rich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com .

531,"Subscribe to Coronavirus.  Black residents in Illinois are seeing significantly higher rates of confirmed cases and deaths from the coronavirus than white residents, according to a Chicago Reporter analysis of data provided by the Illinois Department of Public Health..  Outside Chicago, black Illinoisans are currently dying from COVID-19 at 3.4 times the rate of white residents. Black residents account for 42% of coronavirus related deaths statewide and nearly 30% of the 11,256 confirmed cases in Illinois so far, despite only accounting for about 14% of the state population, according to Census data ..  The disproportionate racial impact of COVID-19 cases and deaths is being felt most dramatically within Chicago, where officials on Monday released new demographic data on the spread of the disease in the city, which is considered a national hot spot for the coronavirus..  Black Chicagoans are currently dying at five times the rate of white Chicagoans, according to an analysis of data from the Chicago Department of Public Health..  The figures build on those found in a WBEZ analysis of Cook County Medical Examiner’s office data published over the weekend..  “This isn’t a problem that’s unique to Chicago. We’re seeing this manifest in large urban areas with large black populations all over the United States. Milwaukee, Cleveland, Detroit and other places are experiencing the same thing,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a press conference Monday. “The numbers are weighted more heavily on the South and the West sides and among our most economically vulnerable communities.”.  The official counts likely understate the actual spread of infection as the availability of testing to confirm cases remains limited across the state, meaning what is known about the demographic impact may be incomplete or skewed. Incomplete reporting is also a problem, as the field for race was left blank or information was missing in about a quarter of confirmed cases on both the city and state levels..  Latinx and Hispanic ethnicities are also believed to be underreported in COVID-19 cases, CDPH Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said Monday, often because busy health providers can be uncomfortable asking about a patient’s race, a common issue in medical data. Her department signed a public health order enhancing data-sharing requirements including complete demographic information on COVID-19 patients..  “It means that people need to ask also,” Arwady said. “We need Chicago’s providers to take the time to ask the question and to ensure that it’s entered.”.  City officials attribute the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on black Chicagoans to higher baseline rates of chronic underlying conditions as well as pre-existing racial disparities in health care access..  “By and large, this is not, I’m sorry to say, a surprising story,” Arwady said. “Fundamentally, the systemic and institutional racism that have driven these inequities over the years, we are now seeing play out in our COVID data.”.  The city is forming a Racial Equity Rapid Response Team in partnership with West Side United and a community awareness campaign with AARP to curb the disparate impact of the disease on the South and West sides. Lightfoot also tied her administration’s COVID-19 response to her anti-poverty agenda , as longtime issues of equity and opportunity are exacerbating outcomes and posing barriers to healthcare for poor Chicagoans..  “We do know that our populations of color need additional resources,” Dr. Oluwatoyin M. Adeyemi, infectious disease physician and former senior director of HIV services at Cook County Health said about the challenges communities of color face in being able to quarantine at the press conference. “Social distancing for a lot of people is a privilege,” she said, pointing to how communities of color are more likely to rely on public transportation, live in close quarters, and be unable to work from home..  IDPH began publishing statewide demographic data on COVID-19 cases and deaths last Friday, highlighting the racial disparities. “It’s hard to make up for decades, frankly, maybe centuries of inequality of application of health care to people,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at his press briefing Sunday, pointing to plans to reopen shuttered hospitals to serve as relief health care centers during the crisis, WTTW reported..  Some Democratic lawmakers are calling on the federal government to collect and release data on the race and ethnicity of those affected by the coronavirus nationwide..  “It is critical that the federal government make a concerted effort to account for existing racial disparities in health care access and how persistent inequities may exacerbate these disparities in the weeks and months to come as our nation responds to this global health pandemic,” five members of Congress, including Illinois Rep. Robin Kelly, along with Rep. Ayanna Pressley and former presidential candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Kamala Harris, wrote in a March 27 letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar..  “Without demographic data, policy makers and researchers will have no way to identify and address ongoing disparities and health inequities that risk accelerating the impact of the novel coronavirus and the respiratory disease it causes,” the letter said.

The order says it will “ensure that all Chicagoans have fair and equal access to benefits, opportunities, and services provided by the City,” including anything provided as disaster relief to help fight the CCP virus pandemic. “This order is more than just an official decree, it is a statement of our values as a city and as Americans,” Lightfoot said in a statement . CCP VIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE “Since COVID-19 first reached our city’s doorstep, we have been working around the clock to ensure all our residents are secure and supported, including our immigrant and refugee communities, who are among the most vulnerable to the impact of this pandemic.” “Here in Chicago, saying ‘we are all in this together’ means that during this crisis, no one gets left out and no one gets left behind,” she said. Illegal immigrants who have no legal status in the United States do not meet the criteria for state unemployment insurance or other economic assistance, or the stimulus checks the federal government is sending out to all registered tax-payers part of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill Congress passed in March.

According to the National Review, at least 280,000 illegal immigrants were working in Illinois in 2018 based on a WBEZ analysis of census data . They were mostly concentrated around the sanctuary city of Chicago. Under the new order, the illegal migrants will be able to receive benefits through Chicago’s Housing Assistance Grant program, which provides disaster relief aid for the housing costs faced by those impacted by the current CCP crisis. Students will also be offered online Enrichment Learning Resources through Chicago Public Schools, and small businesses will have access to the $100 million Chicago Small Business Resiliency Fund, which provides disaster relief cash flow to any entrepreneur, including immigrant business owners. Michael Rodriguez, who serves as alderman of the 22nd Ward in Chicago, said “these Chicagoans are vital community members who work in various industries and help our great city to thrive every day,” and are “family members, co-workers, neighbors, and friends.” Chicago and Illinois are currently under a statewide Stay at Home order that was issued on March 20 until at least April 30. The order mandates all residents to stay home, unless traveling for essential needs or business, and requires businesses not engaged in essential activities to cease all activities except for minimum basic operations. According to the latest figures published on the official City of Chicago website , 5,511 cases of CCP virus have been confirmed in Chicago as of April 7, and 13,549 in Illinois. The majority of the known cases in Chicago are in individuals aged between 50-59, while the majority of deaths have occurred in individuals aged 70 or over.

533,"Illinois ahead of other states in Census response Cole Lauterbach The Center Square Published 3:15 pm CDT, Tuesday, April 7, 2020.  SPRINGFIELD — Illinois is ahead of the national average in terms of responding to the U.S. Census, according to federal officials..  In total, 66.7 million residents have responded to the U.S. Census, the nation’s decennial headcount initiated by the Constitution. By March 30, just under 40 percent of Illinois households had responded to the U.S. Census. As of April 5, Illinois had surged to just under 50 percent, a lower rate than only seven other states..  “We are optimistic in Illinois that we will be getting an accurate count,” said Tim Olson, associate director for field operations for the U.S. Census..  The response rate is because of the availability of filling out the Census online..  “Every additional household that responds online or over the phone, or with a paper form is one less household that the Census Bureau needs to send someone to get the information,” he said..  Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Virginia have the highest response rates at just over 50 percent.

534,"Chicago Public Schools will distribute computers to the highest-need students, with priority given to eighth graders, juniors and seniors, who are all at critical moments in their educational careers. by Hannah Leone, Chicago Tribune / April 7, 2020.  (TNS) — Chicago Public Schools will distribute computers to the highest-need students, with priority given to eighth graders, juniors and seniors, who are all at critical moments in their educational careers..  Priority is also recommended for students in temporary living situations, students with special needs, English learners and those in Advanced Placement or dual credit courses that require e-learning, according to guidance given to principals late Thursday. Financial need is also a factor, but with three-quarters of CPS students coming from low-income households, principals are facing tough decisions..  “The unfortunate reality is that our resources remain limited and there remains an unacceptable digital divide in our city and nation,” Chief Schools Officer Bogdana Chkoumbova and Chief Information Officer Phillip DiBartolo said in a letter to principals. “Not all students in our district will get new devices, but our top priority is getting a device to every student who needs one.” RELATED Local Share of $150B Coronavirus Relief Fund State Share of $150B Coronavirus Relief Fund Illinois Officials Concerned Coronavirus Will Impact Census.  The district estimates 115,000 students need devices, and CPS doesn’t yet have enough. Some devices the district recently ordered aren’t expected to arrive until later this month. In the meantime, the district is counting on schools to distribute school-owned laptops, Chromebooks and iPads..  “We are working to distribute more than 100,000 devices and will continue to look for additional resources to narrow the remaining gap,” states the guidance to principals..  For Tracey Robinson, whose children don’t have laptops or tablets, it’s been a long time coming..  “I feel like it shouldn’t have to be an epidemic for our kids to get the tools that they should have already had,” she said..  The family is temporarily living with Robinson’s mother in Bronzeville, and one of her children has a special education 504 plan, she said. That makes the family a priority candidate for devices..  “I just know that kids, they go to school up north, they already had tablets and laptops they were taking home and using, and the kids on the South Side always get whatever’s left or nothing at all,” Robinson said..  CPS was already in the process of a “technology modernization plan” with the goal of each student eventually having a device at school. But currently, 145 CPS schools have one device per student and the average school has 10 devices for every 14 students, according to the district. “To ensure remote learning can begin promptly, schools are encouraged to launch their own device loan programs while waiting to receive equipment from the district,” CPS guidance states..  Principals, assistant principals and counselors should by now have access to rosters with “priority factors” noted for each student, according to CPS. But principals will make final decisions about distribution at their schools..  Remote learning days officially start April 13. That week, printed materials and storage bags will be shipped to schools “to enable the assembly of device packets,” according to the guidance. If a school has devices and decides to distribute them before that, the school’s staff will be responsible for printing materials in each language needed..  Each school needs to figure out its own pickup plan and coordinate with families, with parents or guardians required to accompany students younger than 18 and sign agreements. Parents must show proof of identity, such as a government ID or utility bill, so the district can make sure they’re not giving devices to “unauthorized people.”.  The suggested distribution timeline allows two to three days for preparation to remove devices from classrooms to a staging area, and another two to three days for distribution, in which five to 10 devices at a time are moved from the staging area to the pickup area, where parents can check them out. An example provided to principals shows distribution setups for both drive-thru and walk-up plans, with suggestions for spacing out lines to promote social distancing. The Chicago Department of Public Health is not recommending gloves or masks for people who are well, but families will be encouraged to use hand sanitizer before signing in, according to CPS..  Though schools must record device assignments, they won’t be responsible for any damaged or lost during the remote learning period. And while parents and students are asked to prevent damage to devices they check out, parents won’t be charged for any damage, CPS said..  The district is recommending schools have security officers around for distribution, stating the sites may be targets of theft. With sufficient notice, the district said it can also arrange for a Chicago police presence if a school asks for it..  ©2020 the Chicago Tribune. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

535,"Chicago Tribune | Apr 08, 2020 | 10:18 AM Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn is pictured on May 21, 2019. The hospital declined to provide any information about current ICU bed capacity.(Jose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune) Chicago’s north and southwest suburbs have the lowest percentages of available intensive care unit beds in Illinois, according to data released by the governor’s office Tuesday..  In the north suburbs, 16.7% of 150 total ICU beds were reported to be available Tuesday; in the southwest suburbs, 20.7% of 372 total ICU beds were available. Advertisement.  Those were the lowest percentages of 11 regions across the state. The city of Chicago had 24.7% of its 774 ICU beds available — the third lowest percentage..  The Marion area in southern Illinois had the highest percentage of available ICU beds, at 75.9%. Among suburban Chicago regions, the northwest suburbs had the highest percentage of available beds at 50.8% of 250 beds..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, cautioned that no one, in any part of the state, should feel complacent..  “For those of you who didn’t hear your region listed as one operating with a lower percentage of available beds, that is not a sign that COVID-19 isn’t a problem in your community — far from it,” Pritzker said at a news conference Tuesday..  He noted that it wasn’t too long ago that only one county had confirmed cases of COVID-19. Now, 77 Illinois counties have confirmed cases, up from 54 counties a week ago..  “We have to be operating as if COVID-19 is circulating not just in every county but in every community,” Pritzker said. “We need to maintain our course, and we need to keep working to flatten the curve.”.  The figures on available ICU beds, by region, that were released Tuesday reflect only available ICU beds, not additional ones that hospitals may set up in coming weeks. A number of local hospitals have said they have plans in place to add more ICU beds as needed..  For example, Glenbrook Hospital in Glenview had 28 intensive care patients as of Monday, exceeding the hospital’s typical 21 intensive care beds. But the hospital has already added beds and could triple its normal number of intensive care beds in coming weeks and months if needed, according to hospital President Jesse Peterson Hall. Advertisement.  Glenbrook was recently converted to a COVID-19-focused facility, meaning that its emergency room is still open but it is admitting only patients with COVID-19 or suspected cases. In Evergreen Park, OSF Little Company of Mary Medical Center has already expanded its intensive care capacity from 17 to 26 beds but is looking to add another six beds, said President John Hanlon..  As of Tuesday morning, the hospital had a total of 66 COVID-19 patients and another 70 suspected cases awaiting test results, he said. The numbers accounted for 73 percent of the hospital’s total census..  The ICU has had its own surge over the last week. “Last Tuesday was a big day for us — we had to intubate nine patients overnight,” Hanlon said. “We went from 16 to 25 intubated on a single day.”.  Little Company sits in a bit of a “hospital desert,” he said. Advocate Christ Medical Center is a couple of miles away along 95th Street in Oak Lawn, but the two hospitals serve a mammoth swath of the city’s South Side and southwest suburbs..  Little Company serves many low-income people with underlying conditions of asthma, hypertension, chronic kidney disease or diabetes, all conditions that increase the risk of dying from COVID-19, Hanlon said. However, he noted that the hospital also diagnosed and sent home more than 100 patients with the disease. Advertisement.  “There are patients being sent home and doing OK,” he said. “While this is a bad disease, the vast majority of our patients do OK.”.  Advocate Christ Medical Center spokeswoman Johnna Kelly declined Tuesday to provide any information about capacity at the Oak Lawn hospital, which is among the largest in the state..  Silver Cross Hospital in New Lenox is seeing about 100 COVID-19-related patients a day, including those in intensive care, Dr. Amar Garapati, medical director of the intensive care unit, said in a video posted to the hospital’s Facebook page Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the hospital said she didn’t have numbers on how close Silver Cross is to reaching ICU capacity.

About 57% of the state’s 2,791 ventilators were still available as of Monday, according to the latest data from the Illinois Department of Public Health. Pritzker thanked California on Tuesday for lending Illinois 100 additional ventilators. Illinois has also received 450 ventilators from the federal government..

537,"Illinois political leaders should be commended for their rapid, bipartisan effort to mobilize against a once-in-a-century virus. While we don’t know when the pandemic will end, we do know what comes next: Illinois’ grinding fiscal crisis will become catastrophic. Once the virus is under control, political leaders must turn their focus to a single mission: cutting Illinois’ $430 billion in government retirement liabilities and tens of billions in state and local bonded debt..  “When the tide goes out, you find out who has been swimming naked” is Warren Buffett’s explanation for how recessions reveal a company’s financial wherewithal. The same is true for cities and states. Illinois was already caught swimming naked when the tide went out during the 2007-2009 recession. The sharp contraction revealed an over-leveraged state with tremendous debts. A lost decade followed..  Since the recession, tax hikes have sapped private sector investment and consumption while core government functions have been crowded out by pensions. Staggering liabilities have kept investors at bay. The Land of Lincoln led all states in population loss from 2010-2020 as Illinois’ economic performance diverged from the region and country..  Illinois’ 10-year GDP growth is worst in the Great Lakes region and 40% below national growth. Income growth is worst in the region and 20% below national growth. And jobs growth is worst in the region and 44% below national growth. Large coastal and southern states have trounced Illinois’ growth. Chicago has likewise been outpaced by big city peers..  Illinois’ facade of economic strength is a falling unemployment rate. But it is falling for all the wrong reasons. In the 13 months from Gov. JB Pritzker’s inauguration until the dawn of the pandemic recession, Illinois lost 4,400 private sector jobs on net, driven by the loss of 14,400 manufacturing jobs. The state’s unemployment rate fell from 4.4% to 3.4% because 65,000 jobless Illinoisans dropped out of the workforce..  Now the recession begins..  The rising national tide that floated an over-leveraged Illinois is gone. Preliminary federal jobs estimates for March showed 701,000 jobs lost. Coming months look bleak..  After our national tragedy ends, well-managed states will bounce back and steam forward. But Illinois will not share in the recovery. Its debts are an anchor that will hold back the economy. Government budgets will be in shambles..  Despite what progressive income tax advocates tell you, Illinois cannot tax or grow its way out of its debt crisis. An exodus of taxpayers is already well underway, in part due to high current and future taxes. The next decade is looking like the last one, the lost one. Tax hikes will deepen Illinois’ debt addiction and weaken its economy without fixing the problem..  As for a federal bailout, imagine the futility of Illinois going to fiscally responsible states, from which Congress gets the majority of U.S. senators, and asking them to pay off Illinois’ debts. Prudent neighbors such as Indiana saved for a rainy day, but they didn’t save enough to pay for Illinois..  Illinois will revive when its economy is unshackled from public debts. Current taxes are high enough to sap economic vigor, but not high enough for Illinois or Chicago to make actuarially required pension payments. When investors see Illinois’ liabilities, capital flows elsewhere. Illinois must course correct or face another lost decade..  There is an army of investors armed with capital ready to pour into Illinois. And the federal government might help if Illinois cuts its debt and gets its fiscal house in order. In the meantime, investment dollars will flow into the growth of better managed states, and Illinois residents will follow..

Illinois and New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority have been marketing about $3 billion of bonds in recent days -- the state to help plug budget holes and the authority to repay debt that is coming due.

The MTA found buyers for more than $1 billion of bonds on Tuesday, people familiar with the matter said, paying an unusually high interest rate to attract the investor interest. Still, the transaction proved the state-owned operator of New York City subway trains could refinance its obligations in public markets despite a 93% decline in ridership..  The authority delayed the deal in March when municipal bond markets shut down as Covid-19 spread, then again last week after the State of New York announced it would cut aid for the transit system. The authority agreed to pay a yield of 5.25% on some of the new bonds, compared with the roughly 2% investors demanded to own comparable debt in March, according to data from Electronic Municipal Market Access..

While that future remains elusive, the need for strong communities, good schools, safe roads, and fair representation will remain the same. The results of Census 2020 will indeed shape our future. Think of your community: Census results help determine how money is allocated to prevent child abuse and to provide housing assistance for older adults, to show where schools, clinics, food assistance, and community mental health services are needed, to fund libraries. Business owners will use 2020 Census data to make critical decisions. Think of your local schools: Census results help determine how money is allocated for the Head Start program, school lunches, grants that support teachers, and for special education. Think of your morning commute: Census results influence highway planning and construction, as well as grants for buses, subways, and other public transit systems. Think of your government: The results of this once-a-decade count determine the number of seats each state has in the House of Representatives and is used to draw congressional and state legislative districts.

542,"Danville has largest net population outflow among Illinois cities Springfield, IL, USA / News/Talk 94.7 & 970 WMAY June 06, 2020 09:17 am AP Photo/Seth Perlman.  (The Center Square) – Danville experienced the highest net migration decline – 6.7 percent – among the metro areas in Illinois between 2010 and 2018, according to an analysis by 24/7 Wall St..  Over that time period, the city recorded a 5.9 percent drop in its overall population, the study found. In its analysis, 24/7 Wall St. examined Census Bureau data to identify those cities that many Americans were abandoning..  Net migration reflects the difference between the numbers of people from other regions moving into the city and city residents moving elsewhere. Overall population changes within the city, however, also include births and deaths, according to the study..  The population of Danville in 2018 was 76,806, while the metro area’s January 2020 jobless rate was 4.9 percent, 24/7 Wall St. reported..  Among the 50 states, 10 contained no metro areas with net migration declines over the eight-year period. They are Delaware, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota and Wyoming..  ---.  Cities With Greatest Net Migration Declines by State.

543,"https://ift.tt/376RUxP.  The Summer Food Service Program will provide healthy meals and snacks to residents age 18 and younger at hundreds of sites across Illinois this summer. Families can find the nearest summer meals site by calling (800) 359-2163, texting “FoodIL"" to 877-877, or visiting summermealsillinois.org ..  Hunger touches every community in Illinois. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic means even more families depend on federally funded nutrition programs. Illinois’ summer meals programs rely on community organizations, school districts, and other sponsors dedicated to ending childhood hunger in Illinois. ISBE is continuing to encourage organizations to take part in this program to ensure all students have access to meals when school is not in session. Interested organizations can learn more about becoming a sponsor or site at www.isbe.net/summerfood ..  ISBE is utilizing waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to allow meals to be served in safe, socially distanced ways, such as curbside pickup, home delivery, and provision of meals for multiple days of the week at one time. Waivers will also allow parents and/or guardians to pick up meals and bring them home to their children..  “COVID-19 has turned many families’ lives upside down. Illinois’ summer meals programs help to ensure that one thing families do not have to worry about is where their children will get their next meal,” State Superintendent of Education Dr. Carmen I. Ayala said. “Throughout this crisis, schools have found safe and creative ways to meet students’ nutritional needs, such as home delivery, pickup, and drive-through options. Thanks to federal waivers that we have secured, these options will continue over the summer. We encourage all school districts to evaluate the needs of their communities during this trying time and to participate in summer food programs, if possible.”.  Requirements.  All participating sponsors must provide free meals to all sites that meet income eligibility. Income eligibility can be determined through school attendance area data, census data, or household eligibility data..  Open and restricted open sites serve areas in which poor economic conditions exist and must provide meals to all children without charge. The meals must be the same for all children regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability. Sites will provide meals on a first-come, first-served basis..  Enrolled sites and camps must provide meals to all eligible children free of charge given certain criteria. Enrolled sites are sites open only to children enrolled in a program or to a group of identified children, as opposed to the community at large. Enrolled sites are able to qualify by either area eligibility or individual income eligibility of the children attending the site. Children at residential and non-residential camps who wish to participate in SFSP may qualify for free meals by meeting the income guidelines for reduced-price meals in the National School Lunch Program. The income guidelines for reduced-price meals by family size are listed below. A foster child and children who are part of households that receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps) benefits or benefits under Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) are automatically eligible to receive free meals at eligible program sites. Acceptance and participation requirements for the program and all activities are the same for all regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability..  There will be no discrimination in the course of the meal service at any sites..  Income guidelines.  If a household’s income falls within or below the guidelines listed below, a family member should contact the site’s sponsor to learn the benefits of the program. If the site does not meet area eligibility, families may be required to complete an application and provide income, TANF, or SNAP information. Contact ISBE at (800) 545-7892 or at cnp@isbe.net for possible alternative methods to meet site eligibility..  To file a program complaint of discrimination, complete the USDA Program Discrimination Complaint Form (AD-3027) found at www.ascr.usda.gov/complaint_filing_cust.html and at any USDA office or write a letter addressed to USDA and provide in the letter all of the information requested in the form.

The January 29, 2020 Chicago Magazine article by Edward McClelland used the 2010 Decennial Census data, and 2013 – 2017 ACS Census data, to conclude the following. “According to the same data, Illinois saw a decline in households earning less than $100,000 a year, while those earning more than $200,000 increased by 50 percent.” That was the basis for the article’s headline, “Illinois Is Not Losing Its Highly Taxed Residents.” That statistic is looking at the number of such households, and not their cumulative income.

I don’t see it s an omission that I didn’t say that. The problem is that McClelland used that to claim the rich aren’t leaving, which is an entirely different topic.

Basically there are 4 movements in and out of the category of households earning $200K+ in AGI. 1. Households moving into the state earning $200K+. 2. Households moving out of the state earning $200K+. 3. Households remaining the state, income increasing to $200K. 4. Households remaining in the state, income decreasing to less than $200K.

Keep in mind the state has to spend more to retain those on the lowest end of the AGI scale. We hear this a lot…if only Illinois “invested” more in social services/job opportunities/education/whatever, those people wouldn’t leave. Unfortunately, we already invest heavily in all these services. Financially-speaking, these people are cost centers. llinois doesn’t have to spend much to retain someone making over $200K, or, for that matter, $100K.

I think most who ponder this topic would agree that the poor require more per capita of governmental services than to the middle and upper income people. So, the poor are considers “takers” of the government’s revenue streams more so that the other segments. If taxes at all levels in Illinois rise as most expect, the common notion is that that the richer segments will move to more tax-friendly states–something that needs to be discouraged.

They believe that wealth is a zero-sum game, in which all markets are simply a fight for everyone to get their piece of a fixed pie.

This year, households across the country by March 12 will be able to fill out the form by mail, phone or internet ..

552,"Why is Illinois construction so weak? As it turns out, big government programs can’t paper over weak fundamentals..  Ten years ago, the nation bottomed out..  The second quarter of 2009 was the lowest point of the Great Recession, the ashes from which the U.S. economy would rise. New data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis released in November show how far each state has come in the decade since..  And how far Illinois still has left to go..  Bottom line: Illinois’ recovery has significantly lagged the regional and national growth stories. Over the past decade, Illinois’ economy has expanded by 14.7% in real terms. The rest of the Great Lakes region, which includes Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin, has grown 21.9%. The rest of the U.S. saw 25.7% growth..  These abstract figures represent very real lack of opportunity for Illinois families, businesses and even governments. They show the grass is growing greener elsewhere..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office has touted raising the minimum wage and signing a capital bill as evidence of their work to improve the state economy..  “Since taking office, Governor Pritzker has been strengthening the foundation for continued, long-term job growth across the state,” said economic development official Erin Guthrie following the November jobs numbers release..  But Illinois history runs counter to the governor’s narrative..  In 2009, then-Gov. Pat Quinn signed a $31 billion capital bill to stimulate construction spending . Despite that massive influx of cash, Illinois’ construction industry continued to decline for more than three years. Construction output in Illinois today is 2.1% below what it was in 2009..  By comparison, U.S. construction output is up by 13.5%; Wisconsin is up 7.7%; Indiana is up 9.4%; Ohio is up 20.8%; and Michigan is up by 33.6%..  This calls into question the potential boost from Pritzker’s capital bill, which is already shrouded in controversy. Two of its key backers in the General Assembly, Chicago Democratic state Sen. Martin Sandoval and state Rep. Luis Arroyo, have announced their resignations in the wake of a federal corruption probe..  Why is Illinois construction so weak? As it turns out, big government programs can’t paper over weak fundamentals..  New housing helps form the backbone of the construction sector. But high property taxes, policy uncertainty and population loss are cracking vertebrae..  In 2018, Illinois saw 10,000 permits issued for new single-family homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The state averaged around 40,000 permits a year prior to the Great Recession. That 75% plunge is the worst decline of any state in the nation. Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Missouri have all seen more single-family home construction than Illinois for three years running..  Even when including permits for new multi-unit housing, Illinois’ drop is still the worst in the nation, declining to 21,500 units in 2018 from a yearly average of 58,100 prior to the recession. In 2018, Indiana saw nearly 21,500 new units with a population half as large. Colorado saw 42,600..  Monthly permit numbers released so far suggest 2019 will be similarly slow for Illinois..  Ultimately, the construction sector is downstream from the state economy overall. Getting Illinois on a path to healthy growth requires a competitive business climate, reasonable tax burden and effective government services..  But standing in the way of all three is the worst state and local pension problem in U.S. history. It is the cause of endless property tax hikes, hollowed-out government services and pressure for higher taxes at the state level. Pritzker’s progressive income tax proposal, for example, would raise Illinois’ corporate income tax to among the highest in the nation..  The path toward better growth is not paved with flashy new government programs. It is paved with the discipline and honesty to get the basics right..  Illinoisans are waiting, Springfield. Want more?

Bottom line: Illinois’ recovery has significantly lagged the regional and national growth stories. Over the past decade, Illinois’ economy has expanded by 14.7% in real terms. The rest of the Great Lakes region, which includes Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin, has grown 21.9%. The rest of the U.S. saw 25.7% growth..  These abstract figures represent very real lack of opportunity for Illinois families, businesses and even governments. They show the grass is growing greener elsewhere..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office has touted raising the minimum wage and signing a capital bill as evidence of their work to improve the state economy..  “Since taking office, Governor Pritzker has been strengthening the foundation for continued, long-term job growth across the state,” said economic development official Erin Guthrie following the November jobs numbers release..  But Illinois history runs counter to the governor’s narrative..  In 2009, then-Gov. Pat Quinn signed a $31 billion capital bill to stimulate construction spending . Despite that massive influx of cash, Illinois’ construction industry continued to decline for more than three years. Construction output in Illinois today is 2.1% below what it was in 2009..  By comparison, U.S. construction output is up by 13.5%; Wisconsin is up 7.7%; Indiana is up 9.4%; Ohio is up 20.8%; and Michigan is up by 33.6%..  This calls into question the potential boost from Pritzker’s capital bill, which is already shrouded in controversy. Two of its key backers in the General Assembly, Chicago Democratic state Sen. Martin Sandoval and state Rep. Luis Arroyo, have announced their resignations in the wake of a federal corruption probe..  Why is Illinois construction so weak? As it turns out, big government programs can’t paper over weak fundamentals..  New housing helps form the backbone of the construction sector. But high property taxes, policy uncertainty and population loss are cracking vertebrae..  In 2018, Illinois saw 10,000 permits issued for new single-family homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The state averaged around 40,000 permits a year prior to the Great Recession. That 75% plunge is the worst decline of any state in the nation. Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Missouri have all seen more single-family home construction than Illinois for three years running..  Even when including permits for new multi-unit housing, Illinois’ drop is still the worst in the nation, declining to 21,500 units in 2018 from a yearly average of 58,100 prior to the recession. In 2018, Indiana saw nearly 21,500 new units with a population half as large. Colorado saw 42,600..  Monthly permit numbers released so far suggest 2019 will be similarly slow for Illinois..  Ultimately, the construction sector is downstream from the state economy overall. Getting Illinois on a path to healthy growth requires a competitive business climate, reasonable tax burden and effective government services..  But standing in the way of all three is the worst state and local pension problem in U.S. history. It is the cause of endless property tax hikes, hollowed-out government services and pressure for higher taxes at the state level. Pritzker’s progressive income tax proposal, for example, would raise Illinois’ corporate income tax to among the highest in the nation..  The path toward better growth is not paved with flashy new government programs. It is paved with the discipline and honesty to get the basics right..  Illinoisans are waiting, Springfield. Want more?

554,"Cook County government will give out $20 million in federal CARES Act funds to suburban residents struggling to pay rent during the coronavirus pandemic, officials announced Friday while emphasizing the need for a slow-moving Congress to advance a second stimulus package..  Households earning under 80% of the area median income — under about $72,000 for a family of four — can apply for grants that will cover overdue or future rent, Rich Monocchio, executive director of the Housing Authority of Cook County, said at a news conference in Oak Park. Up to $4,500 is available per household to pay between one to three months of rent..  “When this pandemic ravaged Cook County and so many working families experienced hardship, we knew that we had to do more,” Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said. “The need remains critical and urgent.”.  Suburban residents can apply at www.cookcountyil.gov/recovery from Aug. 10 to 18..  Because officials anticipate the demand will exceed their available funds, applicants will be randomly chosen before awards go out to landlords, Monocchio said..  One-quarter of the $20 million will go to places bearing the brunt of the economic devastation from the coronavirus pandemic. Monocchio estimates the maximum number of households benefiting from the program will be about 7,000..  “It only stands to reason that during a period like this, the county would have a program that helps the most vulnerable renters stay in their homes and weather out this pandemic,” Monocchio said..  The program is only available to suburban Cook County residents. Last week, Chicago launched its own series of housing grants totaling $33 million. Chicago residents can apply for mortgage and rental assistance funded by the federal coronavirus relief bill at chi.gov/housinghelp , Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced. Statewide, another $300 million from the aid package will be doled out through two Illinois Housing Development Authority programs for rent and mortgage help. Story continues.  Experts fear that for tenants suffering the most during the pandemic’s economic downturn, the looming expiration on Illinois’ eviction moratorium as well last month’s end of extra unemployment benefits under the CARES Act could spur a groundswell of evictions across the state. In July, Gov. J.B. Pritzker postponed the moratorium deadline through Aug. 22, and this week the state announced a 20-week extension of additional jobless benefits..  During the news conference, Preckwinkle expressed impatience over Congress’ drawn-out talks over the second federal stimulus package, which she has long stressed is crucial for Cook County..  “Congress seems nowhere near ready to approve continued unemployment benefits,” Preckwinkle said. “This is critical for so many folks who’ve lost their jobs.”.  “The Cook County program and the other programs are going to help a significant number of people,” Bob Palmer, policy director at Housing Action Illinois, said. “But they won’t come anywhere close to meeting the overall needs for people who are having a hard time affording housing, which is a long-term problem but it’s particularly bad now because of COVID-19.”.  In July, 27.9% of Illinoisans missed last month’s rent or mortgage payment or did not think they could make next month’s housing payment on time, according to a U.S. Census Bureau survey. A report released by the Aspen Institute on Friday estimates 30 million to 40 million Americans could risk eviction in the next several months..  “The freezes are going to lift, and when that happens, we are going to see a serious wave of evictions if there isn’t any policy response,” said Michelle Layser, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law. “It’s a big problem. There’s been a real failure at the federal level.”.  Xochitl Flores, Cook County bureau chief of economic development, said the rental assistance program, run by the Bureau of Economic Development and HACC, also would mobilize outreach to communities of color, families with children, veterans and disabled residents. In addition, programs for mortgage assistance and eviction prevention will be rolled out in the coming weeks..  “As the spring and the summer rode on, it became clear that the greatest challenge facing our communities, would be for residents to stay safely within their homes,” Flores said. “Our goal is to help those who are the most vulnerable and most impacted by COVID.”.  ———","[0.5004096031188965, 0.4995903968811035]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5004096031188965
555,"CHICAGO – An Illinois officer who had been placed on leave after shooting two people in a car Tuesday night , fatally injuring one, has been fired by the Waukegan Police Department. The officer, who was not identified, was a five-year member of the department and is Hispanic. He was terminated Friday night ""for multiple policy and procedure violations,"" Department Commander Edgar Navarro said in a press release. Marcellis Stinnette, 19, was killed , and his girlfriend, Tafara Williams, 20, was injured after the officer shot into a car that allegedly reversed toward him. On Friday, attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio M. Romanucci – who represent the families of George Floyd , Daniel Prude , Byron Williams and others – said that they had been retained to represent Williams. Williams has serious injuries but is expected to recover. ""Ms. Williams’ legal team will begin our own investigation into what happened during that incident, because we do not trust the police narrative in this case. We have seen over and over that the 'official' report when police kill Black people is far too often missing or misrepresenting details,"" Crump said in a press release. ""We will share our findings with the public when we have uncovered the truth."" You know George Floyd and Breonna Taylor's stories: 10 years after his death, you should also know DJ Henry's. The incident happened just before midnight Tuesday, when an officer approached a ""suspicious"" vehicle, Navarro told reporters Wednesday. As the officer was conducting his investigation, the vehicle fled and was spotted moments later by another officer, who got out of his car to approach the vehicle, Navarro said. ""That officer exited his vehicle, and the vehicle that he was investigating began to reverse towards the officer. The officer then pulled out his duty weapon and fired into the vehicle,"" Navarro said. The initial police report said the officer was ""in fear for his safety."" He struck both Stinnette, who was in the passenger seat, and Williams, who was in the driver's seat. They both were taken to the hospital, where Stinnette died. No firearms were found in the vehicle, Navarro said. He did not elaborate on why the vehicle was initially stopped. Navarro said Wednesday that both officers involved had been placed on leave. Neither have been identified. The families of Stinnette and Williams, who are Black, have questioned the department's official narrative. Cliftina Johnson, Williams' mom, said she visited her daughter in the hospital, where she is in serious condition. Her daughter is a mother of two. Illinois State Police's Public Integrity Task Force was investigating the incident, and the Waukegan Police Department had turned over all reports, body cam and dashcam videos, Navarro said. Lake County State's Attorney Michael Nerheim said Wednesday he would review the state police investigation and make the ""entire case file"" available to the public once complete. Dozens of men, women and children marched through Waukegan on Thursday afternoon to demand justice for Williams and Stinnette, walking with fists raised and chanting ""Black lives matter."" ""Say his name! Marcellis Stinnette! What's her name? Tafara Williams,"" the group chanted, according to livestreams of the march posted to social media. With a population of more than 86,000, Waukegan is majority Hispanic or Latino and about a quarter non-Hispanic white and a quarter Black, according to the Census Bureau. The city is about 15 miles south of Kenosha, Wisconsin, where Jacob Blake, 29, was shot in the back multiple times as he was getting into a car, triggering unrest in the city and sparking protests around the nation. Of the more than 5,700 people police have shot since 2015, 24% were Black, even though Black Americans make up 13% of the U.S. population, according to a Washington Post database of fatal shootings by on-duty police officers.

556,"Galba Otho Vitelius said:  Detroit only got to a population of two million because of the auto boom (also World War 2 industries). Detroit in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s was a one-off bubble city (I would argue the same for early 21st century Phoenix) and there is no way that could last. On top of that, you the drive by US industrialists to constantly find lower labor costs, either from continually importing workers from poorer areas (Eastern Europe and the American South, both black and white, the latter creating massive race relations problems which plagued all Midwestern cities), then by moving industries out of the Midwest altogether. Getting post-World War 2 populations and prosperity to last into the 21st century in the Midwest is impossible. Toronto got the Canadian financial sector from Montreal, when the French speaking population of Montreal started to take back the city. Chicago and Pittsburgh are in really good locations, particularly Chicago is an an ideal position for transportation networks, and Chicago has some finance. Both Chicago and Pittsburgh have shrunk significantly in population. Detroit's geographical position is more analogous to that of Buffalo or Milwaukee. The best case scenario, a smaller but more functional city, is actually what Detroit will probably wind up with in ten years anyway. Click to expand... I think you're being unnecessarily pessimistic about a realistic ATL Detroit, given than the metro Detroit area has had almost comically bad and divisive politics for decades now. Detroit had its population above 1 million by 1920 until 1990, so I think it's fair to say that a Detroit with competent leadership would have at worst a population of 1 million. I also don't understand what you mean by Detroit's geographical position being analogous to Buffalo or Milwaukee. Detroit has the busiest international border crossing in North America and is at a natural chokepoint for trade and transit between America and Canada. Galba Otho Vitelius said:  What would be realistic for Detroit would be a decision,made by either the pols or the auto executives, that auto companies employ a lot of engineers and maybe the should be trained in Michigan. So you get a Carnegie-Mellon quality school in Michigan, it could be attached to the University of Michigan, or Ford starts a private university in Detroit. Ideally this attracts non-auto companies to the area. But note this is not a panacea. Pittsburgh has the actual Carnegie-Mellon. Chicago has Northwestern and the University of Chicago. Even Michigan has the University of Michigan. Chicago and Pittsburgh still have declined in population, they have just done better compared to other Midwestern cities. Metro area government is always a good idea, but also always the type of thing forced on the local powerbrokers and population by the state (or provincial, as in the case of Toronto) whenever it happens. Mass transit is a good idea, but always something, as the example of Atlanta shows, is something that cities do when they are booming and have to do something to better handle the traffic. These systems are not growth generators. Click to expand... I agree that the subway wouldn't draw more people to Detroit, but it would help positively differentiate Detroit from the surrounding suburbs and help stabilize population loss. I fixate on mass transit because imo it's low-hanging fruit that the metro Detroit region desperately needs to grab in order to not become even more irrelevant in the next 20 years. It won't fix everything, but it's not gonna hurt if planned well. It might make sense for politicians to heavily invest in Wayne State to turn it into a gee-whiz technical school in your scenario.","[0.5114924311637878, 0.48850753903388977]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5114924311637878
557,"Chicago lost ground as top tech jobs concentrated in just 5 metro areas, study says By Taylor Telford Washington Post | Dec 09, 2019 | 3:38 PM The San Francisco skyline is seen May 12, 2008, in a view from Alamo Square. San Francisco and four other metro areas accounted for 90% of the 256,063 tech jobs created from 2005 to 2017, according to a Brookings Institution study released Dec. 9, 2019. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP) The explosion of top-tier tech jobs has clustered in a handful of coastal hubs, expanding the wealth and innovation differential that's draining talent from the rest of the nation, new research shows..  Just five metro areas — Boston; San Diego; San Francisco; San Jose, California; and Seattle — snapped up 90% of the 256,063 tech jobs created from 2005 to 2017, according to a study released Monday by The Brookings Institution. The remaining 10% was divvied up among 377 urban areas. Advertisement.  The Chicago metro area lost 12,582 top-tier tech jobs between 2005 and 2017, the study said, though it named the Chicago area as one of 20 “superstar metro areas” with the largest numbers of jobs in innovation industries..  Other would-be hubs that saw their share of tech jobs shrink dramatically included Durham, North Carolina; Philadelphia; Dallas; and Wichita, Kansas, researchers found, with the bottom 90% of U.S. metro areas collectively losing one-third of these positions in the same period..  The result is a growing concentration of high-paying jobs that accelerates wage growth and, by extension, socioeconomic disparities. Income inequality is at its highest level since the Census Bureau started tracking it five decades ago, despite historically low unemployment and poverty rates. The gulf between the top and bottom is starkest in wealthy coastal regions which also command the highest numbers of tech workers. [Most read] Federal agents and Chicago police were confiscating drugs and guns from luggage when rapper Juice Wrld suffered seizure at Midway, officials say ».  The research by Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton of the Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program, and Robert Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation foundation, looked at employment in 13 ""innovation industries,"" which they defined as fields where at least 45% of the workforce has STEM degrees and where research and development investment per worker is $20,000 or higher. The industries range from aerospace to chemical engineering to software and data processing..  These positions make up just 3% of U.S. jobs, but generate 6% of gross domestic product and a quarter of exports. A third of innovation jobs are concentrated in just 16 counties, the report found, and half are compressed in 41 counties. The concentration is tied to the nature of technology: Progress and productivity increase more quickly in small areas with a wealth of resources and talent..  ""These places enjoy the benefits of what economists call cumulative causation,"" the report says, ""through which their earlier knowledge and firm advantages now attract even more talented workers, start-ups, and investment, creating a gravitational pull toward the nation's critical innovation sectors while simultaneously draining key talent and business activity from other places."".  The trend creates its own set of problems for the tech hubs, the authors note, including skyrocketing housing costs, worsening traffic, and wage expectations that can freeze out smaller companies..  But the economic prosperity is significant: in the 20 cities with the most employment in innovation industries, the average output per worker is $109,443, according to the report. That's one-third more than the other 363 metropolitan areas nationwide. [Most read] Friends rescue Chicago couple facing tragic end-of-life decision while living abroad ».  The machinations of the tech industry stand in stark contrast to manufacturing, where companies had to keep costs low to compete. Traditionally, economists believed that even regions that lagged the rest of the country would eventually catch up, once businesses relocated to avoid rising costs in more competitive areas. For much of the past century, lower-income states and metro areas saw faster wage gains and bigger growth and than higher-income ones..  When tech companies do move for lower costs, they're more likely to move outside U.S. borders to tech-dominant countries like China and India, the report says. And since the concentration of tech means that such redistribution won't come naturally, the report's authors contend, government intervention is needed.

558,"Reprints Print Stephen J. Serio.  Declaring Chicago needs to “chart an entirely new” development path if it is to succeed, Mayor Lori Lightfoot is giving a preview of her long-term plan to jolt new life into segments of the Chicago economy that have been lagging and to rebuild the city’s population..  In a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago tonight, the mayor identifies three industry clusters in which the city already is doing well, as well as four others that have strong growth potential. All will receive special planning assistance and financial and other help, though many details are yet to come. You can read the text of the speech below. Earlier Pritzker's Rx for Illinois' ailing economy.  What’s interesting is that the seven clusters include a mix of high-education sectors in which advanced degrees almost always are needed and other businesses that are open to those who may lack a college education but are otherwise qualified. All were designed to be resilient in the face of a fast-changing economy, officials said..  In the first category—which the city is calling foundational clusters—are industrials and manufacturing, food processing and manufacturing, and professional and corporate services, areas in which the city traditionally has had a solid presence both downtown and in outlying neighborhoods..  Targeted as growth clusters are transportation and logistics; technology, both pure services such as cloud computing and applications like advanced manufacturing; tourism and hospitality, and health care and life sciences..  Those are similar to clusters laid out recently by Gov. J.B. Pritzker with his recent state-wide development plan, and that’s intentional, because the two can build off each other, said city Deputy Mayor Samir Mayekar in a phone briefing..  Nor does the emerging plan amount to a local version of an industrial selection policy, Mayekar added. “We’re not picking winners and losers. We’re building areas of strength,” much like other cities have..  In her speech Lightfoot told the black-tie dinner crowd that Chicago has not had an actual land-use policy guiding what should go where since 1996..  “That means that where and how development happens is largely left to the vagaries of developers and aldermen,” she said, according to her prepared remarks. “And as a consequence, we have seen over time, communities south of Roosevelt Road and west of Ashland slowly but decidedly wither on the vine.”.  The result is violence, shortened life expectancy and population loss, she continued. “What we need now is to focus on how we move forward, together, as a city of inclusive growth and prosperity.” To do that, she said, the city must enact ethical reform so people trust government, make economic growth inclusive, promote education and health services for all and achieve full structural balance in its budget..  If that’s done, and the economic development plan succeeds, Chicago can rebuild its population back above 3 million people, she said. The current population of the city is estimated at about 2.7 million..  Lightfoot’s emphasis on transportation/logistics and some other sectors was perhaps expected, given the ongoing $8.5 billion terminal expansion project at O’Hare International Airport. But the focus on tech may surprise some..  ""The tech industry is the fastest-growing sector in Chicago’s economy. Meanwhile, Chicago has one of the largest pools of tech talent in the nation,” she said. “We will continue to build this sector out in every direction.”.  Details of how this all will be implemented are still a work in process. Mayekar said stakeholders in each of the seven industry clusters will roll out specific plans by the second quarter of next year, plans that will include city help with workforce development, planning, expedited permitting, marketing and perhaps unspecified financial incentives..  In the speech, she lays out neither the details of any incentives nor how the initiative will be funded and at what cost..  Lightfoot pointed to her $250 million Invest South/West program of intense capital spending on infrastructure in 10 neighborhood corridors as a guide for what will happen..  “And this isn't just about philanthropy,” she said. “There is business opportunity in our neighborhoods. In the Austin neighborhood on Chicago's West Side, 80 percent of retail spending—estimated at nearly $200 million annually—leaks to the neighboring suburbs.”.  There’s more to come, but it’s a start. And here's what former Mayor Rahm Emanuel proposed when he unveiled development plan in 2012. ","[0.5044130682945251, 0.49558696150779724]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5044130682945251

The shooting was “without apparent provocation,” Lisle police said after reviewing surveillance video, which initially shows several seated people watching a big-screen television. The footage shows the woman standing up, shooting one man in the back of the head and firing several rounds at two others, before shooting herself, police said. No one else was involved in the incident, reports WFSB ..  The business is located at 1600 Ogden Ave in Lisle, IL..  The names of the shooter and the victims weren’t immediately released pending notification of family members..  The shooting was contained to a single room within the building. According to its website, Humidor’s Lisle location features a total of nearly 12,000 square feet (1,115 square meters) of lounge space, including public and members-only lounges..  A motive in the shooting remains under investigation..   Lisle is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States. The population was 22,390 at the 2010 census, and in 2018 the population was recorded to be 23,394.

562,"Last week when Mayor Lightfoot announced she was dumping $250 million dollars into 10 South and West-side neighborhoods, saying it will bring ""transformative change"" I have to admit I thought of a famous quote by Alexis de Tocqueville. It kinda speaks for itself. That fine line between bribing the people with the people's money to curry votes and a real attempt to help people who are in need, have a history in America that came to a realization in 1964 when then-President Lyndon Johnson declared a ""WAR ON POVERTY."" The cost of that war cost American taxpayers some $23 TRILLION DOLLARS, which is 3 times the cost of all U.S wars since the American Revolution..  Yet progress against poverty as measured by the U.S Census Bureau has been minimal at best, and in terms of President Johnson's main goal of reducing the causes than the mere consequences of poverty have failed completely. The two main takeaways from the Census Bureau's report are:.  1. The lack of progress in building self-sufficiency since the beginning of the war on poverty 56 years ago is due in major part to the welfare system itself..  2. By breaking down the habits and norms that lead to self-reliance welfare generates a pattern of increasing intergenerational dependence..  Most of us are familiar with the famous quote by the Irish Philosopher Sir Edmund Burke, ""THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT."" I'm convinced Mayor Lightfoot is well aware of the history of the war on poverty but it's hard to get that other quote out of my mind by de Tocqueville, those last seven words 'BRIBE THE PEOPLE WITH THE PEOPLE'S MONEY. Since 1931 Chicago has been run by 13 Mayors, all Democrats. That's 89 years of one-party rule and we seem to still be at the point of utter frustration, dealing with poverty, violent crime, failing schools and colossal taxes on just about anything the politicians can think of. The latest being 2 major taxing grabs that were criminal acts a few years ago -- sports betting and marijuana legalization. Chicago's property owners are facing skyrocketing property taxes on houses that are plummeting in value. In order for the politicians to keep their wild promises, the public's money has to come from somewhere, which is from the public of course..  Back in 2014 Democratic Governor Patrick Quinn in a desperate failed attempt to hold off his challenger Bruce Rauner for another term as Illinois Governor came up with 55 million dollars to be distributed to Chicago in the guise of an Anti Violence program. Even Cook County prosecutors who sometimes are challenged to find an Asian at 22nd and Wentworth smelled a rat. Questions such as who got the money? who decided who got the money? where did the taxpayer money come from? Somehow, after Quinn was defeated it kinda all went away with little or no answers whatsoever. Imagine 55 million dollars of taxpayer money and no accountability. To some, it smelled an awful lot like an egregious attempt at what de Tocqueville described as bribing the people with the people's money..  All of this, of course, brings us to the present time in Chicago. Last week Mayor Lightfoot moderated a panel at the U.S Conference of Mayors, meeting in Washington D.C on preparing for solutions to mass shootings. She announced to the panel that Chicago deals with at least one mass shooting a week. Certainly not a startling revelation to anyone who hasn't been submerged under an ice shelf over the past few months. Of course, a room full of mayors from various municipalities is probably thinking to themselves geez ""what are they doing about it?"" Of course, the words GANG VIOLENCE remains the elephant in the room and the star attraction is as always according to Mayor Lightfoot ""TO MANY GUNS ON THE STREET."".  One has to wonder since guns are getting the blame just how all that came about over the last 89 years. I'm sure they would love to lay it all on Trump but then again people are not that stupid. Chicago's cops confiscated 10,500 guns off Chicago's streets, very few of the criminals arrested were held accountable, thousands of gun violators simply walking free in the same communities they have been terrorizing for decades, yet the theme of the panel was FEDERAL GUN CONTROL. Four hundred million guns estimated on hand in America and by God its time the Federal Government does something about it. So far most of those big-city mayors have yet to mention that over 80% of the gun violence in America's cities according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is GANG related. Yet not one politician at that Conference mentioned that..  They do however dump millions of dollars into one failed program after another in an effort to at least appear they are doing something. During the sixties and as we saw when Quinn decided to ship 55 million dollars to so-called anti-violence programs, the money disappears and the killings and violence never skips a beat. Back in the sixties, the Black Stone Rangers street gang wound up actually running the programs until several were indicted and imprisoned for stealing large portions of the war on poverty money. The GANGS are simply not going away and the sooner politicians realize that no community can thrive when you have thug killers infecting those communities..  Gangs cannot be bribed. They don't need to because they will end up with the well-meaning money anyway. Violence is a genetic condition. If someone doesn't break the chain, it's getting worse with every generation. Cops, unlike politicians, cannot, and do not turn their heads from ugly or grotesque scenes. Evil thrives in darkness until our politicians step up and shine a light on it (GANG VIOLENCE). It's not going to shrivel up and die anytime soon.","[0.5024763941764832, 0.49752363562583923]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5024763941764832

565,"Retired Illinois politicians have become pension millionaires and are getting richer by the day, while Illinois taxpayers lose their jobs, get behind on their mortgages and have trouble paying their bills, according to the most recent study of state pensions by the Taxpayer Education Foundation (TEF)..  “These bloodsuckers that raised state taxes billions of dollars, and then retired, are getting lavish, gold-plated pensions and benefits,” said James L. Tobin, economist and TEF president. “Their functionally-bankrupt state pension plan, the General Assembly Retirement System (GARS), like the other state pension plans, has been kept on life-support with billion-dollar increases in the state income tax.”.  “Thanks to the tax increases that many of these reprobates voted for, the state is economically dying and has lost population six years in a row.”.  For 2019 and 2020, two GARS pensions exceed $200,000. From 2019 to 2020, the number of pensions exceeding $100,000 has gone from 62 to 71, and the number exceeding $50,000 has gone from 218 to 221..  The highest annual pension, $265,428, goes to retired legislator Arthur L. Berman (D), the author of the failed Berman Tax Increase Amendment, which we helped defeat years ago. Berman’s total pension paid to date is $3,670,815..  A central figure responsible for much of the pension crisis is former governor James R. Thompson (R), one of the worst tax-raisers in Illinois history. Thompson currently receives an annual pension of $165,987. He has received a total pension to date of $3,219,842. His estimated lifetime pension payout is $3,385,829..  Former governor, Patrick J. Quinn Jr. (D), the so-called “reform” governor, currently receives an annual pension of $149,882. He has received a total pension to date of $694,733. His estimated lifetime pension payout is $3,255,658..  Former legislator and governor, James R. Edgar (R), receives a current annual pension of $175,952. He has received a total pension to date of $2,502,093, and his estimated lifetime pension payout is $4,755,649..  Edgar signed into law Senate Bill 3 in 1998, the biggest government pension increase in the history of Illinois. SB3 gave retired government teachers 75% of their salary at retirement, with annual compounded increases of 3 percent. SB3 will cost taxpayers $4.5 billion in 2020, which is 12% of the Illinois state budget!.  The taxes to support these outrageous Illinois government pensions are driving taxpayers out of Illinois. Almost all of the last $5 billion-dollar state income tax increase was used to prop up the state pension funds. This is why Illinois governor Jay Robert “J. B.” Pritzker (D) wants to pass his Nov. 3. 2020 Income Theft Amendment, a massive state income tax increase for Illinois taxpayers. Instead of seeking pension reform, Pritzker wants another massive income tax hike..  Pritzker is destroying the Illinois economy. He wants to place more taxes on the backs of the state’s taxpayers, while he stubbornly enforces the Soviet-style state shutdown. Pritzker should explore significant reforms to the state’s bankrupt pension plans for retired government employees. He wasn’t elected to declare war on the state’s middle class.","[0.7165274024009705, 0.28347262740135193]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.7165274024009705

567,"https://ift.tt/2XgFbEi.  SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) announced today that the unemployment rate jumped +12.2 percentage points to 16.4 percent, while nonfarm payrolls shed -762,200 jobs in April, as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact Illinois businesses and households, based on preliminary data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and released by IDES. The monthly unemployment rate rose to a new record high since current methodologies were enacted in 1976 and the monthly decline in nonfarm payroll jobs also set a record..  The March monthly change in payrolls was revised from the preliminary report from -34,100 to -60,900 jobs. The March unemployment rate was also revised from the preliminary report, from 4.6 percent to 4.2 percent, as a result of a downward revision to the number of people in the labor force in March..  The April payroll jobs estimate and unemployment rate reflects activity for the week including the 12th. The BLS has published FAQs for the April payroll jobs and the unemployment rate..  The state’s unemployment rate was +1.7 percentage point higher than the record high national unemployment rate reported for April, which was 14.7 percent, up +10.3 percentage points from the previous month. The Illinois unemployment rate was up +12.2 percentage points from a year ago when it was 4.2 percent..  The three-month average Illinois payroll employment estimate was down -278,200 jobs during the February to April three-month period, compared to the January to March three-month period. The largest average declines were found in Leisure and Hospitality (-107,800), Trade, Transportation and Utilities (-37,700) and Professional and Business Services (-36,800)..  “The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our economy, as has been the case in states across the nation,” said Deputy Governor Dan Hynes. “As we move to safely reopen much of our economy, we are focused on ensuring working families and small business have the resources they need to recover, and we urge the federal government to step up and provide additional relief.”.  “As Illinois tackles this unprecedented crisis, Governor Pritzker has taken action to support a swift public health recovery that will in turn enable residents and businesses to make an economic recovery,” said Erin Guthrie, Director of the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. “This administration’s focus on workforce development, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating new industries will help us start to bring Illinoisans back to work and rebuild our economy.”.  Compared to a year ago, nonfarm payroll employment decreased by -822,800 jobs, with losses across all major industries. The industry groups with the biggest jobs decreases were: Leisure and Hospitality (-320,500), Professional and Business Services (-119,800) and Trade, Transportation and Utilities (-110,000). Illinois nonfarm payrolls were down -13.4 percent over-the-year as compared to the nation’s -12.9 percent over-the-year decline in April..  The number of unemployed workers increased dramatically from the prior month, a +280.3 percent increase to 1,004,400, a new record high, and was up +270.6 percent over the same month for the prior year. The labor force was down -2.9 percent over-the-month and -5.2 percent over-the-year. The unemployment rate identifies those individuals who are out of work and seeking employment..  An individual who exhausts or is ineligible for benefits is still reflected in the unemployment rate if they actively seek work.

570," 5:00 PM Standing in a West Side park, surrounded by neighborhoods with some of the lowest response rates to the census in Chicago, state and county officials urged residents Tuesday to fill out their forms as soon as possible as the Trump administration continues to shift deadlines and create confusion. Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, center, stands for a photograph with others Sept. 29, 2020, in Douglas Park after a news conference about the 2020 census. (Jos M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) “We’re here to say that we’re going to continue to fight to count every single individual and to encourage everybody to complete the census,” said Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya. “At this point, our lives are in jeopardy, our future is in jeopardy, our schools, our health system, they’re in jeopardy, and it’s all because there’s been a political fight back and forth on when the deadline is.” Advertisement The official deadline was the end of July, but it was pushed back to Oct. 31 because of the pandemic. Then the Trump administration abruptly moved the deadline up to Sept. 30, despite warnings from the Census Bureau. Advocacy groups and civic organizations went before a federal judge to challenge new deadline, arguing more time was needed for an accurate count, especially in communities of color where response rates badly lag behind the national average. Last week, the judge scrapped the Sept. 30 deadline. Then early this week, the Trump administration announced it would end the count on Oct. 5, arguing the judge did not explicitly set a new deadline in her ruling. The judge has asked federal attorneys for documentation on the latest deadline. Advertisement In the meantime, state and county officials say they are working under the assumption that the count will end Oct. 5, and are instructing residents to fill out census forms immediately and be included in a count that will determine Illinois’ representation in Congress , as well as the state’s and city’s share of billions of dollars in federal aid over the next 10 years. Statewide, the self-response rate has already surpassed 2010 levels at just over 70%. But rates in Chicago continue to hover around 60%, with some neighborhoods reporting rates as low as 30%. Some of the city’s lowest rates are in neighborhoods around the park, such as Back of the Yards, West Englewood, Little Village and North Lawndale, all areas that have struggled with poverty and a lack of resources.

571,"HARRISBURG — A congressional district in southern Illinois is expected to disappear following the 2020 census, raising concerns from about the redistricting process that determines the number of seats a state gets in Congress..  The 15th Congressional District, which stretches across nearly 15,000 square miles of southern and central Illinois, will most likely be eliminated after the 2020 census because its population has been steadily dwindling, according to experts..  U.S. Census Bureau data shows that from 2013 to 2018, the district’s population dropped by about 14,000, to 690,000 — jeopardizing a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives because a congressional district must have roughly 710,000 residents..  Population drops allow lawmakers, particularly those in the majority party of a state, to redraw congressional district maps in a process called redistricting. In Illinois, Democrats dominate both the General Assembly and the governor’s office, empowering them to map the entire state’s congressional districts. Map drawing is slated to begin next year..  The redistricting calculus means that while a Republican candidate is expected to take the conservative district in November, the winner will likely serve just one term, the Belleville News-Democrat reported..  U.S. Rep. John Shimkus who currently represents the 15th District already declined to run for reelection after more than 20 years in Congress..  Sarah Drone, an Avon saleswoman from Harrisburg in southeastern Illinois, said that’s frustrating because rural cities like hers need representatives to help create more jobs and stop even more population loss..  “We’re already underrepresented around here, and we need more representation in Congress,” said Drone, who identifies as an independent. “But we’re used to it.”.  If the 15th District is eliminated, Democrats can draw a map that makes one of the other Republican southern districts, the 12th or the 13th, more competitive in elections, according to John Jackson, a visiting professor at the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute..  While U.S. Rep. Mike Bost, R-Murphysboro, has a firm hold on the 12th District, which covers most of deep southern Illinois, Republican U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis from Taylorville faces a close race in November..  “It’s going to be difficult for the Democrats to draw a map in these three districts that clearly advantages them,” Jackson explained. “They will look to places like Belleville and East St. Louis where there’s Democratic strength and they will try to get as many Democrats in (one district) as they can.”.  State Senate Minority Leader Bill Brady, a Republican from Bloomington, said he hopes Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker will support a joint resolution amendment that would change the Illinois constitution’s provisions on redistricting. The measure, which attracted broad bipartisan support, would make the mapping process fairer, Brady argued..  “The only way the governor can live up to his commitment and perception as well as reality is to help us push for fair maps,” Brady said.

575,"By Whitney Tesi Medill Reports Middle Eastern and North African communities have been lobbying for their own category on the census for decades, even though they have been classified as “white” since the government first started conducting the survey in 1790..  Although the idea for a Middle Eastern and North African category for this year’s census was considered under the Obama Administration, the plan was shot down two years ago after President Donald Trump was elected..  “More research and testing is needed,” Karen Battle, chief of the U.S. Census Bureau’s population division, said in a public meeting last year ..  Many community advocates said they were disappointed in the decision, saying the exclusion of the option ignores the challenges that Middle Eastern and North African people face as a marginalized group..  “It’s kind of creating this system of institutionalized invisibility,” said Amar Shabeeb, member of human rights group Organize 4 Syria..  With the census officially starting in two months, advocates are also afraid that the absence of a Middle Eastern or North African option will result in a lack of resources and awareness toward their communities. More than $600 million in federal funds are allocated to states and counties, which are dispersed according to the population total and breakdown on categories such as race and sex..  “How can we develop programs and services for a community that doesn’t exist?” said Itedal Shalabi, co-founder of the nonprofit social service agency Arab American Family Services. “We don’t have someone that looks like us, that speaks our language, or that understands us and can meet our needs.”.  In 2017, the American Community Survey, an annual survey of the U.S. population by the Census Bureau, estimated there were 2 million Arab Americans in the country. The Arab American Institute, a nonprofit organization, said they believe that the government undercounted by 48% and the actual number had been closer to 3.7 million. According to the Illinois Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, the current Arab population in Chicago is around 150,000..  Jihad Esmail, a Palestinian American student at Northwestern University, said he had always felt conflicted about marking “white” as his race when he was growing up. He added that the lack of the Middle Eastern and North African option excludes them from obtaining affirmative action resources that other people of color receive..  “We don’t get different opportunities through minority programs because we have to mark ‘white,’” Esmail said..  Shabeeb said one service the community needed was more language support such as translators, which it couldn’t get if they weren’t recognized..  “It illustrates to the community that the government doesn’t care about you,” Shabeeb said. “They don’t even attempt to reconcile our issues.”.  The recent killing of Qassem Soleimani and the resulting U.S. military tensions in the Middle East also have advocates concerned with the Islamophobia and racism they experience in America as a result..  Shalabi said that the fight for the category has been happening for over 30 years. She, along with other activists, said they are urging those who identify as Middle Eastern or North African to mark “Other” on the census and write down their identification..  “We’re teaching our community members about political power,” Shalabi said. “It’s kind of nice to be part of changing the history in a way that’s positive for future generations of Arab Americans. We’re labeled white, but we’re not treated as white.” Photo at top: The 2020 census race question.

Get more in-depth, daily coverage of Chicago politics at The Daily Line..  CITY HALL — Critics of a city-crafted plan designed to prevent longtime residents from being pushed out of gentrifying parts of Woodlawn near the planned Obama Presidential Center blocked the main entrance to Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s office Tuesday..  The protest was the latest effort by the Obama CBA Coalition, which comprises seven groups, to spur Lightfoot to protect low-income residents who fear the Obama Center will ratchet up housing prices and leave them homeless..  Holding signs shaped like the tents they fear they will be forced to live in once the center is built, several dozen protestors sat in front of the mayor’s fifth floor office, with two Chicago Police officers blocking their access into Lightfoot’s suite of offices..  The coalition has repeatedly urged the mayor to revamp her proposal — which officials are using to put together an ordinance to be considered by the City Council — to ensure that housing built on land now owned by the city is affordable to families earning $40,000 a year or less..  In addition, any new housing developments should be required to set aside 30 percent of their units for low- and moderate-income residents, according to the coalition’s proposal..  The coalition also demanded that the current proposal be expanded to include not only Woodlawn but also South Shore, Grand Crossing, Hyde Park, Washington Park and Kenwood..  RELATED : Coalition blasts scaled-back plan for preserving affordable housing near Obama Presidential Center.  A majority of aldermen have endorsed the coalition’s proposal for a community benefits agreement..  The Obama Foundation and former Mayor Rahm Emanuel rebuffed the coalition’s demand for a community benefits agreement, but Lightfoot promised during her campaign to back a legal measure..  Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), who has vowed to block Lightfoot’s proposal from becoming law, did not participate in the sit-in but was greeted with a loud round of applause when she arrived at the protest..  During the sit-in, Taylor told reporters that the mayor’s staff agreed to meet with the coalition..  “We don’t trust the city,” Taylor said. “We just don’t.”.  The meeting has not yet been scheduled..  The mayor met Monday with Taylor and Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th), who have been leading the push on the City Council to pass a community benefit agreement, said Anel Ruiz, a spokesperson for the mayor..  Additional conversations are expected to take place before the mayor asks the City Council to approve her proposal, Ruiz said..  Aides to the mayor and several commissioners have held 15 separate formal meetings with Woodlawn residents about affordable housing concerns, Ruiz said..  “We are committed to ongoing discussions with these stakeholders to make sure the concerns of the community are reflected in any affordable housing or economic development solutions for Woodlawn, while ensuring that there are no unintended consequences for the community,” Ruiz said..  RELATED: City’s Scaled-Back Obama Center Housing Plan Doesn’t Do Enough To Protect Woodlawn, Alderman Says.  Alds.

Taylor said the mayor’s proposal would not protect Woodlawn residents from being pushed out of the area around the Obama Presidential Center, set to be built in Jackson Park. In addition, the freshman alderman accused Lightfoot and housing officials of disrespecting the largely Black and low-income community by crafting their own proposal, rather than endorsing the plan backed by a coalition of community groups. If we don't get it, Shut. It. Down. #CBASitIn pic.twitter.com/VGcCsOCbTs — Coalition for a CBA (@ObamaCBA) February 11, 2020.  The mayor’s proposal would apply only to census tracts within three-fifths of a mile of the Obama Presidential Center. The proposed community benefits agreement backed by Taylor and the Obama CBA Coalition, which comprises seven groups, wants protections to apply to all properties within a two-mile radius of the center. While Woodlawn would be included in the mayor’s plan, most of South Shore and Washington Park would not..  During a meeting of the City Council’s Committee on Housing and Real Estate on Tuesday morning, Hadden asked Housing Department Managing Deputy Comm. Anthony Simpkins when the administration would back an ordinance with a “funding package for residents” of Woodlawn..  “Nothing is finailzed right now,” Simpkins responded. “I think we’re close, but we still have some more work to do with the elected representatives and people who live in that community.”.

577,"Illinois is not just losing population to other states, it’s losing working-age citizens — a key factor for a thriving economy..  Internal Revenue Service data shows that of the 87,882 people Illinois lost to other states in 2019, nearly 60 percent of them were prime working-age individuals between 26 and 54 years of age..  “Unfortunately, that has been the story with the labor force in Illinois for the last decade,” said Orphe Divounguy, chief economist at the Illinois Policy Institute in Chicago. “People looking for opportunity are going elsewhere.”.  Divounguy said the perception is that people are leaving the Land of Lincoln for the sunshine states, but that isn’t true..  “The majority of the people leaving are going to neighboring states,” he said..  It is also not a coincidence that the states with the fastest population growth are Texas, Colorado, Nevada and Tennessee, according to Divounguy..  “Those happen to be states with low income tax or no income tax,” Divounguy said, reinforcing the Policy Institute’s stance against the proposed graduated income tax in Illinois..  The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning noted that the working-age exodus is hitting the Chicago area hard, noting that in 2017, the Chicago region had 68,000 fewer workers age 25-54 than it did in 2010. Younger workers also are leaving the Chicago area, CMAP cited, with 20,000 fewer workers age 16-24 in the Chicago area in 2017 than in 2010..  “The Chicago region is alone among select peer metropolitan areas in losing workers” in both age cohorts, CMAP officials said in an August report about the Chicago area workforce..  CMAP’s analysis of American Community Survey data showed that of peer metropolitan areas, only Los Angeles also saw a decrease in its age 16-24 workers from 2010-17 but the “City of Angels” saw an increase of 20,000 workers age 25-54 during that same time frame..  Boston, New York and Washington D.C. all saw both categories of age group workers rise significantly during the same seven-year period..  CMAP’s analysis also indicated that low- and moderate-income residents are leaving the Chicago region, potentially in search on economic opportunity elsewhere. At the same time, the region is gaining high earners, suggesting that the region’s available employment options, quality of life and cost of living may better meet the needs of high earners rather than lower-earning individuals, according to CMAP..  “Taken together, this data suggests that while the Chicago region continues to attract working-age adults, it struggles to retain them,” CMAP officials said. “As the number of residents and workers leaving the region continues to increase and outnumber those entering the region, one of our primary economic assets — people — diminishes, undermining the region’s economic growth and competitiveness.”.  The Policy Institute’s Divounguy said that with technology advances more people can work remotely, even in a different state..  “If you are not constrained by your work location, you are going to go where the cost of living is much lower,” said the chief economist of the independent organization generating public policy solutions aimed at promoting personal freedom and prosperity in Illinois..  “If you are going to buy a house, you want to see appreciation,” Divounguy said. “The Illinois housing market is one of the weakest-performing in the nation. There are still homes that have less value now than before the Great Recession. We have seen housing prices recover in almost every other state.”.  He said because of recessed housing values and higher taxes, people in Illinois are paying higher monthly costs than people in other states..  “All the state’s problems contribute to people doing the math and people saying, ‘It’s time to go,’” Divounguy said..  People don’t realize the reasons for tax hikes — bad governance, corruption and unfunded pensions — they just know that their taxes are going up, he added..  Divounguy said economies grow because of people and great ideas..  “If fewer goods are purchased, fewer people are needed to sell those goods,” the economist said. “You need less talent and that affects job seekers. We make it difficult for someone who wants to invest in this state … When your state has the second-worst personal income growth, you are going to lose people.”.  kbeese@chronicleillinois.com.

Windhort’s district included the vast majority of the communities examined in The Southern’s report..  “When we say that the region is in crisis, it’s important to first understand the full depth of what that means,” the One Shawnee report reads. “In turn, it becomes clear that something must be done and illustrates why our work will be important.”.  Based on almost every measurable category, the poorest counties in Illinois largely reside in the Ohio River Valley and surrounding Shawnee Forest region, the report said. In the 10-county region, about 18% of people live in poverty, compared to 12% in the state as a whole. The childhood poverty rates are even more staggering. In 2017, Illinois’ child poverty rate was 17%. In the One Shawnee region, every county was above that rate with the highest being Alexander County, at 50%..  Data show that people are also less likely to finish high school, obtain post-secondary degrees, find meaningful employment or even live as long as their statewide peers. Every county in the region has a lower life expectancy than the state’s overall rate..  With job options declining, many of the region’s young people are moving on when they get the chance..  This 10-county region has a population of about 100,000 in 2018, U.S. Census Bureau figures show. That’s about 7% fewer people than lived there in 2010. During the same time, the state of Illinois lost fewer than 1% of its population, according to One Shawnee’s report..  26-Delivered.

579,"Two ideological heavyweights sparred Wednesday in Chicago not only about Illinois’ proposed progressive income tax change, but about whether high taxes cause people to leave. Truth in Accounting’s panel discussion at the Union League Club in Chicago featured Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability. Martire was an architect and chief proponent of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s proposed progressive tax amendment that will be on the November 2020 ballot. Should it pass, it would change Illinois’ Constitution to allow the state to tax income above certain thresholds at higher levels, something Martire said was necessary to make the state’s tax system more equitable. “Our income tax can’t be designed to respond to how income is distributed over time, to respond [to] ability to pay, and to treat taxpayers fairly,” he said. Radio host and former candidate for Illinois governor Dan Proft cut at Martire’s notion that increasing taxes would not exacerbate the state’s population declines. “It provides neither the tax relief promise nor the path to stable state services or balanced budgets,” Proft said. Illinois and West Virginia are the only states that have seen at least four consecutive years of population loss. Martire, using California and Minnesota’s population gains as an example, said there’s no peer-reviewed evidence that ties high taxes to people leaving a state. “There’s never been any statistically meaningful correlation between tax policy and migration,” he said. Proft pointed to Southern Illinois University at Carbondale’s Paul Simon Public Policy Institute polling, which found that about half of those asked said they’d thought about leaving the state and the most common reason cited was high taxes. “So, the next time you run into somebody that says ‘I’m leaving the state because of taxes’ tell them they are a liar and Ralph Martire says so,” Proft said. Martire said Illinois, when measured correctly, was actually a lower-taxed state. Both received Union League Club mugs for their participation.

The Illinois Legislative Latino Caucus Foundation (ILLCF) invites the public to attend its scholarship luncheon and discussion of the growing power and influence of Chicago’s Latino community. This has been a historic year for Illinois Latinos: a legislative session produced a record number of laws advancing Latino equity, from immigrant protections to capital and infrastructure development. The ILLCF conference is an opportunity for Latino leaders to come together to develop a strong policy agenda in preparation for Census 2020 while also recognizing emerging leaders and their significant achievements in our community: this year, for example the foundation will be distributing $2,000 each to 25 students. The conference is set to take place 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Friday, Nov. 22 at Hilton Chicago/Oak Brook Hills Resort & Conference Center, 3500 Midwest Rd., Oak Brook, Illinois 6052.

584,"The World's Columbian Exposition Travel tips for Chicago from 1893 Last edited Thu Nov 21, 2019, 09:01 AM - Edit history (1).  Really interesting article in The Reader:.  ?cb=1574205394.  ?cb=1574205394.  If you could go back in time to see the World's Columbian Exposition, how would you prepare for life in Chicago? Here are some suggestions drawn from travel guidebooks for Chicago and from advice printed in newspapers from around the world..  According to the 1890 census, Chicago was 98.6 percent white. (For contrast, according to 2018 census figures, Chicago is currently 32.7 percent white.) The English-German Guide of the City of Chicago and the World's Columbian Exposition, a guidebook targeted at tourists from Germany, noted that visitors might get by in Chicago speaking only German. Nonwhites might not face the same rigid segregation as in the American south, but private businesses such as hotels and restaurants could find excuses to turn customers away. ""No sensible white person feels aggrieved when he rides from Van Buren street to the Fair grounds . . . on a seat shared by a decent colored person,"" explained one Chicago newspaper in an editorial against a vaudeville theater that had required Blacks to sit in a ""colored gallery,"" which cost three times more than general admission. In her autobiography, Ida B. Wells recalled going to lunch with Frederick Douglass near the close of the fair. She brought up a nice restaurant across the street, one that didn't serve Blacks. Douglass grasped her arm and said, ""Come, let's go there."" The waiters at the Boston Oyster House seemed ""paralyzed."" The owner of the restaurant recognized Douglass and greeted him warmly. This was enough to get service..  A correspondent from the Pall Mall Gazette told its London readers to bring galoshes. The English-German Guide concurred: Chicago streets ""are dirty to an extent incomprehensible to Europeans."" Street fashion in this part of America, the guidebook maintained, was sehr einfach: very simple. ""Jewelry and loud clothing ought to be avoided, the attention of dangerous characters being attracted by them."".  Though costs decreased over the summer, it was still easy to blow a fortune at the Columbian Exposition itself. The Santa Fe Daily New Mexican reported one visitor's deluxe day trip. Paying to be wheeled around the fairgrounds in rolling chairs and to navigate lagoon waters in gondolas, the traveler ""bought catalogues and guidebooks, saw all the wonders of the Midway Pleasance [sic], had lunch and dinner at the swell cafes and brought innumerable souvenirs."" He shelled out $30 for the daya total that when adjusted for inflation is about $855..  https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/travel-tips-worlds-columbian-exposition-1893/Content?oid=75678862.

585,"From the Union League Club of Chicago, November 20, 2019 - Conservative commenator and radio host, Dan Proft debates Ralph Martire of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, over the question of whether voters should do away with Illinois' Flat Tax on income, and replace it with a Progressive Tax. A ""Progressive Tax"" applies a higher rate of taxation on higher incomes, whereas the state's current income tax is 4.95% on everyone. Mr Martire and the Governor argue that requiring a higher income person to pay a higher percent on their incomes is fair. But those who support the state's Flat Tax on income -- so called because it is the same tax rate on all levels of income -- note that the higher income earners ALREADY pay more of their income in taxes because they make more. A person making $1,000,000 a year would currently pay $49,500 in Illinois income taxes, versus an average wage earner making $40,000 that pays just under $2,000 in income taxes. Gov Pritzker wants those making over $250,000 a year to pay 7.75% and those making over $500,000 to pay 7.85% on their income. His administration argues that would bring the state an additional $3.4 Billion in annual revenue. Martire says other states - like Minnesota -- have a much higher tax rate than Illinois, and their states are still doing well economically. But Proft and others note that the state and the City of Chicago are already losing population every year. Martire says that's NOT due to the high taxes in Illinois, but to the weather. Dan Proft points out that many who have moved noted they did so due to high taxes. Proft also notes that the state of Illinois has the highest PROPERTY TAXES in the nation. He says the combination of high property taxes, driven by what Proft says are unsustainablely high pension benefits [ that now consume about 26% of the state budget], are what are the real cause for Illinois' financial crisis.

587,"A 102-year-old former Chicago teacher donned an unconventional outfit to cast her vote Thursday — a pink and white, full-service hazmat suit..  A picture on the Chicago Teacher’s Union Twitter account captured the moment Beatrice Lumpkin dropped her mail-in ballot into a USPS box: “Good morning! This is 102-year-old CTU retiree Bea Lumpkin casting her vote-by-mail ballot,” the union wrote..  “If Bea can do it, anyone can do it. Vote!”.  The longtime Chicago teacher was surrounded by fellow Chicago Teacher Union members as she fulfilled her civic duty, according to Fox News ..  “Bea is truly universally beloved in our union, where she remains an active and dedicated retiree who shows up at as many picket lines and union events as she can, and remains very active in our work, plus writes occasionally for our monthly member publication, Chicago Union Teacher, most recently on the desperate need to address climate change,” a spokesman for the CTU told the network..  Lumpkin, despite her age, remains active in the union and, until the pandemic hit, regularly attended protests along with her fellow members — in March of 2019, CTU posted a video on Facebook of her at the age of 100, protesting at the Chicago International Charter School headquarters..  According to the US Census Bureau , people who are 65 and over are more likely to vote. 71 percent of Americans who are 65 and over showed up to the polls in 2016 while only 46 percent of 18 or over Americans turned out to the polls.","[0.5177538990974426, 0.482246071100235]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5177538990974426
588,"SPRINGFIELD (WSIL) -- The Illinois Department of Agriculture (IDOA) has announced $5 million in business recovery funding for livestock producers and small meat and poultry plants impacted by the coronavirus pandemic..  The new funding is part of the state’s Business Interruption Grants (BIG) program, which uses federal CARES Act money to help small businesses that incurred losses in connection to COVID-19..  “Illinois remains a leading agricultural state in the nation, and I’m proud to help farmers build on that success by providing needed grants to help offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “On behalf of all Illinoisans, I want to offer my appreciation to the members of our agricultural community whose hard work has ensured food was available amidst the worst pandemic of our lifetimes.”.  “Since the beginning of the pandemic, our Department has worked closely with the agriculture industry to understand and respond to the challenges they currently face,” said Acting Director of IDOA, Jerry Costello II. “I’m proud of the way Illinois’ farmers, small businesses and commodity groups came together to keep the food chain secure. These dollars enable farmers’ continuity of operations while providing our small meat and poultry plants the ability to make necessary improvements to expand animal throughput and capacity.”.  Financial assistance will be made available through three programs administered by IDOA:.  Swine Depopulation Program: Covers the costs and expenses of swine producers associated with the depopulation and disposal of livestock due to the disruption of the livestock market caused by the COVID-19 emergency on or after April 15, 2020. Applicants are eligible to receive up to $10,000 for losses. Agriculture Business Interruption Program: Covers monetary losses and expenses of livestock producers due to the disruption of the livestock market caused by the COVID-19 emergency during the period of April 15-May 15, 2020. Eligible expenses are costs associated with holding livestock (swine, beef cattle, dairy cattle, lambs, poultry and meat goats) and livestock-related products for an extended period of time. Applicants are eligible to receive up to $10,000 for losses. Meat and Poultry Capacity Program: Covers costs for operations and costs associated with facility improvements necessary to decrease or eliminate COVID-19 related slowdowns and mitigate capacity reductions. Businesses must have no more than 60 employees. Applicants are eligible to receive up to $25,000 for eligible expenses. Online applications are available through October 31, 2020..

589,"The jury is in on Madigan — even if the Democrats refuse to see it But those who follow this closely believe it’s going to take more than what’s in play so far to deny Madigan the support of 60 House Democrats — the number needed to re-elect him speaker. Two people who might have the biggest say in changing that aren’t even part of Madigan’s majority: U.S. Attorney John Lausch and Gov. J.B. Pritzker. If Lausch returns a big indictment against former ComEd officials and Madigan’s associates, expanding on the case laid out in ComEd’s deferred-prosecution agreement — and gets it done before Democrats meet in January to pick the new speaker — that could alter the dynamic. Even then, it probably would require a push from Pritzker, the party’s de facto leader, who has been loath to take on the speaker directly. Some think that could change if Pritzker’s graduated income tax constitutional amendment falls short, with Madigan partly to blame for its defeat as Republicans point to him as a symbol of government distrust. But if that happens, Pritzker might need Madigan’s help to pass an income-tax increase,or whatever other measures he’d pursue after being denied the anticipated revenue from the state’s wealthiest taxpayers. It might take nothing short of an indictment of the speaker to convince House Democrats it’s time for a change in leadership. Why do Madigan’s members stick with him? It’s a number of things from what I can tell: loyalty, respect, fear. Not just fear of what Madigan might do in retaliation but of the unknown, of what might happen without him. Fear of how they would raise campaign money or manage their campaigns because, at the moment, he handles those things. And not to be underestimated: fear of the new map, with political redistricting scheduled in the coming term. Legislators always are interested most in self-preservation, and the map can make or break them. If Madigan draws the map, they know he’ll protect them if they protect him. Under Madigan, House Democrats are accustomed to winning. They win elections. They win legislative battles. They’re not keen on giving up any advantage he gives them for the devil they don’t know. Even progressive Democrats who would seem to have little in common with Madigan’s politics tend to fall in line for all of the reasons above — and because he helps them achieve their legislative goals. African American legislators, in particular, are expected to be supportive of Madigan. Beyond tending to feel strongly about the importance of “innocent until proven guilty,” they’re looking to him to protect them in the coming remap, no simple matter with population losses in Chicago’s Black communities. They also are counting on his pledge to support their agenda addressing systemic racism, seizing on the momentum growing out of the social unrest sparked by the killing of George Floyd. At a Legislative Black Caucus news conference Thursday in Chicago, I didn’t find anyone willing to commit to backing Madigan. They said they will be awaiting his customary call, usually in the week before the November election, asking them to commit to voting for him. It’s also an opportunity, of course, for legislators to win commitments from him. Some day, Illinois will have a new speaker of the House. Not everyone can imagine it.

593,"Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia discusses COVID-19 and the Illinois Hispanic community with Gov. J.B. Pritzker in a Facebook live event on Monday, May 18. Facebook screenshot Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, D-Ill., on Monday pressed Gov. J. B. Pritzker to make sure Hispanics who know their communities are part of the army of COVID-19 contact tracers the governor wants to recruit. Garcia discussed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Illinois Hispanic population in a conversation on Facebook live conducted in English. The infections have hit a disproportionate share of Hispanics, and Pritzker highlighted that there are 66 testing sites in Illinois established in areas with a large number of Hispanic residents. Garcia, the only Hispanic congressman in Illinois, has been scrambling to find state and federal resources to help battle the pandemic with a special focus on immigrants, no matter their legal status. Pritzker spoke to Garcia after his afternoon briefing, where he spotlighted the state of Illinois efforts to ramp up the hiring of contact tracers. The job of a contact tracer is to patch together the network of people in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 so they can be tested for the disease. The governor, at his briefing said, “With Illinois’ daily availability of testing among the best in the nation now, we want to grow our voluntary contact tracing so that we can further control and reduce the rate of spread of COVID-19 and stop outbreaks in their tracks.” Garcia told Pritzker there are a “robust” number of people in Hispanic neighborhoods who have contact tracing skills through their field work in the Census, voter registration and similar jobs. He asked the governor what his plans were to insure that “Latinos and immigrants are included” in the contact tracer hires. Pritzker replied that he wanted to “encourage anybody who is listening” to apply for the paid jobs, highlighting there will be a need for Spanish speakers. Garcia said, “Keep in mind, Governor, there is a body of these folks who are experienced, who people trust and they know how to knock on doors when it is safe to do so.” Pritzker encouraged people interested in the job to check out how to submit a resume on the Illinois Department of Public Health website at dph.illinois.gov/COVID19 . Hiring will be done by county health departments; the state will act as a clearinghouse for resumes and help pay the salaries. Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh says the jobs are likely part-time and temporary and will be paid about $15-an-hour. The state will give money to counties for contact tracers based on where there is the most need – the hot spots.

599,"CHICAGO (CBS) — How do you get help to the most vulnerable during the pandemic?.  Start by identifying where they live..  CBS 2’s Jim Williams reports some public officials are using an old tool..  One Chicago alderman started with a question: Who among his constituents on Chicago’s northwest side were most vulnerable to COVID-19?.  He looked at census data..  “Where are the folks that have lowest median income,” asked Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th.) “Working poor people struggling paycheck to paycheck. Where do we have the oldest folks, the highest median age?”.  The groups hardest hit by the coronavirus. Census data shows the alderman that in his 35th ward, they live largely in neighborhoods like one at Kostner, north of Armitage.  “These are the specific blocks where we think there’s going to be a lot of people who are going to be very vulnerable to COVID-19.”.  Identifying those areas makes it easier for the alderman to offer help. Ramirez-Rosa said many in that area don’t have computers and the internet. So he created an old fashioned newsletter to tell those constituents where they could get services during the pandemic..  He and his staff passed out 7,000 copies..  “What the newsletter said was call my office. We’re here to help. To let you know where the nearest food pantry can be found and let you know how to apply for unemployment,” he said..  Ramirez-Rosa said Logan Square has had 1.9 COVID-19 deaths per 1,000 residents. But the nearby Hermosa neighborhood, he said, has had 3.9 deaths per 1,000 residents..  “When you have such a powerful pandemic like this, unfortunately those that are already suffering hit even harder,” Ramirez-Rosa said. “And that’s why we constantly have to have policies that prioritize the most vulnerable among us.”.  The alderman said as a result of that newsletter, his office has received 600 calls a week from people seeking help.

601,".  Chicago, Circling The Drain.  By Francis Menton.  My first blog post on the subject of Chicago was way back in 2012. In that post, I placed Chicago in the special category of American cities that I called the “basket cases” — places with declining populations, astoundingly high rates of violent crime, in every case mostly black on black, and, of course, uninterrupted rule by leftist Democrats for generations. I had this to say about Chicago:.  You may ask, is Chicago really basket case? . . . The downtown is in good shape, with new condos and office towers; the near north side is upscale and attractive. But the population has gone from a peak of 3,620,962 in the 1950 census to just 2,695,598 in 2010. [And if instead of staying downtown you take] the Green Line el south from the loop to the end of the line, . . . you will observe huge deteriorated public housing projects surrounded by vast vacant areas and abandoned private buildings..  The violent crime rate also clearly qualifies Chicago for the label of basket case. Murders hit a peak of 756 in 2016 (about 28 per hundred thousand people, compared to a rate for the U.S. as a whole of about 5 per 100,000). After a few years of modest declines, murders are on track to equal or top the 756 this year, with 440 through July. In fact, July 2020 just set a new record for most murders in a month, with 105..  Of course, Chicago has been ruled entirely by Democrats for generations. Its last Republican mayor left office in 1931. Of 50 alderman in the city, 46 are Democrats and the other 4 are Independents. In the 2016 election, the city of Chicago voted for Clinton over Trump by 84% to 13%..  Which brings us up to the last couple of days. Apparently, on Sunday there was an incident where the Chicago police shot and injured a black suspect. The police claim that the suspect was armed and had shot at them first; but they have no video to prove that. Whether the police behaved wrongly remains to be established, and if they did, the officers in question should be dealt with accordingly..  But there is no justifying what followed. On Sunday night into Monday there was a first wave of looting in the downtown area. On Monday, the Chicago chapter of Black Lives Matter put out a press release that dropped all pretense of “peaceful protests” and explicitly sought to justify the looting, while also threatening further violence:.  The mayor clearly has not learned anything since the killing of George Floyd in May, and she would be wise to understand that the people will keep rising up until the CPD is abolished and our Black communities are fully invested in. Contrary to Mayor Lightfoot’s position, Black lives are and always will be more important than downtown corporations who siphon Tax Increment Financing (T.I.F.) money, while avoiding taxes, and exploiting the labor of Black and Brown Chicagoans. These corporations have “looted” more from our communities than a few protesters ever could. . . . Some commentators seem to believe that the immense wealth that has been hoarded in downtown Chicago is in some way all of ours. The South and West sides have seen no benefits to this hoarding. . . . When protesters attack high-end retail stores that are owned by the wealthy and service the wealthy, that is not “our” city and has never been meant for us..  Then last night, a second wave of looting erupted in Chicago, including both in the downtown and in the luxury shopping district just north of downtown known as the “Miracle Mile.” There are many videos of the looting, which appears to have been orchestrated on social media..  I’m just completely mystified about the thought process. Let’s assume the worst for the police as to the incident on Sunday. Even so, how is that somehow a bigger issue than the well-over-300 blacks murdered so far this year in Chicago by people who are not the police? And again, even if you assume the worst about the police incident, how is looting an appropriate response? Encouraging young black people to go out on looting sprees is making them completely unemployable in any professional job and ruining whatever chance they might have had for high paying jobs and careers. The demonstrators shout “black lives matter” while they destroy black lives by the hundreds or thousands..  We are witnessing the complete dead end of the progressive movement in Marxist idiocy.

603,"By Gary Lucido , today at 7:45 am If you time your home sale or purchase right youcan get a better deal.  About a year ago I looked at the best time to buy or sell a home in Chicago from a supply and demand perspective. Theoretically, looking at the market that way should get you the best price for a home sale or purchase. However, what does the data actually tell us? Well, I've done this before - a long time ago and it's time for an update..  The Case Shiller index folks produce two sets of home price indices for the Chicago area. The un-adjusted indices are what I report on every month. It's just the regular indices that show price levels as they are without any seasonal adjustments. When you look at my graphs you can clearly see a seasonal pattern in the data. That's why the Case Shiller folks also produce a seasonally adjusted set of indices, designed to remove seasonal effects. I compare the two to determine how much of a seasonal impact they think exists and we can look at that to figure out when prices generally peak or bottom out during the year..  They get their adjustment factors by feeding their un-adjusted indices into a software program maintained by the US Census Bureau - the X-12-ARIMA seasonal adjustment program. Sounds sexy, right? I have no idea how it works and my guess is that nobody else knows either, other than the people who built it. But we'll trust it anyway. Here is how those seasonal factors have varied over time. Chicago area home prices have a significant amount of seasonality that has varied over time.  I have no idea why the seasonality would vary over time but I guess it's possible. The people who created the black box that spit out these values would probably tell us that it's just the way it is..  The most recent peak value occurred in August 2019 at 1.7% and the lowest point occurred in February at -1.8%, which is a 3.5% total swing. Also, keep in mind that the Case Shiller index is a 3 month average so the August number is more like July and the February number is more like January. Also, keep in mind that this is based on what closed at those points in time so the contracts were written 30 - 60 days prior and if you want to get a contract in one month you probably need to be on the market a month before that..  So, based on this data, I would say that to get the highest price when selling your home you want to hit the market in May and to get the lowest price when buying a home you want to start looking in November. Both of those time frames are shifted a little later in the year than my analysis last year would suggest..  #HomeSelling #HomeBuying #ChicagoRealEstate.

(SPRINGFIELD) The Illinois Department of Employment Security is partnering with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR), the Division of Banking and Division of Financial Institutions, to work with financial institutions in detecting and combating unemployment fraud. Most of the fraud can often be identified early on at the financial institutional level, therefore coordinating and engaging financial institutions as a resource has been a proven and successful approach in identifying fraudulent actors and detecting and recovering improper payments. Most recent data show there to be approximately 107,000 fraudulent claims affecting the federal payment system since its launch on May 11, with just 14,500 fraudulent claims affecting the regular unemployment system since the first of March..  (CHICAGO) Attorney General Kwame Raoul, as part of a coalition of 14 states, yesterday filed a federal lawsuit challenging drastic operational changes at the U.S. Postal Service that threaten critical mail delivery and could undermine the national election in November in which record numbers of Americans are expected to vote by mail due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The coalition asserts that the Postmaster General has acted outside of his authority to implement changes to the postal system, and that he did not follow the proper procedures required by federal law to enact such sweeping changes. Three other Midwestern states have joined Illinois in the lawsuit action. They include Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota..

Built in three phases from 2001 to 2009 and then renovated in 2017, the community was acquired about a year ago by a St. Louis-based real estate investment group and its operating partner, Compass Senior Living . The community is still stabilized but has seen improvements to both census and profitability in the last year..  To refinance the acquisition debt and return capital to the investors, Monarch Advisors secured $6.4 million in senior debt from a regional bank, with a five-year term and competitive interest rate. The loan, which has an interest-only period for up to 18 months, also includes a draw-down feature which will allow the investors, upon achieving certain performance hurdles, to recover all of their original investment.

Homebuyer demand pushed Illinois home sales and median prices higher in March even amid lower inventory and increased restrictions related to COVID-19, data from Illinois REALTORS® shows..  Statewide home sales (including single-family homes and condominiums) in March totaled 12,182 homes sold, up 4.7% from 11,637 in March 2019..  The statewide median price in March was $217,000, up 8.5% from March 2019, when the median price was $200,000. The median is a typical market price where half the homes sold for more and half sold for less..  “Illinois benefited from a strong start to the 2020 housing market and that momentum continued in March with solid gains in home sales and median prices, even as COVID-19 began to have a greater impact on the overall economy,” said Ed Neaves, president of Illinois REALTORS® and designated managing broker of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Snyder Real Estate in Bloomington..  The time it took to sell a home in March averaged 63 days, unchanged from the year before. Available inventory totaled 46,852 homes for sale, a 10.6% decline from 52,404 homes in March 2019..  According to the data, home sales in the Champaign-Urbana MSA (Champaign, Piatt and Ford counties) totaled 214 units, a 7.0 percent increase while the median price was up 1.7% to $150,500; home sales in the Peoria MSA (Marshall, Peoria, Stark, Tazewell and Woodford counties) totaled 409, a 4.9% increase while the median price increased 12.2 percent to $122,000..  The monthly average commitment rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.45% in March, a decrease from 3.47% the previous month, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. In March 2019, it averaged 4.27%..  In the nine-county Chicago Metro Area, home sales (single-family and condominiums) in March totaled 8,579, up 4.2 percent from March 2019 sales of 8,231 homes. The median price in March was $260,000 in the Chicago Metro Area, an increase of 7.9% from $241,000 in March 2019..  “The March data on the housing market are probably the last to reflect the pre-pandemic impact of the economy,” said Geoffrey J.D. Hewings, director of the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory at the University of Illinois. “Unlike the recession that started in 2008 when there was a gradual increase in unemployment for the next several years, the events of the first quarter of 2020 have revealed a precipitous decline in employment levels (and a concomitant increase in unemployment rates). The consumer sentiment indices reported this month, most notably the decline in the Fannie Mae Home Purchase Sentiment Index, suggest that over the coming months, we can expect to see a growing negative impact on housing prices and sales.”.  The city of Chicago saw year-over-year home sales increase 1.0% with 2,082 sales in March, compared to 2,062 a year ago. The median price of a home in the city of Chicago in March was $320,000 up 10.1% compared to March 2019 when it was $290,700..  “Though we likely won’t see a fuller picture of coronavirus’ impact on the housing market until April’s numbers are released, we are happy to see positive momentum in March,” said Maurice Hampton, president of the Chicago Association of REALTORS® and owner of Centered International Realty. “Clearly, demand kept pace, despite the pandemic, with an uptick in closed sales and sales price over last year. However, we also saw a sharp decline in inventory, something we will continue to keep our eyes on for the future, as homeowners react to the uncertainty of the current environment.”.  Sales and price information are generated by Multiple Listing Service closed sales reported by 26 participating Illinois REALTORS® local boards and associations including Midwest Real Estate Data LLC data as of April 7, 2020 for the period March 1 through March 31, 2020.

608,"The 2020 census may cause Illinois to lose another seat in the House of Representatives if the population continues to decline, and SIUE could lose a voice in Washington. Senior mass communications major Allison McDonald, of Perryville, Missouri, has been tabling for the Illinois Public Interest Research Group to get students to pledge to participate in the census. “It is your civic duty to complete the census, and if people don’t do the census, they’re not getting counted,” McDonald said. “If they’re not getting counted, then we could lose seats in the House of Representatives.” The census was originally intended to determine how many representatives each state gets, but the way the data is used now raises the stakes. James Hanlon, a geography professor, says this could mean less funding for federal programs in certain states. “Government funds are often allocated for various programs on the basis of population,” Hanlon said. “So if people go uncounted, then from the government’s point of view there are fewer people living in this location, and that can mean less funding.” States don’t always lose seats due to declining population. Sometimes they lose them in order to make up for states that are experiencing a rapid increase in population. Hanlon said Texas is the most likely to gain seats. “Places in the sun belt, like Texas, are growing so they’re going to get more seats and the total is fixed at 435,” Hanlon said. “With Illinois kind of being in the rust belt and not seeing a lot of population growth, places like Illinois, Michigan or Minnesota are going to be more likely to lose seats, so it's not unique to Illinois. Some collection of states are going to have to give up a seat, at least to make up for the sun belt states that are growing.” Many have been speculating which district the state may be losing. Andrew Theising, a political science professor, believes it will be District 15. “I think it's the 15th District that’s going to go away and that’s what’s being vacated by [Representative] John Shimkus,” Theising said. “John Shimkus is a Republican in Illinois that’s a Democratic state. Shimkus was very powerful in his position but because he’s not running again he can’t quite say we’re throwing this politician out, but rather he’s not running again and we’re not going to let anybody fill that seat. So District 15 will just make one less Republican seat in a Democratic state. That’s my guess.” Losing District 15 could mean SIUE has one less advocate in Congress. “SIUE has a lot of national government grants that help make things go, so we need a good relationship with our national government. Technically the campus is in the 13th District, but Glen Carbon is in the 15th [District] and you could be in Glen Carbon in 2 or 3 minutes,” Theising said. “I know John Shimkus has been a voice for our campus in Washington and has been our advocate there, as I’m sure Representative Rodney Davis is too. That’s just one less voice for SIUE in Washington. I hope that the representative who takes over the piece of land that was the 15th district will be a strong voice for SIUE as well.” Hanlon, however, thinks that the loss of a seat won’t have a significant impact for the campus. “The funding part shouldn’t be affected very much because the funding for SIUE depends a lot more on the political climate in the state,” Hanlon said. “As we know we have a governor now that has quite a different outlook on funding for higher education compared to the previous governor. Those kinds of factors matter a lot more than, say, population counts.” Regardless of the new population count, each state is required to redistrict because the population within a state may move around. This is where partisan motivations come into play, according to Hanlon. “Redistricting happens no matter what after a census and that is a very contentious process. There are always conflicting interests particularly along partisan lines. As far as who controls where the boundaries get drawn, in Illinois and most states it's the party that’s in power,” Hanlon said. “There are a few states that have independent commissions that are meant to draw boundaries in a way that is not partisan, favoring one party or another, but in most states like Illinois it's the party who’s in charge who has the pen to draw the lines on the map.” Hanlon believes those partisan borders are even apparent in our district, District 13. “If you look at the district it reaches down and grabs Edwardsville and SIUE, it reaches over and it grabs Springfield, it reaches up and it grabs Bloomington, it reaches over and it grabs Urbana-Champaign,” Hanlon said. “It’s got some bumps around the edges that look very consciously like attempts to create a district that would be more likely to vote Democrat.” Despite pushes by the Trump administration, there will be no citizenship question on the 2020 census. Theising believes that discouraging immigration as President Trump has hurts the economy. “We need that as part of a growing, dynamic economy and we just aren’t seeing that. Immigrants play a big role in Illinois’s economy and St. Louis’s economy and even here at SIUE, think about how many international students and teachers and administrators we have here,” Theising said. “When the national government says we want to curb immigration we should be thinking about how that curbs our local economy, that curbs our university’s potential. That means our districts aren’t going to grow and that means we risk losing another congressional seat.”.  According to the census website , invitations to participate in the census will arrive March 12-20 and households can complete the census once they receive the letter. Participants will fill out the questions for wherever they are living on April 1, which means students will fill it out for wherever they’re living during the semester.","[0.5016036033630371, 0.49839645624160767]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5016036033630371
609,"The 2020 census may cause Illinois to lose another seat in the House of Representatives if the population continues to decline, and SIUE could lose a voice in Washington. Senior mass communications major Allison McDonald, of Perryville, Missouri, has been tabling for the Illinois Public Interest Research Group to get students to pledge to participate in the census. “It is your civic duty to complete the census, and if people don’t do the census, they’re not getting counted,” McDonald said. “If they’re not getting counted, then we could lose seats in the House of Representatives.” The census was originally intended to determine how many representatives each state gets, but the way the data is used now raises the stakes. James Hanlon, a geography professor, says this could mean less funding for federal programs in certain states. “Government funds are often allocated for various programs on the basis of population,” Hanlon said. “So if people go uncounted, then from the government’s point of view there are fewer people living in this location, and that can mean less funding.” States don’t always lose seats due to declining population. Sometimes they lose them in order to make up for states that are experiencing a rapid increase in population. Hanlon said Texas is the most likely to gain seats. “Places in the sun belt, like Texas, are growing so they’re going to get more seats and the total is fixed at 435,” Hanlon said. “With Illinois kind of being in the rust belt and not seeing a lot of population growth, places like Illinois, Michigan or Minnesota are going to be more likely to lose seats, so it's not unique to Illinois. Some collection of states are going to have to give up a seat, at least to make up for the sun belt states that are growing.” Many have been speculating which district the state may be losing. Andrew Theising, a political science professor, believes it will be District 15. “I think it's the 15th District that’s going to go away and that’s what’s being vacated by [Representative] John Shimkus,” Theising said. “John Shimkus is a Republican in Illinois that’s a Democratic state. Shimkus was very powerful in his position but because he’s not running again he can’t quite say we’re throwing this politician out, but rather he’s not running again and we’re not going to let anybody fill that seat. So District 15 will just make one less Republican seat in a Democratic state. That’s my guess.” Losing District 15 could mean SIUE has one less advocate in Congress. “SIUE has a lot of national government grants that help make things go, so we need a good relationship with our national government. Technically the campus is in the 13th District, but Glen Carbon is in the 15th [District] and you could be in Glen Carbon in 2 or 3 minutes,” Theising said. “I know John Shimkus has been a voice for our campus in Washington and has been our advocate there, as I’m sure Representative Rodney Davis is too. That’s just one less voice for SIUE in Washington. I hope that the representative who takes over the piece of land that was the 15th district will be a strong voice for SIUE as well.” Hanlon, however, thinks that the loss of a seat won’t have a significant impact for the campus. “The funding part shouldn’t be affected very much because the funding for SIUE depends a lot more on the political climate in the state,” Hanlon said. “As we know we have a governor now that has quite a different outlook on funding for higher education compared to the previous governor. Those kinds of factors matter a lot more than, say, population counts.” Regardless of the new population count, each state is required to redistrict because the population within a state may move around. This is where partisan motivations come into play, according to Hanlon. “Redistricting happens no matter what after a census and that is a very contentious process. There are always conflicting interests particularly along partisan lines. As far as who controls where the boundaries get drawn, in Illinois and most states it's the party that’s in power,” Hanlon said. “There are a few states that have independent commissions that are meant to draw boundaries in a way that is not partisan, favoring one party or another, but in most states like Illinois it's the party who’s in charge who has the pen to draw the lines on the map.” Hanlon believes those partisan borders are even apparent in our district, District 13. “If you look at the district it reaches down and grabs Edwardsville and SIUE, it reaches over and it grabs Springfield, it reaches up and it grabs Bloomington, it reaches over and it grabs Urbana-Champaign,” Hanlon said. “It’s got some bumps around the edges that look very consciously like attempts to create a district that would be more likely to vote Democrat.” Despite pushes by the Trump administration, there will be no citizenship question on the 2020 census.

Since 2015, almost 50,000 black residents have left,"" writes Julie Bosman. She explores the exodus of African-Americans from Chicago through the experience of three generations of the White family..  The Whites have owned a house on the city’s West Side since the 1960s, but some family members have stayed while others have moved to the suburbs or cities far from Chicago..  For the older members of the White family, leaving Chicago was not their first choice. Others saw educational and economic opportunities outside of the city, including in places such as Houston. They say that they do not regret leaving and do not anticipate ever returning..  ""[Blacks] have been driven out of the city by segregation, gun violence, discriminatory policing, racial disparities in employment, the uneven quality of public schools and frustration at life in neighborhoods whose once-humming commercial districts have gone quiet, as well as more universal urban complaints like rising rents and taxes,"" says Bosman.

612,"Illinois home prices, especially in the Chicago area, appreciated at the slowest pace in the nation last year, growing just below the rate of inflation. One of the fastest-growing areas in the nation, according to a new report, was right next door to Illinois. In Indiana, Porter County-based real estate agent Judy Fischer said one of every ten home sales she sold in 2019 went to people moving from Illinois. “It’s been a lot more interest in the last three years,” she said. “Twenty years ago, you did not see that at all.” Jeff Safrin calls northwest Indiana “a Chicago suburb” because its within driving distance of Chicago and because one-fifth of the homes he sold in 2019 was to former Windy City residents. “The inquiries have been on the increase for the last two or three years,” he said. “Especially after this year, to be honest with you.” Both Fischer and Safrin said Chicago-are residents are often shocked to see how much house they can afford in Indiana compared to suburban residences, but property taxes aren’t the only reason their buyers say they’re looking elsewhere. “Whether it’s automobile taxes, whether it’s property taxes, all of it starts to play a role for relocation,” Safrin said. The in-flow of Chicagoans is one of the key reasons behind the Gary area’s 7.9 percent increase in home prices year-over-year, according to an analysis of home price indices from the third quarter of 2019 by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, higher than all but six areas nationwide. “The fast rate of growth in Gary because people can still commute to the Chicago labor market is, I think, evidence of how costly they believe it would be to live right over the line notwithstanding the long commute they’re engaging in,” said Lynn Fisher, FHFA senior advisor for economics. “This is probably the starkest example that we’re seeing right now.” Illinois’ high property taxes, Fisher said, combined with population losses and uncertainty about future tax increases all affect home values. “There’s a lot of uncertainty around the state’s budget so it’s not what it is right now but what it could be in the future that could be having an impact on the state,” she said. Welcoming more than 16,000 people from Illinois, Indiana was the top destination for people leaving the state, according to Internal Revenue Service returns from the 2014 tax year. The report listed Illinois' home price growth at 1.89 percent in the twelve months that ended in the third quarter of 2019, lower than any other state. “If [Illinois] was at the U.S. average, those homes would have appreciated by about 33 percent total so it’s just about half the rate of growth,” she said.

JB Pritzker gestures July 16 while meeting with people at City Market in Rockford after his visit to promote the 2020 Census. As a public service, Shaw Media will provide open access to information related to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) emergency. Sign up for the newsletter here.  Illinois has set a new high for the month of July in confirmed positive cases of COVID-19. A total of 1,598 more people tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday..  Gov. JB Pritzker again cautioned residents to remain vigilant during a Wednesday news conference. As other states across the country continue to see high case counts, particularly in the south, the governor said his office and the Illinois Department of Public Health are keeping a close eye on Illinois’ rising positivity rate..  “We’ve seen real progress over these last four and a half months, but our numbers now appear to be gradually rising,” Pritzker said. “And that’s very concerning.”.  Illinois’ positivity rate is at 3.2%, up from 2.6% two weeks ago. IDPH Director Ngozi Ezike said the rise in cases is not a result of more testing..  “If you do more testing, your positivity should go down,” Ezike said. “For it to stay flat suggests we’re seeing increased transmission.”.  An increase was expected when Illinois moved to Phase 4 of Restore Illinois, Ezike said..  Every state surrounding Illinois has “double or triple our positivity rate,” the governor said. Even so, Pritzker has no plans to stop people from coming in and out of Illinois. Nor, the governor said Wednesday, does he have the power to do so..  That means Illinoisans need to double down on the tactics that helped the state limit the spread in June..  Pritzker said choosing to go out in public without a mask is not a political statement..  “It demonstrates a callous disregard for the people in your community and in your county and in our state and our nation,” Pritzker said. “The enemy is not your mask. If you’re not wearing a mask in public, you’re endangering everyone around you, so the enemy is you.”.  Ezike likened not wearing a mask to not wearing a seat belt in a car. Seat belts save lives, Ezike said, and so do face coverings..  “So what’s the controversy?” Ezike said..  Unemployment scam: Pritzker warned residents about a scam uncovered by the Illinois Department of Employment Security..  Anyone who did not apply for unemployment benefits but who receives an IDES debit card in the mail should immediately call IDES at 800-814-0513. Do not activate the debit card and have credit reports checked for potential fraud..  According to an IDES news release, scammers likely are using people’s personal information to apply for unemployment benefits. They likely obtained personal information through a prior cyber hack or data breach, potentially years ago, such as the Equifax breach in 2017..  Pritzker said this scam is happening in every state.

630,"11.  By: Ted Dabrowski and John Klingner.  When Paul Serwatka, the reform-oriented mayor of the small Village of Lakewood called it quits on Illinois more than a year ago, he and his family picked out the area of Huntsville, Alabama, for their new home..  “Alabama?” a couple of his Illinois neighbors asked. But Sertwatka isn’t alone in heading for Alabama. It’ s attracting many Illinoisans because parts of the state are booming in jobs, investment and population. And it costs a lot less to live there. Serwatka says “we’re not looking back.”.  More than 29,000 Illinoisans have moved to Alabama since 2010, according to U.S. Census data. In contrast, just 15,000 Alabamians moved to Illinois over that same time period..  Illinois was the 2nd-highest net supplier of residents to Alabama over the period..  Like most states in the country, Alabama is beating Illinois in the competition for people and their incomes. It’s going to take a lot of structural changes in Illinois to reverse those numbers..  Unfortunately, the only ideas politicians have for Illinois are higher taxes, including property taxes and progressive income tax hikes . Not only will they make it more expensive to live in Illinois, but they’ll drive more people out and depress home values even more. Wirepoints has covered both trends in detail in our out-migration series and property tax research ..  Picking Alabama.  Serwatka’s flight from Illinois is all the more interesting because he did what few other local politicians in Illinois could manage: He passed major fiscal reforms in his community..  During his time in office, Serwatka lowered Lakewood’s city property taxes by 10 percent without service cuts. He also scrapped a previously approved $66 million TIF before it could break ground, resulting in a tax refund for some residents..  Wirepoints covered Serwatka’s efforts here , here and here ..  But his successes as mayor were overrun by the failures coming from state politicians. Higher property taxes and income tax hikes were their only answers to the pension mess . And top-down controls were creating more economic havoc for small cities..  Serwatka worried about his young family and their future. So he did what so many families have done in the last two decades. They did the math and decided to flee..  In all, Illinois has lost people, on net, to 39 other states over the past decade according to state-to-state migration data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Loses to its neighbors have been particularly large, with Indiana and Wisconsin netting more than 100,000 Illinoisans each. The number of people Illinois gained from the remaining 10 states is small in comparison..  Serwatka originally focused his search in Tennessee, but he quickly found that property values and taxes had already crept up as a result of the flight to the Nashville area. He felt he’d already missed the boat..  But Alabama, especially northern Alabama, still looked good..  “Never mind the stigma,” Serwatka told Wirepoints. He did his homework and was confident about the move. He now has a bigger house on several acres and pays a fraction of the property taxes he used to – just $2,200 a year now vs. the $15,400 he paid on his home in Illinois..  “ We have no doubts we made the right decision for our family, and our bank account is already up more than $20K just in tax savings,” Serwatka said..  On top of all that, the area where he lives is flourishing..  Huntsville, Alabama, nicknamed the Rocket City and home to the ASA/Marshall Space Flight Center, is experiencing rapid growth. It’s booming in investment, jobs and population to the point where the city is facing growth-related problems..  Mazda Toyota Manufacturing USA is moving forward with 4,000 new jobs and a $1.6 billion investment for a new plant. Facebook is building a $750 million data center in Huntsville..  And the FBI is adding 1,350 positions at the Redstone Arsenal..  “Who knows,” said Serwatka, “my property value could double in the next five years.” With AAA-rated Huntsville on track to become the largest city in Alabama within six years , that just might be possible..  Left behind.  Funny enough, while some Illinoisans made fun of Serwatka for moving to Alabama, the stigma of being an Illinoisan followed him down south. His new neighbors were worried Serwatka would bring “Illinois politics and policies” to Alabama..  Luckily, Serwatka could point to his reforms as an Illinois mayor to overcome their concerns. But Alabamians are right to be worried about Illinois’ politics and policies..  Politicians’ poor decisions are why Illinois has lost more population than any other state in the nation. Illinois is one of just three states to lose population since 2010..  What’s amazing is that state politicians seem to think Illinoisans won’t leave no matter how bad finances get or how high taxes go . That’s the theory pushed by many proponents of the progressive tax..  But the data clearly shows otherwise. Illinoisans are already leaving in record numbers and going just about everywhere else in the country. Even Alabama ..

631,"On June 27, 1925, Chicagoans were talking secession. Maybe Chicago should break off from Illinois and form a new state. The Illinois Constitution was being violated. Every ten years, following the federal census, the legislative districts were supposed to be redrawn. That hadn’t been done since 1901. Downstaters controlled the state legislature. Letting Chicago have more seats would take away their power. So the legislature had simply refused to redistrict after the 1910 census. They had again refused after the 1920 census..  According to Alderman John Toman, the city deserved five more state senators and fifteen more state representatives. So Toman offered a resolution to the city council—that the city’s lawyer should investigate how Chicago might secede from Illinois. The resolution passed unanimously..  Obviously, there were going to be problems. The U.S. Constitution specifically stated that no new state could be carved from part of an existing state unless the existing state approves it. Would downstate be willing to let Chicago go, and lose all that tax revenue? Probably not. But perhaps sometime in the future. Besides, there were ways of getting around the Constitution. Kentucky was a part of Virginia in 1792, Maine was a part of Massachusetts in 1820, and West Virginia was a part of Virginia in 1863 during the Civil War..  The proposed State of Chicago would take in all of Cook County. Suburbia was tiny in 1925. Out of 3 million people in the county, about 2.7 lived within the Chicago city limits. The secessionists said they’d consider including DuPage and Lake counties, too..  Most Chicagoans seemed to like the idea of being a separate state. Along with being freed from the downstate dictators, Chicago would enjoy more clout on the national stage. The new state would rank 11th out of 49 in population..  Even if the plan didn’t become a reality, the threat was worth making. “Chicago is having trouble getting a square deal from the state,” a South Side electrician said. “I believe the only way to get back at them is to rebel. That would give them something to think about.”.  Faced with all the legal roadblocks, secession talk eventually died out. During the 1960s, the U.S. Supreme Court’s various “one man, one vote” rulings gave the city its fair share of legislature seats..  This is not the first time in the state's 200+ year history that there have been attempts to separate portions of the state to form a new state..  Between 1840 and 1842, several northern counties in Illinois, including Jo Daviess County, Stephenson County, Winnebago County, and Boone County, voted to reattach to Wisconsin, from which the counties were ceded to Illinois by Congress in 1818. The split was precipitated by the mutual antagonism between northerners and southerners due to social and political differences. The split was never realized due to lack of support from Chicago and Cook County, as the benefits of the Illinois and Michigan Canal linking northern to central and southern Illinois outweighed secession. Nathaniel Pope was responsible for giving Illinois its shape..  In 1861, the southern region of Illinois, known as Little Egypt, proposed secession due to cultural and political differences from Chicago and much of Central and Northern Illinois..  In the early 1970s, residents in western Illinois were upset over the allocation of state funds for transportation, prompting a student at Western Illinois University to declare 16 counties the Republic of Forgottonia . In 1981, State Sen. Howard Carroll passed a Cook County state split bill through both the State House and Senate..  In 2011, a similar proposal for Chicago to secede was introduced by two state legislators..  On February 7, 2019, State Representative Brad Halbrook, with co-sponsors Representatives Chris Miller and Darren Bailey, filed a resolution that urges the United States Congress to declare the City of Chicago a state and separate it from the rest of Illinois. None of these bills were ever implemented..  Compiled by Neil Gale, Ph.D. Presented by the Digital Research Library of Illinois History® and the Living History of Illinois and Chicago® Community.

633,"How many Blacks died in Waukegan and North Chicago of COVID-19? Posted By 2475.  By Erick Johnson.  North Chicago and Waukegan have large Black populations. Both cities have some of the highest COVID-19 cases in Lake County. But few know how many have died from the disease..  The Crusader has learned that neither the Lake County Coroner’s Office nor the Lake County Health Department is providing that information, saying their data system doesn’t allow them to do so. Several requests for important information under the Freedom of Information Act have resulted in a fruitless search during the coronavirus pandemic..  North Chicago and Waukegan are respectively located 34 and 42 miles from Chicago. According to the U.S. Census, Black residents make up 25.5 percent or 7,043 of North Chicago’s population of 29,615..  State health data show that North Chicago has had a total of 590 residents in two zip codes test positive for COVID-19. In zip code 60088, where many whites live close to the shores of Lake Michigan, 45 people have tested positive for the virus..  Zip code 60064 is where most of the city’s Black residents live, according to data from the U.S. Postal Service. Here in North Chicago’s inner city, there are 545 COVID-19 cases, which is 12 times higher than their counterparts across town in zip code 60088. The number of those who died from the disease remains a mystery.Further north is the city of Waukegan. According to the U.S. Census, Blacks make up over 17 percent or 14,633 of the city’s population of 86,075. In zip code 60085, where most of the city’s Black residents live, 2,145 people have tested positive during the outbreak. That’s 48 times higher than the number of cases in the city’s other zip code, which it shares with North Chicago. Here, with just 45 cases, the numbers are likely smaller for each city in this shared zip code..  Like North Chicago, the number of COVID-19 deaths in Waukegan remains unknown..  For two weeks, the Crusader spoke to several officials in Lake County, the seat of North Chicago and Waukegan. The Crusader also sent two FOIA requests to the Lake County Coroner’s Office. FOIA Officer Alexandra Reynoso responded with a letter that said the office does not have a search system that matches the information requested..  She referred the Crusader to Lake County Coroner Howard Cooper, who said his office doesn’t have data on COVID-19 victims because they are natural deaths. He said the Lake County Health Department should “definitely” have that information..  It did not..  When the Crusader sent a FOIA request for information on COVID-19 victims by city, race and zip code, FOIA Officer Lisa Kroeger said the health department doesn’t have that specific information. When the Crusader emailed another FOIA request for deaths based on the zip code, Kroeger provided a link to the Lake County Health Department’s COVID-19 dashboard, which doesn’t list deaths by race or zip code. The dashboard reports the total numbers of COVID-19 deaths in the county, along with cases by zip code, which also can be found on the state’s COVID-19 website..  Meanwhile, the death toll has slowed down as the positivity rate has declined in predominately Black cities or towns with large Black populations outside Chicago..  Twenty-nine people have died from the disease in Oak Lawn and 658 have been infected during the outbreak..  In Chicago Heights, 22 people died from the COVID-19 virus and 797 have been infected. In Country Club Hills, 18 people have died and 389 have been infected with the virus..   ","[0.5065271854400635, 0.4934728443622589]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5065271854400635
634,"Illinois seems to lead the nation in categories that you really don't want to lead the pack in. However, when it comes to being hated by other states, we're not even in the top ten..  I hesitate to use the word hate when we're talking about state-to-state relations, but that's the way the folks at BestLifeOnline decided their survey should be worded. And, their rankings are determined by haters from other states combined with the way residents feel about their own state..  Here's how BestLifeOnline came up with the numbers:.  We started off by calculating the percentage of the population that has recently moved out of each state. While locals don't give reviews of their hometowns like they would a restaurant on Yelp, they do tend to vote with their feet, so we compared the population increase or decrease in each state to the national average of 0.6 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Next, we analyzed a Gallup poll of which citizens felt the most pride in their home states—defined as the percentage of people who agreed with the statement that their state is ""the best or one of the best possible states to live."" The states with the least pride ranked higher in our Hatred Index. Finally, we looked at the findings of illustrator and amateur researcher Matt Shirley, who polled his 320,000 Instagram followers from across the country in 2020 to discover which state they hate the most..  Like most things in life, it's not official until Instagram weighs in..  So, let's start by taking a look at the top ten most hated states before we get to Illinois' numbers.

636,"The new proposal would apply only to census tracts within three-fifths of a mile of the Obama Presidential Center, as opposed to the proposed community benefits agreement which would apply to all properties within a two-mile radius of the center..  The city’s new proposal also doesn’t include a “pilot zone” that raises affordability requirements for new construction, a major component of the proposed community benefits agreement..  Leaders of the Chicago Department of Housing have “landed on six key components” of a potential ordinance after “months of engagement and collaboration with Woodlawn residents and other stakeholders,” city housing commissioner Marisa Novara told reporters on Thursday..  Freshman Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) and South Side community groups have demanded that the Obama Foundation and city officials agree to a “community benefits agreement” to blunt the effects of gentrification near the planned Obama Presidential Center site. The foundation and former Mayor Rahm Emanuel rebuffed those calls, but Mayor Lori Lightfoot promised during her campaign to back a legal measure..  Housing officials developed a “framework” for a potential ordinance after convening a “working group” including South Side Together Organizing for Power, the Coalition for a CBA, nonprofit developer Preservation of Affordable Housing and the University of Chicago, Novara said..  “We emerged from that with some important themes, including that everyone who lives in Woodlawn now should be able to stay in Woodlawn,” Novara said. “If we can do that, Woodlawn can grow in a way that is inclusive, affordable and provides an opportunity to build wealth through increased homeownership.”.  The commissioner said her department is “actively working” with city attorneys to draft an ordinance that includes the following six “key components:”.  • Allowing tenants “right of first refusal” if their landlord seeks to sell their building, giving them “the right to form a tenant’s association and enter into an agreement with a not-for-profit affordable housing developer to purchase the building and maintain it as affordable.”.  • Expanding the The Preservation of Existing Affordable Rental program, an Emanuel-era initiative to help apartment landlords refinance their buildings in exchange for entering into covenants promising to keep their units affordable..  • Offering grants for longtime homeowners to repair their houses so that they can “age in place” instead of being forced to move..  • Creating a “residential acquisition and rehabilitation revolving finance facility” to help finance the rehabilitation of vacant buildings..  • Setting “guidelines” for selling and developing city-owned land into affordable and mixed-income housing..  • Setting “enhanced local hiring requirements” for development on city-owned land..  Housing officials do not support creating a “pilot zone” requiring 30 percent of units in any new development requiring a zoning change to be set aside as affordable, which was a major plank of the “CBA Housing Ordinance” ( O2019-5589 ) introduced by Taylor and 28 other aldermen last summer..  Novara said her department is waiting for its 20-member Inclusionary Zoning Task Force to unveil its recommendations for the Affordable Requirements Ordinance before it gets behind sharpening the ordinance’s teeth in Woodlawn..  City leaders are looking for ways to draft a comprehensive zoning policy applying to all the city’s gentrifying neighborhoods, instead of creating one-off policies for different parts of the city, the commissioner added..  “We’re actively exploring whether it’s time for geographically-based pilot areas to sunset all together, so did not make sense to create a new pilot…while we’re looking for solutions for the city at large,” Novara said..  The existing Affordable Requirements Ordinance requires 10 percent of units in any new development that requires a zoning change to be set aside as affordable, but developers can opt out of most of that obligation by paying an “in-lieu-of fee” into the city’s Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund..  City officials would not say if the new proposal would replace or modify the existing community benefits agreement proposal stalled in committee..  “We’re not at that point yet,” Novara said..  Input on the proposal was gathered from a working group, comprised of community groups like the Obama CBA Coalition and “broader stakeholders” like the University of Chicago and the Obama Foundation, that began meeting in October, Novara said..  Last week, Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) told Block Club she had discussed a proposal to reserve 75 percent of vacant city-owned land in the CBA coverage area for affordable housing..  Taylor added that she had been working with the Housing Department to solicit more community input, and that they were aiming to schedule “larger conversations” with residents about the CBA by the end of January..  An open house on the department’s proposal will be held from 5-8 p.m. Jan. 30 at Hyde Park High School, 6220 S. Stony Island Ave..  Do stories like this matter to you?

A native of tiny Velma, Oklahoma, population 664 in the most recent census, Diffie was voted Best All-Around Male Athlete his senior year in high school. He grew up in a musical family. His dad picked guitar and banjo, while his mother sang..  However, his early ambition was in a different vocation. He planned to attend medical school after graduating college, but elected to get married and work in the oil fields, then pumping concrete and finally labored nine years in a sweltering foundry..  During this period, he was a member of the gospel group Higher Purpose and bluegrass band Special Edition. He was engulfed in music, and even had a recording studio in his home. There were countless highs and lows in his personal and professional life before he decided to migrate to Nashville in 1986..  He found a job at the Gibson Guitar Corporation, honed his songwriting skills and became one of the most sought-after demo singers in Music City, performing songs that were ultimately recorded by Ricky Van Shelton, Alabama and Billy Dean..  Diffie was discovered and signed by Bob Montgomery, a successful songwriter who was also vice president of A & R for Epic Records. Forced to wait until the label fulfilled obligations to others artists on its roster, Diffie made good use of his spare time by inking Hollie Dunn hit “There Goes My Heart Again.”.  In 1990, Diffie's debut album, “A Thousand Winding Roads,” was released. He was thrilled when opening single “Home” went to No. 1, then realized he may have star potential with follow-up “If You Want Me To.”.  “I never will forget it. I was driving around Nashville and ‘If You Want Me To’ came on the radio,” he says. “I started punching the dial and all three major country stations in town were playing my song at the same time. It freaked me out.”.  Diffie has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1993, the same year he won Vocal Event of the Year honors from the Academy of Country Music for his contribution to the George Jones single “I Don’t Need Your Rockin’ Chair.” He won a Grammy Award in 1998 for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for “Same Old Train,” a duet with Marty Stuart..  Diffie’s legacy as a skilled stylist was cemented in 2012 by Jason Aldean, who smashed up lines from several Diffie hits on tune “1994,” a tribute to the impact Diffie has made on the country music world..

Reprints Print GettyImages.  If the nation’s longest recorded economic expansion somehow hasn’t already set off sparks in the housing market, three economists who spoke at real estate forecast events said last week, don’t expect this year to be any different. “Considering we’re 10 years out from a global recession, by all measures we should be throwing a party,” George Ratiu, senior economist at Realtor.com, said at a 2020 forecast event hosted by the Chicago Association of Realtors on Jan. 9 at the Swissotel in Lakeshore East. Yet the housing market, in Chicago in particular, “is nowhere near where we should be.” That’s despite the fact that “it’s a very good time to buy a home,” Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, said at the event. The stock market, employment and consumer confidence are all high, and interest rates are low. Dennis Rodkin.  George Ratiu of realtor.com and Lawrence Yun of the National Association of Realtors.  William Strauss, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, echoed them the next day. “Housing has been improving at a modest pace for years, and it’s expected to do the same,” Strauss said at a separate forecast hosted by the suburban Mainstreet Organization of Realtors at the Medinah Shriners banquet facility in Addison on Jan. 10. The most positive aspect of the economists' outlook is that they don’t expect Chicago’s real estate market to turn negative. “We now have 126 consecutive months of growth, besting 120 months in the 1990s,” Strauss said, “and I’ll give you a heads-up: Growth is likely to continue out for the next several years.” While people often say that a recession is “due” because of the economy’s established cycle, Strauss said, the shallow growth of the current expansion may be the very reason it’s lasted so long and will continue. Strauss said he sees no big economic shocks ahead that might push the market down, but that at the same time, “there aren’t positive shocks coming” either. Mainstreet Organization of Realtors.  William Strauss of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.  What does this mean for Chicago’s housing market? While both Strauss and Yun described the year ahead as, essentially, more of the same weakness, Ratiu offered a specific forecast: As Crain’s reported in December, Realtor.com expects Chicago-area home sales to decline by 0.9 percent in 2020, and prices to dip 0.3 percent. That’s essentially flat with 2019, particularly on prices..  At least 14 of the biggest 100 U.S. cities are expected to decline more than Chicago, in Realtor.com's forecast. The economists offered some reasons that have become familiar: ongoing population loss and high property taxes. In Illinois, “half a million people are employed in state and local government,” Ratiu said. “I’m just going to point out that has an effect on your taxes. I’ve heard taxes are a problem in Chicago.” Yun said a factor that’s hurting Chicago’s market is a national problem as well. “There’s not enough inventory for sale at the midprice level, midprice and below,” which he put in the $200,000s. “That’s where most of the buyers are,” he said. There are two key reasons for the lack of Chicago-area homes available for sale at that price level: Vast numbers of homeowners in our slowly rising market are upside down on their mortgages and can’t afford to put them on the market with the prospect of having to show up at the closing with cash to fill in between the sale price and mortgage debt. And builders of new homes can’t afford to build at low prices in many of the areas where young households want to be, such as the city’s hot neighborhoods in the West Loop, along the Milwaukee Avenue corridor and the Near Southwest Side. “I would say—builders, build midpriced homes and you can sell them,” Yun said, though he acknowledged that making the numbers work is a challenge.

639,"Reprints Print VHT Studios.  This newly built house on Woodlawn Avenue in Glenview sold for a little under $1.54 million in December..  Sales of Chicago-area homes at $1 million and up fell in 2019, after increasing each of the previous four years..  Last year, 2,519 homes in the seven-county Chicago area sold for $1 million or more, according to a report compiled by Mary Jo Nathan, a Compass agent in Roscoe Village. That’s down 6.5 percent from 2018..  The median price of homes in the million-dollar market increased slightly last year to $1,327,500, up 1 percent from the year before..  In every year from 2015 through 2018, the number of sales increased, although a cooling trend showed up in 2018, when sales were up only 1.7 percent after a spike of nearly 10 percent the year prior..  Crain’s was not tracking million-dollar home sales prior to 2015, so it’s not possible to say how much further back the increases in sales volume might stretch..  Some of the reasons are familiar to anyone who’s been monitoring Chicago’s real estate market: high property taxes, the uncertainty about how much higher they’ll go as the city and state work to fill their pension-debt holes, and population loss, which diminishes demand for homes..  “There’s really been a negative sentiment in the market,” said Jeff Lowe, a Compass agent who is among the leading local agents for buyers and sellers of high-end homes..  For some households, the city’s bumper crop of lavish new apartments offers an alternative to buying a million-dollar home and comes with an easier exit strategy than having to sell it later..  Beyond those factors, agents told Crain’s, the fault lies with a shortage of desirable homes in the price point..  For the city alone, the drop was slightly larger than the regionwide figure. In Chicago, 1,294 homes sold for $1 million or more in 2019, down 7.5 percent from the year before..  Nathan said she believes a key reason for the drop in the city is a slowdown in construction of new single-family homes in neighborhoods like Lakeview and North Center after a mid-2010s surge that led to an oversupply and the usual result: sagging sale prices..  At the same time the final product’s sale price was dipping, Nathan said, “it costs more to build and more to buy land.” In recent years in North Center, the cost for a builder to buy a two-flat in teardown condition has risen from about $650,000 to the $725,000 range, Nathan said. “It’s harder to make those numbers work, so the builders have gotten cautious.”.  A related culprit is the surfeit of homes built in city neighborhoods in the years leading up to the housing bust, Lowe said. Many of them are dated now, but their sellers either don’t see it or can’t afford the upgrades needed to make their homes market-ready..  “Those mid-2000s homes are a big problem in the $1 million to $1.3 million range,” he said. Buyer shun them, opting to wait until more up-to-date inventory becomes available. These are the city neighborhoods with the largest numbers of million-dollar home sales in 2019, according to Nathan’s report. The sales total is for both houses and attached housing (condos and townhouses). The figure in parentheses shows the increase or decrease from 2018. Near North: 339 sales (+10.1%) Lincoln Park: 307 sales (+27.4%) North Center: 129 sales (+6.6%) Lakeview: 125 sales (-18.8%).  The big uptick in Lincoln Park was accompanied by decreases in median sale prices (down almost 8 percent for houses, to about $1.66 million, and down 1 percent for condos and townhouses, to just under $1.3 million). “Some sellers have been coming to their senses and adjusting their prices” downward, Lowe said..  Both West Town and Logan Square saw declines in the number of houses that sold for $1 million or more. (They have few condos and townhouses in the price range.) In West Town, 88 houses sold, a decline of 6.4 percent, and in Logan Square, 63 sold, down 16 percent from 2018. These are the suburbs with the largest number of million-dollar home sales in 2019, according to Nathan’s report. The figure in parentheses shows the increase or decrease from 2018.","[0.5011368989944458, 0.4988631308078766]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5011368989944458
640,"Aug 11, 2020 / 06:17 AM CDT / Updated: Aug 11, 2020 / 09:59 PM CDT.  CHICAGO — At least seven tornadoes touched down across Chicago area as a strong “derecho” storm system crossed the region Monday night, including one that passed through Chicago’s city limits, according to the National Weather Service..  A long-lived thunderstorm complex, which originated along the Nebraska/South Dakota border, produced widespread severe wind damage across northern Illinois and Indiana Monday afternoon. Straight line winds of 60-80 mph were common..  Investigations by the NWS on Tuesday confirmed both an EF-0 and a EF-1 tornado touched down outside Rockford Monday night, as well as EF-1 tornadoes in Spring Grove, Marengo, Wheaton, Lombard and Rogers Park..  According to the NWS, several tornadic circulations developed within the main line of thunderstorms in the “derecho” system, producing conditions that led to high winds and caused damage across parts of Chicago’s far North Side, the western suburbs and far northeast Illinois..  In the greater Chicago area, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power outages, and 3/4 inch to 1 inch diameter hail. Winds in Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood reached 85 mph, while wind speeds of 91 mph were reported in Cedar Point, and 72 mph near Midway Airport..  A supercell that was absorbed into the system also produced tornado damage in and around the Rockford area. The NWS said it’s possible they’ll confirm additional tornadoes in the coming days..  A tornado that touched down in Lincolnwood moved northeast through Chicago and Rogers Park with estimated peak winds of 110 mph and a maximum width of 300 yards..  Rogers Park resident Mary Hopkins said she had just got home from volunteering with the census when the tornado hit..  “I was heading toward the basement and got to the center of the house, and then this tree came down and the whole house shook; knocked the plaster off the wall, the crown molding upstairs, I was cowering in the doorway but it was over in a flash,” Hopkins said..  Storms left 500,000 people without power across the area, and ComEd says it will take several days to get everyone back online..  Chicago’s 311 call center reported 8,859 service requests for downed trees, traffic signal outages and storm-related damage, while 911 received 559 calls regarding downed wires as well.

641,"People in Illinois who have not yet filled out their census forms will soon get a knock at their door..  Workers with the U.S. Census Bureau start canvassing door-to-door on Tuesday in most of the state, after in-person follow-up started in parts of Chicago, Cook County, Peoria and Dekalb last month..  A little more than 30% of households in the state still need to fill out the population survey, which they can do online , by mail or over the phone..  Meanwhile, advocates for an accurate count are raising concerns after the bureau shortened the response timeframe..  “In many cases, it's up to five or six times that the Census Bureau provides for the opportunity for enumerators to go to these households,” said Anita Banerji, director of the Democracy Initiative at Forefront Illinois – a civic engagement non-profit. “By shortening the timeframe, we don't know that those five or six knocks will actually in fact occur.”.  Banerji said it’s particularly important for parts of the state where fewer people have responded..  “When we look at the rural part of our state, when we look at Hardin County, we look at Southern Illinois, we look at East St. Louis, these numbers still need to be increased,” she said. “And we really need that extra time to ensure that we are doing all that we can to get our communities counted.”.  After operations were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, the once-in-a-decade population count was supposed to wrap up at the end of October. The new deadline is the end of September..  Forefront Illinois and dozens of organizations and local governments wrote an open letter to Illinois’ Congressional delegation calling for the bureau to reconsider..  “As Census advocates, we are concerned that this shortened period will affect the Census count in communities across the State, particularly in historically undercounted communities,” the letter reads..  NPR reports the bureau changed the date because of pressure to meet the December 31 deadline to provide to the president population totals for Congressional reapportionment. The Census Bureau previously asked for an extension..  For in-person follow-up, census takers will wear masks and follow local public health guidelines, according to the Census Bureau. They’ll have a government ID badge with their photograph, a U.S. Department of Commerce watermark, and an expiration date..

642,"By Tron Griffin , today at 4:31 am A picture of the Chicago river..  I am a Midwestern guy all the way through to be honest. I would say there is nothing like living in the Midwest even if I get tired of the coldness of the winter months. Illinois is a good state, but we have problems ranging from violence to debt to population loss, which are problems many other states are suffering from as well..  In Illinois, over the last few years, there has been a lot of talk by Republicans living in the Central and Southern parts of the state that the state would be better off if Chicago and all of Cook County was its own state. I personally cannot understand why anyone would think getting rid of the only major city in the state would be a good idea, but the idea has a decent following..  There are people living in Central and Southern Illinois who actually believe the Republican nonsense that they are paying to keep Chicago running. They actually believe the lie that Chicago is running on their tax dollars despite the fact that Chicago is likely the only city in the state adding billions of the dollars to the state’s revenue. And for the record, Chicago is not receiving more money than it is putting in..  The problem with many cities and small towns in the lower parts of Illinois is the small town politics. I have a friend who was born and raised in a small town in Illinois. He would always say the people in his town complained about there not being much in the town and many blame Cook County for the problem since they have the power in Springfield. Those so-called big city loving Cook County politicians do not care about the small, rural, Central and Southern parts of Illinois. They are only looking out for Chicago and its surrounding suburbs, which could be true for some Cook County politicians..  My friend who grew up in a small town in Illinois said the town's problem was because it was run like many small towns in Illinois. At one point Walmart wanted to build a location and I believe a distribution center in his town, but the local politicians voted down the plan. One reason is because his town was run like many small towns where the local store owners and one or two families controlled everything. A Walmart location could have put their small stores out of business or reduced their customers. So they chose to stop Walmart and other stores from coming to town while at the same time blaming the Cook County politicians in Springfield for not helping their town bring jobs to the community..  One of the biggest problems with Illinois in my opinion is the fact that our state does not have a second major city. In the Midwest, Missouri has St. Louis and Kansas City; Wisconsin has Milwaukee and Madison; Ohio has Cleveland and Cincinnati. I bet the average person outside of Illinois could not name another Illinois city outside of Chicago. Those who could probably would likely name a city in the Chicago suburbs or Champaign where the Illinois Fighting Illini plays..  The Central and Southern parts of Illinois want to blame Cook County for their problems when they should be asking why people do not want to live there. Chicago is the city that drives the Chicagoland area. People are attracted to major cities because of the employment opportunities, entertainment, night and social life..  Central and Southern Illinois needs a major city that could bring in companies and tourism dollars. A major city in Central or Southern Illinois would help many of the surrounding suburbs while adding much-needed funds to the state’s budget, but more importantly, the major city would likely lead to an increase population and more representation in Springfield..  Now, when I say a major city, I am not saying the state of Illinois needs another top 10 or even top 20 populated city. We need a Milwaukee, St. Louis, Kansas City or Madison. A city that is nationally known and can be the engine that drives its surrounding suburbs..  Our nearby neighbor, Milwaukee, is a city that is in the midst of a building boom . Many in Milwaukee will tell you that downtown Milwaukee today is much different from its downtown twenty or even ten years ago. Give credit to the local politicians in the city because they are finding a way to compete with other Midwest cities for conventions and national events. Hopefully, the city will focus some of that new growth in the low-income communities of the city, which is something many African American and other community leaders have lobbied for in recent months..  For those who would say Milwaukee has been a major city for decades and that is slightly true. I would say Milwaukee has been a lesser known Midwest city in the shadow of other Midwest cities like our city, Detroit, Minneapolis, St. Louis and even Kansas City. Today, Milwaukee is not on an even ground with our city or even Minneapolis or Detroit, but the city is now competing with St. Louis, Kansas City and Indianapolis. Central and Southern Illinois could learn something from Milwaukee..

643,"Her name was Bernadette; I know her last name but ""history is personal"". She is not a direct ancestor, but a Great-Aunt..  Here is how the story goes: my Grandfather (Father's Father) was the youngest in a long line of probably adorable Sicilian children near the town of Termini-Immerse; he was born in 1885. Soon after, some of the family decided to make the move to America. Many Sicilian people from this region settled in Chicago; our family may have had friends and relations already here at that time..  Specifically, my toddler Grandfather's already grown and married sister--Bernadette, here--and her husband and maybe some kids? I don't know if his elderly parents made the trip. I don't know if both were alive. But somehow, someone or everyone thought it would be a good idea to take little Salvatore along to America. His parents were old--who was going to care for him? Other siblings? Why leave him in poor Sicily?.  They arrived before Ellis Island processed immigrants. They arrived before the 1890 Census (the lost Census: burned in a fire) So it is difficult to track the family until the 1900 Census..  Did the parents come to America? Someone in the family said there is record of an unmarked grave of an elderly ""Anna"", somewhere in a cemetery in the western suburbs of Chicago. I have heard there was a cholera infestation in Chicago in the 1890's that killed the parents?.  How many thousands of immigrants have experienced events like this? Handing off your last, toddler son to his older sister to take and raise in a distant land--a cold land? I have no idea who these extended generations of Sicilian people were; likely I never will..  Dad always assumed his Father was Italian; but when I learned that Sicily is a kind of ""pan-Mediterranean/North African"" island, I bought Dad an early DNA test several years before he passed away. It turned out that his paternal DNA had many geographic ""clusters"" on the map of Spain, around Santander. He was shocked and a little affronted to learn of these Spanish ties. Spain controlled Sicily for centuries--with military forces..  So for now, Bernadette is the ""dead end"" or ""wall"" that I have hit on this branch of the family. Most we can trace: I have two other mysterious dead ends: both on my Mother's side. Other stories for other nights.

646,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Postal workers in Illinois are among those calling for swift action by Congress to save the U.S. Postal Service. Jackie Engelhart, president of Northwest Illinois Area Local (NWIAL) 194 of the American Postal Workers Union (APWU), says postal workers have been crucial in serving the public during the COVID-19 crisis -- delivering absentee ballots, medical supplies and other necessities to people sheltering in place. However, she explains, mail volume is down 50%, which could have a major impact on revenues. ""The only thing that's really continuing to come in is mainly the parcels, so the post office is caught in between a double whammy, as far as a loss of volume and increased expenses for dealing with keeping the employees safe,"" she points out. The APWU is calling on Congress to provide one-time funding of at least $25 billion to cover immediate revenue loss, as well as ongoing support for the duration of the crisis. The Postal Service has been left out of federal COVID-19 financial relief, while private corporate and other business interests have received almost $1 trillion in assistance. By some estimates, the Postal Service could run out of money by the end of summer. Engelhart says should the Post Service collapse, rural customers would have to rely on private shipping companies that don't have as much infrastructure in smaller communities. ""Right now, the Postal Service is obviously mandated to serve every mailbox in the United States,"" she states. ""But what would happen if there was no post office, and that mandate went away? I have no idea. There probably isn't much of a plan, except to sell the profitable part."" President Donald Trump and some Republicans have questioned the sustainability of the Postal Service, and have at times called for it to be privatized.

647,"Series: Coronavirus Is the United States Prepared for COVID-19?.  ProPublica Illinois is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to get weekly updates about our work..  Asiaha Butler was disturbed when coronavirus cases started to climb in her neighborhood, but she wasn’t surprised. A longtime housing advocate in Englewood, she knew the area was at high risk, even though it’s sparsely populated. Vacant lots and empty houses dot the neighborhood, leaving homes spaced farther from one another than in other parts of the city..  “People I talk to say, ‘Well, Englewood looks no different after the shelter-in-place order,’” said Butler, executive director of the Resident Association of Greater Englewood, or RAGE. “It’s always very isolated. There’s always tons of land. ... But I knew from so many reports and from the work that we do that we would be hit hard.”.  In Chicago, low-density areas like Englewood, which has fewer households per square mile than most other neighborhoods, are seeing some of the highest infection rates, according to early data released by the Illinois Department of Public Health. In many of these areas, the majority of residents are African American or Hispanic..  Help Us Report on Coronavirus Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert? Help make sure our journalism is responsible and focused on the right issues..  Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick..  The high infection rates in these low-density areas run counter to a common assumption that cities are epicenters of coronavirus outbreaks primarily because their residents live close to one another..  A ProPublica Illinois analysis found that crowded conditions within homes, rather than housing density, may better explain why some areas of Chicago see higher infection rates..  One of the highest infection rates in Chicago is in the 60636 ZIP code, a predominantly African American part of the South Side that includes much of West Englewood. As of Wednesday, the ZIP code had about 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases for every 1,000 residents. Yet the area is one of the most sparsely populated in the city, with only about 2,800 households per square mile, according to the U.S. census..  In contrast, the 60657 ZIP code, centered in the mostly white and affluent Lakeview neighborhood on the North Side, has had just three COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents, though it is particularly dense, with 16,000 households per square mile..  Unlike density, which is a measure of how close people’s homes are to one another, crowding measures how many households have more occupants than rooms (excluding bathrooms). A neighborhood with higher crowding rates is more likely to include people who can’t avoid close contact with an infected person who lives with them..

Asiaha Butler was disturbed when coronavirus cases started to climb in her neighborhood, but she wasn’t surprised. A longtime housing advocate in Englewood, she knew the area was at high risk, even though it’s sparsely populated. Vacant lots and empty houses dot the neighborhood, leaving homes spaced farther from one another than in other parts of the city..  “People I talk to say, ‘Well, Englewood looks no different after the shelter-in-place order,’” said Butler, executive director of the Resident Association of Greater Englewood, or RAGE. “It’s always very isolated. There’s always tons of land. ... But I knew from so many reports and from the work that we do that we would be hit hard.”.  In Chicago, low-density areas like Englewood, which has fewer households per square mile than most other neighborhoods, are seeing some of the highest infection rates, according to early data released by the Illinois Department of Public Health. In many of these areas, the majority of residents are African American or Hispanic..  Help Us Report on Coronavirus Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert? Help make sure our journalism is responsible and focused on the right issues..  Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick..  The high infection rates in these low-density areas run counter to a common assumption that cities are epicenters of coronavirus outbreaks primarily because their residents live close to one another..  A ProPublica Illinois analysis found that crowded conditions within homes, rather than housing density, may better explain why some areas of Chicago see higher infection rates..  One of the highest infection rates in Chicago is in the 60636 ZIP code, a predominantly African American part of the South Side that includes much of West Englewood. As of Wednesday, the ZIP code had about 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases for every 1,000 residents. Yet the area is one of the most sparsely populated in the city, with only about 2,800 households per square mile, according to the U.S. census..  In contrast, the 60657 ZIP code, centered in the mostly white and affluent Lakeview neighborhood on the North Side, has had just three COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents, though it is particularly dense, with 16,000 households per square mile..  Unlike density, which is a measure of how close people’s homes are to one another, crowding measures how many households have more occupants than rooms (excluding bathrooms). A neighborhood with higher crowding rates is more likely to include people who can’t avoid close contact with an infected person who lives with them..

649,"Without action, the next decade of political districts could be determined by picking a name out of a hat.  Chicago, IL-(ENEWSPF)- Illinois legislators and ethical government activists from communities across Illinois continue their outreach and support for Fair Maps and an improved redistricting process as the May 3rd deadline approaches. After May 3rd, the process becomes very uncertain, and urgent legislative action will be required to prevent another decade of partisan gerrymandered maps..  While many might have assumed Democrats will retain their partisan control of the map making process, that is no longer a safe assumption. Due to potential delays in the Census due to COVID-19, there is a 50 percent chance that Republicans actually will be in charge. “It could all come down to which name is drawn out of a hat,” says Ryan Tolley, policy director for CHANGE Illinois, the non-partisan coalition supporting the Fair Maps Amendment. “Lawmakers are running out of time to take action. Our democracy deserves a vote on a more equitable map process, and if one cannot safely be held before the May 3rd deadline, then legislators must commit to meaningful reforms in the coming months.”.  There has been strong bipartisan support for the Fair Maps Amendment, which was introduced in the General Assembly on Feb. 13. The amendment is supported by 34 diverse organizations representing communities of color, businesses, farmers, senior citizens and more from across the state. A February poll commissioned by CHANGE Illinois showed 75 percent of the state’s voters support the creation of an independent commission to draw political maps..  Even during this pandemic, the supporters of this amendment are still committed to increasing election fairness. “This public health crisis underscores how important it is to elect leaders who are accountable to the people they serve,” said state Rep. Terra Costa Howard (D-Glen Ellyn), who is the Amendment’s chief sponsor in the House. “Now more than ever, we need to ensure that our districts are drawn fairly so that all constituents’ voices are heard.”.  “Illinoisans deserve better than a repeat of the same political map-making process that determined voters’ representation for decades, rather than allowing voters to choose their elected officials,” says state Rep. Ryan Spain of Peoria, the Republican chief co-sponsor of the Fair Maps Amendment. “We’re going to continue fighting for these reforms.”.  eNews Park Forest endorses this movement, fair maps, an end to gerrymandering in Illinois..

650,".  About three months ago, we received a unique phone call at the Reference Desk. Maurice Huffman was calling from his father’s residence in Florida. He had discovered that his father had a number of Chicago phone books and wondered if we were interested in adding them to our collection..  His father was born in Chicago and eventually moved to Florida but he never forgot his hometown. He was a reader and had a deep interest in history. As a result, he collected a large amount of memorabilia–like these phone books–that spoke to his Chicago connection..  Over the past few years the library has obtained a few Chicago phone books from three different decades. To help make people aware of these additions, both the genealogy librarian and I wrote blog posts about this small collection. As a result, we have begun to see a response from the public who have called, emailed and stopped in to make use of these books. It was because of these blog posts that Mr. Huffman tracked us down..  Our phone books help searchers to confirm the location of a person or a business. But, most of all they work as a way for genealogists to place a family member’s residence between the years of the census. Ten years can be a long time to expect that people will stay in one place. So, if, for instance, their ancestor is listed in the 1930 census in Chicago but not the 1940 census, a phone book from 1944 might give the searcher a better idea when they left the city..  With these additions from James Huffman, compliments of his son, we have added additional years–and decades–to our collection. Plus, they sent a small collection of yellow pages too. The years we have now include:.  Chicago White Pages.  1919.  1927.  1936.  1941.  1944.  1948.  1949.  1953.  1957.  Chicago Classified Yellow Pages.  1936.  1950.  1959.  1964.  Many of these phone books are fragile so they are not able to be photocopied or scanned. However, we can provide photos, compliments of the tablet at the Reference Desk. These photos can be emailed to you..  In addition, you might be interested to know that we also have:.  Chicago Suburban.  1936.  1958-59.  And, to keep it more local:.  Chicago Suburban North/Northwest.  1961-62.  1964-65.  Bartlett, Roselle and Bloomingdale.  1953.  1956.  1957.  1958.  1959.  Schaumburg/Hoffman Estates.  1982-present*.  So, if you’re tracking down a person or a business in the Chicago area, don’t hesitate to contact me at jrozek@stdl.org or the Reference Desk at refdesk@stdl.org..

653,"Download Wirepoints’ accompanying handout: “Chicago’s Financial Crisis”.  Today, we are here to talk about the city’s 2020 budget, but I’d argue that’s the wrong way to look at this crisis..  It seems to me that everybody, every year, treats the city’s one-year budget deficits as if that’s the real issue. As if that’s the real problem that needs to be solved. In fact, everybody breathed a sigh of relief when Mayor Lightfoot didn’t resort to a property tax hike to close the gap. That shouldn’t have been the big achievement..  That’s the problem. By focusing on-one year budgets, it’s like we’re treating an intensive care patient with aspirin. Chicago’s problems are far larger than a one-year deficit. Its problems are multi-year, multi-government and structural..  When you add them all up, Chicago’s problems make it an extreme outlier nationally. Chicago households are burdened with far more debt than any other major city in the country..  The city’s credit rating sits alone with Detroit at junk. CPS is even worse than Detroit..  Chicago is also an outlier among the big cities in its population drop – nobody else has lost people four years in a row..  And property values, in real terms, are worth less today than they were in 2000. Chicago’s growth drags far below that of other big cities..  Focusing on one-year budgets only perpetuates those problems..  Our position at Wirepoints is that Chicagoans are stuck with more retirement debts than they can ever repay. Add up the debt of overlapping governments and put that burden on those households with the means to pay – say those making $75,000 or more – and you’re looking at a burden of $400,000 per household. That’s an impossible amount..  That burden will force more Chicagoans to flee, joining the 200,000 residents who already left between 2000 and 2010. And the city’s downward spiral will continue..  Chicago is in a mess because its politicians have failed to attack the city’s long-term problems: the cumulative, overlapping debts and the collective bargaining laws that end up inflating those debts year after year..  That’s why we’ve got to stop looking at these problems on a short-term, piecemeal basis. Because when we do it that way, one government in isolation, it allows lawmakers to get away with things that make no sense..  How else do you explain Mayor Lightfoot going to Gov. Pritzker to ask for a state takeover of city pensions, and then right after that, she offers what she calls the most lucrative contract in the CTU’s history?.  If you are an ordinary Chicagoan, that doesn’t make any sense. And it shouldn’t. But it’s the system that we have. It enables the bad behavior by both politicians and the unions..  Every year it’s the same thing. Politicians try to put a patch on something that’s fundamentally broken..  But if they were to try and do things right, Mayor Lightfoot would change course and put together a workout team – a restructuring group – that determines how to reduce Chicago’s debts so that the city can become competitive again in taxation, services, and its economic environment..  She’d also use the bully pulpit as mayor of the nation’s 3rd-biggest city to demand an amendment to the pension protection clause and a rollback in collective bargaining laws. After the strike, she may consider that..  What I’ve just said is unlikely, yes, but I’d argue entirely necessary. And inevitable. The alternative is collapse. And nobody wants that.","[0.5431113243103027, 0.45688867568969727]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5431113243103027

Rockford, Illinois – 18,789 Migrations.  Rockford, Illinois has definitely seen better days. The city first came to light in the 1830s and was built at the end of the Rock River. This position gave it a lot of success in terms of industrial development. They produced a ton of heavy machinery all the way until the latter half of the 20th century. That’s when Rockford’s struggle began..  kippy007 / Instagram.  According to local newspaper the Rockford Register Star, Rockford currently holds the highest unemployment rate in the state of Illinois. With that in mind, it is no surprise that the state’s third biggest city is steadily shrinking. According to census data, Rockford has seen 18,789 residents leave in the past decade and a population dive of 3.2%. 1. Chicago, Illinois – 296,320 Migrations.  While people from Indianapolis are reported to flock to Chicago, Windy City natives have respectively been packing up and leaving. According to census surveys, 296,320 people have fled the nation’s third-biggest city. Redfin has determined that most migrating population are leaving in favor of sunny Phoenix. We’re guessing that the warmer weather plays a huge part in that decision..  whoakimosabe / Instagram.  Reportedly, complaints amid Chicago residents span issues like the city’s high cost of living (with a median home value at $229,00), the education system, amenities and property tax.

655,"Illinois lawmakers’ approval of a Medicaid reimbursement increase for skilled nursing facilities earlier this year came as welcome news to providers in a state notorious for its difficult operating environment. But key definitions related to the requirements for staffing are still being finalized, and the ramifications for the funding boost are still unclear..  “The whole idea is to make sure there’s a Medicaid payment tied to mandatory staffing,” Matt Werner, a consultant who works with several different provider groups in the Land of Lincoln on Medicaid and other issues, told SNN..  As part of Illinois’s most recent budget, signed into law in June by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker , nursing operators are slated to get relief to the tune of $240 million in the next fiscal year. The state submitted a state plan amendment to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on August 23, and the government has 90 days to approve it, Werner noted. Advertisement.  The funding boost came with fines for operators that do not meet staffing mandates, and it’s those staffing increases that represent the next hurdle for providers. Specifically, it’s the breakdown between basic and skilled care that represents the next front for SNFs in Illinois, according to Werner..  The $240 million can be broken down into “two main buckets,” Illinois Health Care Association executive director Matt Hartman explained. The portion of funding most closely associated with staffing was $70 million — based on a direct add-on of $4.55 per patient per day to a given facility’s nursing rate. To receive it, the SNF must meet the staffing needs of the residents, he explained..  “With that, you have to have a plan of staffing you submit to the [Illinois] Department of Healthcare and Family Services (DHFS),” Hartman said. “If you fail to meet the particulars of the plan, the $4.55 will be stopped.”.  Illinois nursing facilities must set up a baseline comparison of actual staffing to the required staffing levels using data from the quarter ending June 30 of this year, according to a document from DHFS dated September 26. Operators must include targeted quarterly incremental increases for staffing, toward their required minimum staffing levels, and submit quarterly reports on their progress..  “Compliance on a quarterly basis will be determined based upon whether the actual staffing level for the quarter meets or exceeds the facility’s goal for the quarter,” the document reads..  The actual staffing levels will draw from payroll-based journal (PBJ) data each quarter, and if facilities don’t do what they said they would in terms of staffing for a quarter, they’ll lose the nursing rate..  That said, if facilities meet their staffing goal at the end of the year, they will receive the rate back. The DHFS has also said there will be no recoupment, Hartman note — meaning that if facilities don’t meet their staffing plans, they will stop receiving the increased rate but won’t have payments already made taken back..  But some specific details still need to be defined. Statutory language requires that nursing facility census data be self-reported, submitted quarterly, and “broken down by intermediate and skilled care,” according to the DHFS document..  Those terms still need to be defined, Hartman said, since the $4.55 add-on is predicated on the definition of a resident needing skilled care or intermediate care. The document from DHFS notes that intermediate care and skilled care do have specific meanings — but they have to be “further refined in metrics that can be identified and measured objectively.”.  They’re also important because the definitions will drive how SNFs are penalized by the Department of Health if they don’t staff properly – as opposed to simply not meeting their staffing plans..  “Depending on how the money flows, it could be eaten up in penalties,” Hartman said..  The rest of the funding increase that takes effect next fiscal year, the remaining $170 million, is linked to updating the support rate, which covers general service and administrative costs— food, laundry, utilities, maintenance, and others — for providing resident care. This rate, and others, were years out of date , according to a report from the nursing home advocacy group Health Care Council of Illinois (HCCI)..  According to that report, closures in the state were accelerating due to insufficient Medicaid rates, with three shutting down just this year. And for one operator, the closure wasn’t enough to stave off bankruptcy . Share","[0.504629373550415, 0.4953705966472626]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.504629373550415
656,"PEORIA — Residents in a small village in central Illinois awoke earlier this week to find an unwelcome exhortation in their yards:.  Join the Ku Klux Klan..  A pamphlet that promoted the white-supremacist hate group was encased in a small clear-plastic bag, weighted by rocks and deposited on at least five properties in Dalzell, a community of about 700 people located about 75 miles south of Rockford. Residents in several other communities located along Interstate 39 in central Illinois also had the KKK propaganda thrown in their yards..  Mark Manicki, the Dalzell police chief, said he woke up Sunday morning to messages and phone calls that reported the deliveries..  Manicki posted a photograph of the KKK packages on the police department's Facebook page, with a request for residents to alert him if they found one..  ""The people I've talked to are upset about it,"" said Manicki, who doesn't know who's responsible..  The pamphlet features a drawing of a white-hooded and robed KKK member and a membership request from something called the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan..  Also listed were a web address and a telephone number with a North Carolina-based area code. A call to the number revealed a recording of a man who asked interested parties to leave a message..  ""Greetings from the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. If you're white and proud, join the crowd,"" the man said..  Manicki said this is the first time he can recall such literature being distributed in Dalzell. According to recent U.S. Census figures, about 3% of the village's residents are African American..  ""Is the KKK in 2019 going to the point of recruiting people by driving around throwing pamphlets in yards with a rock at 12 at night?"" Manicki said. ""Could this be just a group of people that had nothing better to do on a Saturday night than drive around and get a stir out of people?.  ""We're a small town. We try to keep everybody in town feeling safe in their homes. We're not supposed to be dealing with stuff like this."".  Manicki said reports of similar packages were received in nearby Ladd and Spring Valley..  Farther south, El Paso Police Chief Dave Duncan said the pamphlets popped up about 10 days ago in his Woodford County city..  ""Same thing, literature with a rock in a baggie, just randomly,"" Duncan said..  The KKK propaganda also was found in Minonk. All the reported locations are near I-39..  The odiousness of the message doesn't necessarily represent a crime, according to Manicki..  It's possible such deliveries might violate trespassing or solicitation ordinances, but the chief acknowledged that's a stretch. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech..  ""Some people are like, 'Why are you investigating this?'"" he said. ""In law enforcement, we deal with things on a daily basis that have nothing to do with criminal activity. There doesn't have to be a crime to conduct an investigation..

Tweet Chicago Census office to hire Arabic partner for Census The U.S. Census through its Chicago Regional office is looking to hire an “Arabic partner” for the next two years as the agency begins preparations to conduct the 2020 Census. Although the U.S. Government has rejected adding the category of “Arab” or “Middle East or North Africa” (MENA) to the Census long forms, the hiring suggests the issue remains on the table. Although the hiring of one person for the spot won’t result in Arabs being fairly counter in the next Census, it means that the Census is keenly aware of the importance of the Arab community, which has been severely undercounted over the years.

659,"News Release Information.  19-1672-CHI.  Friday, November 01, 2019.  Households in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI metropolitan area spent an average of $63,726 per year in 2017-18, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Assistant Commissioner for Regional Operations Charlene Peiffer noted that this figure was significantly higher than the $60,580 average expenditure level for households in the United States. Chicago-area households allocated their dollars similarly to the nation in five of the eight major expenditure categories, with three differing significantly from their respective U.S. averages. For example, the share of expenditures for housing, which accounted for 35.3 percent of the average household's budget in the Chicago area, was significantly higher than the national average of 33.0 percent. (See chart 1 and table 1 .).  Highlights of the Chicago-area's 2017-18 spending patterns:.  Housing: This was the largest expenditure category for Chicago-area households and averaged $22,501. Housing accounted for 35.3 percent of the area's household budget, significantly higher than the 33.0-percent U.S. average. (See table 1 .) Among the 22 metropolitan areas nationwide for which data were available, Chicago was 1 of 9 areas to have a housing expenditure share that was higher than the national average. Housing expenditure shares among the 22 published metropolitan areas ranged from 39.4 percent in San Francisco to 30.1 percent in Detroit. (See table 2 .).  Transportation: Chicago-area households spent 13.2 percent of their budget on transportation, significantly lower than the national average of 16.0 percent. Of the $8,443 in annual transportation expenditures in Chicago, 88.7 percent was spent buying and maintaining private vehicles; this compared to the national average of 92.1 percent..  Food: The portion of a Chicago household's budget spent on food, 13.3 percent, was not significantly different from the 12.9-percent U.S. average. Chicago-area households spent $4,761, or 56.1 percent, of their food dollars on food at home and $3,720 (43.9 percent) on food away from home. In comparison, the average U.S. household spent 56.4 percent of its food budget on food at home and 43.6 percent on food away from home..  Additional Information.  Data in this release are from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE), which the U.S. Census Bureau conducts for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data in this release were averaged over a 2-year period, 2017 and 2018..  A household in the CE survey is defined as a consumer unit which includes families, single persons living alone or sharing a household with others but who are financially independent, or two or more persons living together who share expenses. The terms household or consumer unit are used interchangeably for convenience..  Differences in spending among metropolitan areas may reflect differences in the cost of living, but they also may reflect other causes. Spending differences may result from different consumer preferences or variations in demographic characteristics, such as household size, age, or income levels. However, expenditure shares, or the percentage of a household's budget spent on a particular category, can be used to compare spending patterns across areas. Sample sizes for the metropolitan areas are much smaller than for the nation, so the U.S. estimates and year-to-year changes are more reliable than those for the metropolitan areas. Users should also keep in mind that prices for many goods and services have changed since the survey was conducted..  A value that is statistically different from another does not necessarily mean that the difference has economic or practical significance. Statistical significance is concerned with our ability to make confident statements about a universe based on a sample. A large difference between two values may not be statistically significant, while a small difference could be significant; both the sample size and the variation among the values in the sample affect the relative error of the estimates..  For additional technical and related information, see www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cex/home.htm . Data for the nation, the four geographic regions of the U.S., and 22 metropolitan areas nationwide are available at www.bls.gov/cex/tables.htm . Metropolitan definitions used in the survey are available at www.bls.gov/cex/ce_msa_201516.htm . The metropolitan area discussed in this release is the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area, which comprises Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, and Will Counties in Illinois; Jasper, Lake, Newton, and Porter Counties in Indiana; and Kenosha County in Wisconsin.

If not, officials say you can expect a census worker to come to your door between May and July next year.""A large piece of the work until March is about marketing, getting people to know about the census, what is the census,"" Alvarez said.This is the first census where technology will play a much bigger role. Alvarez said he is working on ways to use smart phones to spread the word about the census.

The Census Bureau conducts a survey every month that includes questions about why a person changed residences in the previous year. The survey offers a range of possible answers, from foreclosure/eviction to change of climate to “wanted better neighborhood/less crime.”.

676,"Chicago may be in a fix when it comes to flex office.  November 5, 2019 |.  Despite the recent struggles of a certain juggernaut provider, all expectations are that the coworking and flexible office segment will only flourish in the U.S. over the next decade. Some cities will see larger growth than others, however, and Chicago might not match the rate of expansion in other markets..  According to research by JLL , flexible office occupancy has grown an average of 23 percent each year since 2010. Last year alone, the sector accounted for nearly two-thirds of the country’s office market occupancy gains..  Despite this progress, flex space inventory currently accounts for less than 5 percent of U.S. office stock. JLL projects this segment of the office sector will advance from skyrocketing to meteoric, as it consumes up to a 30 percent share of the market by 2030..  The flexible office phenomenon.  Employees, startups and independent contractors obviously gravitate to coworking spaces, but they also make sense at the enterprise level. The main driver here is that these spaces offer lease flexibility..  “If a building has some flexibility options, it’s really enticing for occupiers,” said Emily Watkins, managing director, flexible space solutions, JLL Americas. “It allows them to perhaps take a little bit less space and feel comfortable that they can sign a more traditional lease for a longer period of time because they know that they will have the ability to flex up or down if needed.”.  There’s so much promise of expansion that some ownership groups have opted to cut out the middleman, crafting their own coworking spaces. Tishman Speyer , for example, launched Studio last year. The landlord operates one Chicago Studio coworking space at the Franklin Center in the Loop, where rates start at $350 per month for a flex desk. And they’re not alone..  “A lot of the thought leadership is seeing this as the next frontier in shared spaces,” said Watkins. “We do see a lot of people doing it themselves because they feel that it creates flexibility within an asset.”.  These owner-provided coworking options dovetail with how office building amenity suites have evolved in recent years. On-site gyms and cafeterias are great, but when properties started offering rentable conference spaces, that impacted the tenants’ bottom line as they didn’t have to make room in their lease for, what is for some, a seldom-used asset. The inclusion of coworking space is just an extension of that..  “A lot of asset owners are looking at their entire building and how they can provide more flexible solutions, more amenity spaces that can drive a better experience and help that occupier with solutions related to flexibility,” Watkins said..  Toward 2030.  According to the JLL research, there’s not a single U.S. market where flexible office space is currently oversaturated. That said, some are better positioned to see rapid growth. JLL identified 15 markets the greatest potential for growth within the sector. New York, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, Austin and Boston rounded out the top five; Chicago didn’t make the cut for the top 15..  According to Scott Homa, senior vice president and director of office research at JLL, there are several reasons why Chicago didn’t crack the top 15 markets. For one, Chicago already has a high share of existing flexible inventory. WeWork is currently the largest non-governmental office occupier in the Chicago CBD (though this may change depending on the mercurial company’s future prospects)..  Homa also points to a declining regional population. From 2010 to the present, Chicago’s population has flatlined, growing a meager 0.8 percent, while Illinois as a whole lost residents. Compare that to the population growth in markets like Austin (23.3 percent), Raleigh-Durham (18.1 percent) and Orlando (17.6 percent)..  The main drivers for that population loss—the city and state’s high taxes and budget deficits—are further reasons that some providers are slightly bearish on Chicago. Pricing is another factor. Chicago can be a money-losing market for coworking due to comparatively low-priced direct space, as well as a high cost of construction..  “In Chicago, construction costs are still relatively high, so the ability to commit to something long term is a little bit more palatable if you’re building out your own space,” Watkins said..  So what does the future of coworking look like, in Chicago and nationally? First is excising the notion of “coworking” only, as these spaces truly are flexible..  “When a lot of people think of flexible space, they immediately think of coworking, but that is just one piece of the solution for companies who are looking to implement flexible space—both for occupiers as well as investors,” Watkins said. “As these different models have started to become more prevalent, there has been more education and perspective about how flexibility can be applied to portfolios.”.  There may also be more collaborations between flexible office providers and non-office assets. Convene recently partnered with For Five Coffee Roasters to introduce a flagship café at their 311 W. Monroe Street location. “I think there’s a lot of interest in that because of the experience that you’re driving for the consumer,” said Watkins..  While Chicago may not be as competitive as other markets when it comes to growth in the flexible office segment, the sector will still see progression here. Flex space currently makes up 2.1 percent of Chicago’s office inventory; if the market only expands at half the rate that JLL predicts over the next ten years, that’s still a significant step forward. tags","[0.5064474940299988, 0.49355244636535645]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5064474940299988

The man reportedly pulled himself into a tree while trying to escape a dog when his knee became stuck and cut off the circulation. The unidentified victim could not feel anything from the knee down..  A woman found the 38-year-old, who was not wearing a coat and was about 4 feet off the ground, around 6:45 a.m. and contacted first responders..  “Due to the fact there was no circulation from the knee down, the decision was made not to free him from the tree until he could be transported immediately to surgery in order to try and save as much of the leg as possible. A battery-operated rescue tool spreader that we use on car accidents was used and required the tree to be spread 4 inches to remove his knee,” the fire department posted on Facebook, reports KMOV ..  After being rescued, the man was airlifted to a St. Louis hospital for treatment. Authorities said the man could lose his leg or foot as a result of the incident..

678,"While taxes imposed by municipalities and states are often debated on economic, efficiency or equitable grounds, the justice of taxation is rarely a subject for discussion. But we need to have that debate in Illinois, where our government has become predatory, perverse and unjust..  We believe government may justly compel a range of things, including taxation. The premise behind government of, by and for the people is that everyone is created equal and free, and that therefore just government does not rule, it serves; just government does not impoverish, it enriches..  So, taxation is just, even though compulsory, when imposed by an elected government pursuing common welfare. For example, we generally agree that taxes imposed for our common defense, to alleviate poverty or to enhance opportunities in the community are just because they create a better, stronger community for us all..  When is government unjust? When a strong few -- such as a king and his knights -- tax to enrich themselves, or when a government does the opposite of what it should do, such as taking something from the community, piling up what has been taken and burning it..  Predatory governments serve themselves, not the community as a whole, and perverse governments impoverish the community instead of enriching it..  Which brings us to Illinois..  Illinois is the least tax-friendly state in the nation, according to both Kiplinger’s and WalletHub, and so Illinois’ population shrinks while population in neighboring states grows. As people leave or decide not to come, property values fall; WirePoints estimates that Chicagoland homeowners lost more than $250 billion in recent years. This massive loss in property values not only dwarfs the revenue Illinois and its municipalities collect each year, it’s greater than some measures of our unfunded pension debt. However, no one benefits from this property loss -- it’s as if the government took a portion of each resident’s wealth, piled it up and burned it..  Residents of Illinois do not receive better government services for their higher taxes; they receive less and less because an extraordinary growing share of all government revenues are devoted to paying past promises to Illinois’ valuable government workers..  Government must offer competitive compensation to attract people who will provide excellent services to its communities. Taking care of government employees is necessary for any government to function. However, generations of politicians didn’t actually put up the money to pay for their generous promises. As a result, funding those pension promises is becoming a core purpose of Illinois’ government and the obsession of its leadership, making our government both predatory and perverse..  As Illinois keeps increasing taxes on middle-income Anne (who has no pension) to pay ever greater pension benefits to government worker Jay, not only is Anne paying more for the same or less service, but the value of Anne’s house and nest egg for her own retirement falls too.

Predatory governments serve themselves, not the community as a whole, and perverse governments impoverish the community instead of enriching it..  Which brings us to Illinois..  Illinois is the least tax-friendly state in the nation, according to both Kiplinger’s and WalletHub, and so Illinois’ population shrinks while population in neighboring states grows.

However, no one benefits from this property loss -- it’s as if the government took a portion of each resident’s wealth, piled it up and burned it..  Residents of Illinois do not receive better government services for their higher taxes; they receive less and less because an extraordinary growing share of all government revenues are devoted to paying past promises to Illinois’ valuable government workers..  Government must offer competitive compensation to attract people who will provide excellent services to its communities. Taking care of government employees is necessary for any government to function. However, generations of politicians didn’t actually put up the money to pay for their generous promises. As a result, funding those pension promises is becoming a core purpose of Illinois’ government and the obsession of its leadership, making our government both predatory and perverse..

682,".  Can philanthropic giving be focused to combat the racial wealth gap? The Chicago Community Trust , at 104 years old the 4th oldest community foundation around, is going to try. Jennifer Axelrod of the Trust's new learning and impact division presented a sneak preview last week at Loyola University's Center for Urban Research and Learning ..  Source: Lumen Learning.  The Trust recently adopted a new vision statement pointing towards ""a thriving, equitable and connected Chicago region where people of all races, places and identities have the opportunity to reach their potential."" While they work with a variety of donors and causes, Axelrod says they hope to ""draw them towards"" addressing the racial wealth gap, because it is at the root of so many of the social ills they combat..  Race by census tract, Chicago (Source; Folded Map Project) Axelrod cited a 2017 study by the Metropolitan Planning Council concluding that Chicago's economic growth would be 2.5 percentage points higher if the metropolitan area were less segregated. Nationally, median family wealth for whites is ten times that of blacks, eight times that of Latinx; according to the Federal Reserve Board whites held 89 percent of the $87 trillion of wealth in the United States, compared to 3 percent each for blacks and Latinx. [I know it's greater than that in Washington, D.C. , and probably is less here in Iowa, where we have lower incidence of great wealth.] There were a lot of data to show the connection between the racial wealth gap and myriad social problems:.  liquid asset poverty: 65 percent of black and Latinx Chicagoans are ""living on the financial edge"" i.e. would be below the poverty line if they lost three months' income, compared to 28 percent of whites Chicago people of color live in communities where more than 50 percent of debt is delinquent, 40 percent of loans are subprime, and 20 percent are unbanked. They are thus at the mercy of payday lenders , who charge average annual interest rates of 404 percent. people of color lag far behind whites on all kinds of assets, particularly homeownership, which is the most common source of individual wealth. 35 percent of black and 43 percent of Latinx Chicagoans own their own homes, compared to 54 percent of whites. Much of this is due to the legacy of contract buying in Chicago decades ago, which disproportionately affected blacks; because contract borrowers lose their entire equity when they miss a payment, this arrangement cost blacks as much as $4 billion in assets. people of color have differential health outcomes, too, particularly infant and breast cancer mortality Audience members added different parent-teacher interactions, food deserts (even comparing different stores in the same chain), school quality, access to public transit, and greater police presence . One community member plugged the Folded Map Project , where residents try to meet those with similar coordinates--in his case, 4900 N/S 9000 W--on opposite sides of the city..  Jennifer Axelrod and Dan Tollefson talk to audience members after the presentation The racial wealth gap originated in slavery, of course, but as horrible as that was, it has been exacerbated over the years by Jim Crow laws, redlining and exclusion from housing programs, and the decline of labor wages. Today, an American child's life prospects are heavily determined by the circumstances into which they are born, and to the extent that people of color are identified in the public mind with poverty and crime , the racial wealth gap gets replicated for each new generation. The case for reparations may rest on the history of slavery ( Myers 2019 ), but the urgency rests in injustices since then, and the inequalities they have perpetuated..  The CCT plans ""to engage donors more thoughtfully,"" with the intent of addressing critical needs (services as well as long-term systemic change), building coalitions and networks, and promoting community driven investment. Those are ambitious goals, as much at the engagement stage as at the more outcomes-based stages. (Are donors ready to be talked into this?) There is the ever-present danger of unintended consequences, such as when better transportation services facilitates displacement by gentrification. But if ten years from now they have helped achieve ""real integration,"" however incrementally, they'll have made yeomanlike contribution towards our common life..

683,"While Windy City children can finally start heading back to school, the Chicago Teachers Union’s (CTU) 11-day strike resulted in no reform, to the detriment of students, taxpayers, and the fiscal health of the entire state of Illinois..  With a median salary of $78,000, Chicago Public Schools (CPS) teachers make more than 60 percent of all Chicagoans with a college education. Compared to the nation’s 10 largest cities, the Illinois Policy Institute (IPI) found that CPS has the highest average salary, beating out school districts in cities like Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York City..  Originally, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot offered teachers a 16 percent pay raise that would increase their average salary to nearly $100,000 over five years, but CTU rejected the deal. The union had demanded at least a 15 percent salary bump over three years, along with a reduction in health insurance premiums..  On October 31, 2019, Mayor Lightfoot and CTU “ settled ” on a 16 percent pay raise over five years as well as several other costly concessions. The deal includes a 40 percent pay increase for teaching assistants, $35 million investment in reducing classroom size, and a particularly problematic decision that increases the amount of unused sick days that can be exchanged for pension credit from 40 to a whopping 244 days. According to IPI, the five-year contract will cost taxpayers roughly $627 million, with at least $114 million due in the first year. Even more ludicrous, some union members were unsatisfied with the more than half-billion-dollar agreement. The deal was tentatively confirmed by split decision, with some teachers demanding more funding..  While CTU argued for a salary bump, 361,314 students , 76.6 percent of which are low-income, were stuck at home. The strike not only hurt Chicago’s youth, who chronically underperform academically and have high rates of truancy and absence, but their parents as well. Many of these parents work and rely on their children being in school so they can make a living..  The strike also brought attention to the city’s looming pension debt. Currently, CPS’s pensions are only 48 percent funded and $11 billion in the hole. For fiscal year 2020, Chicago’s budget is $838 million in the red, including nearly $300 million owed to police and fire pension funds. By 2023, City Hall will need an additional $989 million annually to meet its obligations to retirees. Chicago’s total pension liabilities have grown to around $46 billion, which is higher than the unfunded retirement obligations in 44 states. Illinois has $134 billion in unfunded pensions, so it should come as no surprise that the state ranks dead last in the Mercatus Center’s 2018 State Fiscal Rankings and continually has one of the lowest credit ratings in the country..  Instead of getting at the root of the problem, the burden once again falls on the shoulders of Chicago’s taxpayers. Under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the city tried and failed to address the pension issue by enacting $864 million in new tax hikes, 63 percent from property taxes..  As a result of the massive pension debt and the crowding out of funds for other purposes, both Chicago and Illinois have seen a mass exodus of taxpaying citizens and businesses moving to neighboring states that have lower taxes and stable job growth. With Governor J. B. Pritzker pushing for a new graduated income tax that disproportionately affects middle-class workers, the city and state seem destined for a sixth consecutive year of population loss, intensifying the tax burden for those who remain..  There are practical solutions to fixing Chicago’s pension woes. IPI has proposed several structural reforms to the pensions system, including increasing the retirement age, adjusting automatic annual increases to inflation, and capping maximum pensionable salary. The Manhattan Institute suggests that a larger portion of the budget should go to teachers’ take-home pay and recommends a switch to a portable defined-contribution system..  Another solution to the pension problem is a constitutional amendment that would curb future retirement benefits. A 2015 Illinois Supreme Court decision determined that a government workers’ pension benefits cannot be changed. This severely restricts lawmakers’ ability to make financial reforms when needed. As explained by IPI, “the ‘earned, but not going forward’ standard strikes a suitable balance between providing states with needed financial flexibility while still guaranteeing that no government workers will lose benefits they had a reasonable expectation of receiving.” Since only future benefits can be modified, workers would not have to worry about the loss of previous benefits if they decided to change jobs or relocate. Reforming future pensions benefits has a track-record of success in states like Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Utah..  Chicago’s economy has promise. The city consistently ranks first among large cities for corporate expansion and Moody’s Analytics projects that Chicago “will continue to develop as the transportation and distribution center for the Midwest.” The best way to release this economic potential is by sticking to a budget and spending less, not by adding more to the city’s mountain of debt..  CTU’s strike has made a bad situation much worse for Chicago’s irresponsible and unsustainable pensions. Windy City lawmakers can no longer neglect this crisis and must push for solutions that bring costs into line with benefits, prioritize the city’s long-term fiscal health, and avoid further damaging tax hikes.

Over the course of nine months, Governor Pritzker and I have been hard at work to improve the lives of our Illinois veterans and their loved ones. From securing a $15 an hour minimum wage for working families in our state, ensuring there’s a balanced budget that funds services that our veterans and their loved ones depend on, to legalizing adult use of cannabis with the most equity-centric legislation in the country, and passing a capital plan that will invest in our infrastructure while creating thousands of jobs, and the establishment of the Justice, Equity and Opportunity Initiative (JEO) which is housed in my office..  The JEO will ensure that Illinois moves forward with a keener focus throughout state government about how a lack of opportunity and inequities can hurt families, and too often, are at the root of how people, including our veterans, enter the pipeline to our justice system..  We have learned that we cannot have real justice without addressing equity and opportunity. And, we can no longer afford to speak of justice solely in terms of policing and jails and prisons, but must talk about affordable housing, access to health care, and barriers to employment and a quality education..  There’s one more important way for us to secure maximum resources to our communities. That is by making sure that our communities participate in the 2020 Census. Governor Pritzker and I want to make sure that everyone in our state has fair and equal access to be counted as part of the 2020 census..  The census can determine how much money for critical services is distributed to communities in need. Nearly 42 percent of our state’s Black residents, 33 percent of our Latinx residents and 20 percent of children under the age of five live in hard-to-count communities. It is imperative and so critically important to our state that hard-to-count communities are reached. Failure to do so could be devastating for our communities in particular, but also devastating for our entire state..  For example, Illinois could lose $120 million in funding every year for missing just one percent of the population. That amounts to $1.2 billion dollars lost in over a decade. This is critical!.  Lastly, as the chair of the Illinois Council on Women and Girls, the Governor’s Rural Affairs Council, the Military Economic Development Council, the Illinois Rivers Coordinating Council and the Restore, Renew and Reinvest board – I am proud to serve our veterans and their loved ones in all the different ways that our state interacts with them.

Enrollment in Chicago Public Schools has shrunk further, down 1.7% this school year from the previous year. In all, the district lost 6,158 students, according to numbers released Friday..  But the year-over-year declines slowed considerably compared to past years, when annual drops topped 10,000 or more . The district credited higher numbers of students enrolling in pre-kindergarten and kindergarten..  The city still holds on to the title of the nation’s third largest school system, behind New York City and Los Angeles and ahead of Miami Dade, which also saw its student population decline this fall to 347,069..  Student enrollment counts are important, because they determine how much money the district gets from the state, and how much individual schools get from the district. At the school level, per-student funding determines how many teachers a principal can hire, whether or not there are librarians and arts teachers, and how many programs are offered. Loading....

692,"missing students Chicago reports another year of enrollment declines — but holds on to title of third-largest district in U.S. By Cassie Walker Burke - 1 day ago - Updated 1 day ago PHOTO: Stacey Rupolo/Chalkbeat Twitter.  Enrollment in Chicago Public Schools has shrunk further, down 1.7% this school year from the previous year. In all, the district lost 6,158 students, according to numbers released Friday..  But the year-over-year declines slowed considerably compared to past years, when annual drops topped 10,000 or more . The district credited higher numbers of students enrolling in pre-kindergarten and kindergarten..  The city still holds on to the title of the nation’s third largest school system, behind New York City and Los Angeles and ahead of Miami Dade, which also saw its student population decline this fall to 347,069..  Student enrollment counts are important, because they determine how much money the district gets from the state, and how much individual schools get from the district. At the school level, per-student funding determines how many teachers a principal can hire, whether or not there are librarians and arts teachers, and how many programs are offered. Loading....

Amr Alfiky/AP In 2018, the U.S. Census Bureau released figures showing the population of Illinois had declined for a fifth year in a row . The year before, it fell behind Pennsylvania as the nation’s fifth-largest state. The string of recent declines has generated considerable debate, with politicians frequently spinning it to buttress their own policy arguments. This summer, we rated False a claim in which a Republican state lawmaker said Illinois lost middle-class families after the state instituted its last income tax hike. And in years past, Democrats attacked former Gov. Bruce Rauner over the population loss that occurred under his watch. During a sit-down interview at FIA’s annual futures and options expo in Chicago, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker brought up the downward trend while highlighting the work his administration is doing to make higher education more affordable. “People talk about the exodus from Illinois, and they’ve blamed it on a lot of things, because we’ve lost population,” Pritzker said . “Illinois lost population in 94 out of the last 95 years, so it’s not like it’s a new thing that we have a slight out-trickle of people leaving the state. Nevertheless, I’d like to reverse it. And so, the best way to do that is actually to keep our students here and attract students to our universities.” Has Illinois, which is still the nation’s sixth-largest state, lost population almost every year for most of the past century? And what, exactly, does Pritzker mean by “lost population?” Mixed messages The first and most specific part of Pritzker’s claim is contradicted by annual population estimates maintained by the federal government. Illinois’ overall population has grown — not declined — in all but 15 of the past 95 years for which the U.S. Census Bureau has data. In 1924, Illinois’ population was 7.2 million, while in 2018, 12.7 million resided in the state. Figures for 2019 have not yet been released . So if population has gone up for most of the past century, what was Pritzker talking about? Chicago’s old South Water Street in 1924. File Photo. Sun-Times Archives We asked his spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh, who told us the governor wasn’t referring to total population but “net domestic migration,” which is a subset of overall population that measures the difference between the number of people who move into Illinois from another state versus those who move out of Illinois to other states. If more people leave Illinois than arrive from other states, it’s considered net domestic out-migration, a definition that jibes with the second half of Pritzker’s comment about a “slight out-trickle” of Illinois residents. And a 2016 report authored by some of the state’s most prominent tax policy experts suggest he’s correct that net domestic out-migration isn’t a new phenomenon. Aside from a small increase in 1947, the last time more people moved from other states into Illinois than out of it was 1920, according to the report, which drew on estimates compiled from multiple federal sources by migration expert Lyman Stone. “Illinois has reliably had negative net domestic migration for a century,” Stone told us in an email. That also tracks with an analysis of census population estimates conducted by Brookings Institution demographer William Frey in response to our inquiry. He found Illinois has experienced net domestic out-migration annually since 2000, the earliest year for which he had comparable data. While domestic out-migration has driven Illinois’ recent decline, however, Frey cautioned it’s still just one piece of the puzzle when looking at changes in population over time. It’s a metric that does not account for international migration, which Illinois and other large states such as New York and California have relied on for population gains. Nor does it include increases from the number of births that occur in a state. Our ruling Pritzker said “Illinois lost population in 94 out of the last 95 years, so it’s not like it’s a new thing that we have a slight out-trickle of people leaving the state.” The state saw declines in its overall population in just 15 of the last 95 years for which the federal government has released estimates, which contradicts part of the governor’s claim on its face. His office said he was only referencing domestic migration — the number of people moving to and from Illinois within the United States — and estimates compiled by migration experts suggest he’s on more solid ground there.

700,"Does it feel like you have more elbow room lately? If you live in Illinois, that’s not your imagination playing tricks on you. People are leaving the state faster than people are arriving from other states, and newborns are not emerging frequently enough to make up the difference..  In 2019, the U.S. Census Bureau calculates, our population fell by about 51,250 people. That’s the equivalent of everyone in Hoffman Estates packing up and heading out..  Advertisement While the Land of Lincoln is experiencing a net outflow, other states are people magnets. Texas added some 367,215 residents last year — an average of more than 1,000 people every day . Florida grew by 233,420; Arizona by 120,693. Some of the transplants came from metropolitan Chicago and elsewhere in Illinois..  It’s not just the weather that attracts new residents. Minnesota has a climate even more challenging than Illinois’ — but it added some 33,383 people last year..  If you like having slightly more breathing room in this state, you can be happy. If you like losing political power nationally, not so much..  Congressional seats are allocated to states based on how many inhabitants they have, as tabulated in the census every 10 years. As recently as the 1940s, Illinois had 27 U.S. House members. Today, it has just 18 — and commensurately less clout in Washington. After the 2020 census, it will have no more than 17, and could drop to 16. Texas, by contrast, could go from 36 to 38. Each state’s electoral votes in presidential elections will change accordingly..  That’s hardly the only downside for Illinois.

701,"Does it feel like you have more elbow room lately? If you live in Illinois, that’s not your imagination playing tricks on you. People are leaving the state faster than people are arriving from other states, and newborns are not emerging frequently enough to make up the difference..  In 2019, the U.S. Census Bureau calculates, our population fell by about 51,250 people. That’s the equivalent of everyone in Hoffman Estates packing up and heading out..  Advertisement While the Land of Lincoln is experiencing a net outflow, other states are people magnets. Texas added some 367,215 residents last year — an average of more than 1,000 people every day . Florida grew by 233,420; Arizona by 120,693. Some of the transplants came from metropolitan Chicago and elsewhere in Illinois..  It’s not just the weather that attracts new residents. Minnesota has a climate even more challenging than Illinois’ — but it added some 33,383 people last year..  If you like having slightly more breathing room in this state, you can be happy. If you like losing political power nationally, not so much..  Congressional seats are allocated to states based on how many inhabitants they have, as tabulated in the census every 10 years. As recently as the 1940s, Illinois had 27 U.S. House members. Today, it has just 18 — and commensurately less clout in Washington. After the 2020 census, it will have no more than 17, and could drop to 16. Texas, by contrast, could go from 36 to 38. Each state’s electoral votes in presidential elections will change accordingly..  That’s hardly the only downside for Illinois. Population loss means fewer taxpayers to cover the mountain of public pension obligations that are eating up so much of state and local budgets, and to fund public schools and universities, and to finance social welfare programs..

709,"As Illinois prepares for the 2020 census count, leaders of the state census office said they’re focusing on getting correct information out to communities, in particular clearing up confusion about job qualifications for census enumerators, the use of online forms and the timeline for the decennial count..  Other states, including Montana and Missouri, have been dealing with potentially misleading census forms sent out by the Republican National Committee, which solicit donations for President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, according to the Washington Post . Some Alabama voters got similar mailers, according to AL.com ..  Meanwhile, Facebook recently announced its social media sites would ban posts that attempt to interfere with the count..  Oswaldo Alvarez and Marishonta Wilkerson, directors of the Illinois Census Office, said they’re not aware of deliberate misinformation being spread in the state..  Illinois gave out tens of millions of dollars to groups to encourage census participation. Alvarez said the state has been working closely with them to make sure they all have the same information — and that the information is correct..  “[It’s about] giving them the consistent, the same information from the timeline to the number of questions, to tools on how to reduce people's fears,” he said..  Jay Young, director of Common Cause Illinois — a civic engagement nonprofit, agreed that’s important. Still, he warned just because the state office and advocates like him haven’t heard of misleading information floating around, it could still be out there..  “We have to make sure that folks remain vigilant and are aware of the good information,” he said..  The U.S. Census Bureau set up an email address, rumors@census.gov, for people to report questionable information..  Meanwhile, Young said groups that want to encourage participation can find resources on the bureau’s website , the state portal Illinois Count Me In , and a national collaborative called Census Counts ..  Points Of Confusion.  The two state census directors said they have gotten questions about other points of confusion around the population count set to start this year..  This includes questions on the American Community Survey, a more in-depth questionnaire that the U.S. Census Bureau sends out throughout the year..  “When it comes to specifically the immigrant communities, the American Community Survey does ask the question of citizenship, while the actual census form will not,” Alvarez said..  A U.S. Supreme Court decision ruled the question should be left off the 2020 form , after a request by the Trump administration to include it..  Alvarez said he wanted to be sure residents understand that they’ll get reminders to fill out the form online starting in March, but if they don’t respond by early April, they’ll also get paper copies to fill out..  After that attempt, census enumerators will attempt to count the household through personal visits in May..  Young said the best way to avoid a knock at the door is to fill out the census form online..  The Census Bureau is also hiring more than 18,000 enumerators to assist in the count in Illinois. The pay is between $17 and $29 per hour..  Wilkerson said for those receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, SNAP and other public benefits, income from census work will not affect their eligibility for those programs..  The count starts in January with people in nursing homes, college dorms and other group settings. Residents can expect their first invitation to fill out the census form online in March..  In addition to giving out millions to local groups, Illinois is hiring a marketing firm to do a statewide public education campaign on the 2020 census. Alvarez said he expects that to start in early 2020. Tags:","[0.6365793347358704, 0.36342066526412964]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6365793347358704
710,"It was a close competition between Indiana and Florida: Which state in 2018 attracted the most Illinois residents for relocation?.  Indiana won. Nearly 26,000 Illinois tax filers (including their dependents) moved to Indiana in 2018, new Internal Revenue Service data shows . Out with Chicago-style pizza and beef sandwiches. In with pork tenderloin and sugar cream pie, two Hoosier staples..  Advertisement But Florida beaches beckoned too. Nearly 24,000 Illinoisans moved to Florida in 2018. Some Indiana residents and Floridians moved to Illinois, mind you, but not enough to make up the difference. Texas was the third most popular destination for Illinoisans, followed by California, Wisconsin, Missouri and Arizona..  What do Indiana and Florida boast that Illinois does not? Lower taxes, well-funded pension systems, balanced budgets and, in Florida’s case, sunshine and ocean views. Who can compete with that? Uncle! Uncle!.  You’ve seen the numbers. U.S. census data released in December showed Illinois’ net population since 2013 has dropped by more than 223,000 residents, roughly the equivalent of Naperville and Bolingbrook wiped off the map. That number includes births, deaths, domestic and international migration..  The IRS numbers are a separate data set and a year behind the census calculations, but they also show the growing gap between people leaving Illinois and not enough domestic migration and new births to make up the difference. The U-Hauls are not headed this way. Gee. Wonder why..  What gets lost in the numbers is the ripple effect. Those 223,000 people won’t be paying taxes in Illinois — not income, sales, property, gasoline, alcohol, cigarette, cannabis, you name it. They won’t be buying homes or cars or groceries or home goods. They’re not raising kids here, buying school supplies or signing them up for sports.

711,"It was a close competition between Indiana and Florida: Which state in 2018 attracted the most Illinois residents for relocation?.  Indiana won. Nearly 26,000 Illinois tax filers (including their dependents) moved to Indiana in 2018, new Internal Revenue Service data shows . Out with Chicago-style pizza and beef sandwiches. In with pork tenderloin and sugar cream pie, two Hoosier staples..  Advertisement But Florida beaches beckoned too. Nearly 24,000 Illinoisans moved to Florida in 2018. Some Indiana residents and Floridians moved to Illinois, mind you, but not enough to make up the difference. Texas was the third most popular destination for Illinoisans, followed by California, Wisconsin, Missouri and Arizona..  What do Indiana and Florida boast that Illinois does not? Lower taxes, well-funded pension systems, balanced budgets and, in Florida’s case, sunshine and ocean views. Who can compete with that? Uncle! Uncle!.  You’ve seen the numbers. U.S. census data released in December showed Illinois’ net population since 2013 has dropped by more than 223,000 residents, roughly the equivalent of Naperville and Bolingbrook wiped off the map. That number includes births, deaths, domestic and international migration..  The IRS numbers are a separate data set and a year behind the census calculations, but they also show the growing gap between people leaving Illinois and not enough domestic migration and new births to make up the difference. The U-Hauls are not headed this way. Gee. Wonder why..  What gets lost in the numbers is the ripple effect. Those 223,000 people won’t be paying taxes in Illinois — not income, sales, property, gasoline, alcohol, cigarette, cannabis, you name it. They won’t be buying homes or cars or groceries or home goods. They’re not raising kids here, buying school supplies or signing them up for sports. They’re not opening new businesses or expanding existing ones. Just about every corner of the Illinois economy is affected by population loss.

712,".  Illinois State House District 89 issued the following announcement on Jan. 3.  Chesney Guest Column: Rural Illinois “Not Forgotten” when it comes to Higher Taxes and Fees.  It’s no secret that much of rural Illinois, the vast region of Illinois outside of Chicago and the collar counties, feels forgotten by Chicago democrats running Illinois when it comes to things like state spending priorities..  We see these arguments play out every day at gas stations, coffee shops, and at nearly any gathering of rural residents throughout our state. If you live in rural Illinois, you probably even talked about it more than you’d care to admit this holiday season. However, there is one area of life in which nearly nobody in rural Illinois feels forgotten- taxation and fees. With well over $1.4 billion in new taxes and fees taking effect with the New Year, rural residents are far from immune from the disproportionate effects of these revenue extraction schemes on their small towns, farms and, frankly, their resolve to remain in Illinois..  A new trade-in tax aimed at used vehicles results in double-taxation for many Illinoisans, whether their vehicle was purchased in-state or out-of-state. Hugely increased license plates fees for automobiles and higher motor fuel taxes certainly have a disproportionate effect on areas lesser served by mass transit and where commutes are longer due to employment and medical care availability. Recreation activities enjoyed by many more people in rural areas than urban include boating, fishing and use of ATVs; boat and trailer owners are finding more taxes and fees increasingly hostile to their ability to enjoy the activities afforded them in rural Illinois. With fewer brick-and-mortar businesses in rural Illinois than in the Chicago area, new online sales tax increases ensure rural residents bear additional brunt of the tax burden for their “inconvenience” of shopping online for items unavailable nearby..  The increased taxes on all Illinoisans⁠— rural, suburban and urban⁠— are being spent with very unequal input from stakeholders paying the bill for this excess. This is largely due to gerrymandered legislative maps and the disproportionate power structures they engender. In the New Year, we will see new debates on many new issues. Perhaps it’s long past time that supermajority democrats, capable of passing whatever they want on their own with no republican support, finally pass a Fair Map Amendment and finally address Illinois’ high property taxes. Neither of these two issues contradict any progressive social stances of the Governor and his supermajority party but would give many hardworking Illinoisans some hope to keep up their resolve and stay in Illinois a little while longer. After all, you’ll need them to continue paying those higher taxes and fees democrats presented in their stockings this year..  These taxes and fees are a lot of straws to throw on the camels’ backs all at once, so I’m not surprised to hear so many backs breaking by the actions of this State they once loved. With top in the nation population loss, isn’t it time to try something new in 2020? After all, there is no way to extract further taxes out of the growing liege of Illinois’ expatriates..

714,"CHICAGO (CBS) — Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said a “beloved” city employee has died of COVID-19..  During her regular coronavirus news conference, the mayor would not reveal the name of the person “out of respect for the family” and until all family members have been notified..  Lightfoot said that the person was a “long standing” employee beloved by family and coworkers. She did acknowledge while she did not know the man personally, the city is notifying the co-workers of the deceased in their department..  “This sobering moment should remind us that the numbers that we report every day are not merely statistics. They are people whose lives have been forever changed and a network of people, connected by crisis, who need us to do everything we can every day to save lives,” Lightfoot said..  The mayor repeated her call to follow the stay at home order put in place by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker..  “This is a deadly disease. It does not discriminate,” Lightfoot said, adding that despite the warmer weather that’s approaching, the order to stay inside stands. “Each of our individual actions has a direct impact on everyone else. It is truly a matter of life and death.”.  However, she stressed that short respites outdoors are allowed, within reason..  “It’s fine to get some fresh air. The issue isn’t exercise, it is congregating. Which is why we took steps to shut down lakefront is because people weren’t getting the message about congregating,” Lightfoot said. “For now and through April 30, do what you’ve been doing, and stay home to save lives.”.  Also announced, the Chicago Housing Authority will defer payments for tenants while the stay at home order is in place through the end of April. The move will affect thousands across the city..  For Chicago Public Schools students, food services won’t end during the spring break period..  “The provision of food will continue,” she said..  Lightfoot also announced the formation of the Arts For Illinois relief fund, to help artists throughout the city struggling at this time. She said anyone wishing to donate or find out more information can go to the site Arts For Illinois . The effort is being lead by Pritzker’s wife, First Lady MK Pritzker and Lightfoot’s wife, Amy Eschelman..  The mayor also took the opportunity to remind people it’s Census Day and information provided to the government will help the city receive federal funds for everything from education programs to infrastructure..  “You’ve read and heard about stimulus packages. Revenue from government depends on population, and that depends on the census. Step up and make sure everyone is counted,” she said..  When asked whether there would be a parade or celebration some time in the future to honor essential workers in the COVID-19 battle, Lightfoot said they should be acknowledged, but it’s too early to plan a public mass gathering..  “We have to follow public health guidance we will follow after the peak. We won’t know for some time. There will be cause for celebration and we have begun to think of what that looks like,” Lightfoot said. “It will be a great day for us. What I have seen these past few weeks, the selflessness and sacrifice, we want to celebrate and reward that spirit.”","[0.6303433775901794, 0.36965659260749817]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6303433775901794

SPRINGFIELD -- Health officials say 986 new cases of COVID-19 and 42 additional deaths related to the virus have been confirmed in Illinois as of Wednesday, representing a 42 percent jump in the number of fatalities from figures made available by the state a day earlier..  ""The coming weeks are going to get more and more difficult as the number of cases and deaths continue to rise,"" Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said, noting that people should continue washing their hands, staying home and cleaning frequently-touched surfaces..  ""All of these things seem minimal, but these are the courageous actions that are going to save lives and eventually end this pandemic,"" Ezike said. ""It's everyone's behavior that will begin to turn the tide."".  These latest statistics bring the total number of confirmed cases in Illinois up to 6,980, including 141 deaths. Cases have been found in 56 counties, with Massac and Vermilion counties reporting their first cases..

Ezike said a higher number of deaths is not unexpected as the number of cases continues to rise, and according to the latest studies the fatality rate of COVID-19 is between one and three percent. Mitigation strategies could help Illinois get ""ahead of the curve"" in the number of deaths, Ezike said..  ""We will see growth in the number of deaths, most unfortunately, until we get to that peak. Hopefully we will have done as much as we can so the peak is lower than what was originally anticipated,"" Ezike said..  On Tuesday, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker announced he would extend the state’s stay-at-home order and keep schools closed through April 30, saying it was necessary to keep the spread of COVID-19 from overwhelming the healthcare system..

Based on the last census, Pritzker said the state currently receives $34 billion in federal funding, and the state could lose $195 million for each one percent ""we undercount ourselves."".  Households across the United States have been receiving invitations to complete the 2020 census for weeks. But another milestone in the count is here: April 1 is known as Census Day..

With population decreasing statewide, it may not come as a surprise to learn that the new construction industry in Illinois has not been on par with other states across the country. But the idea that 2019 saw Illinois sink to nearly the bottom of the pile when it comes to new building activity might be a bit more of a shock. Image credit: Construction Coverage.  Still, that is indeed the case according to Construction Coverage, a site that provides research and reviews for the building trades. The firm analyzed building permit data from the U.S. Census Bureau to determine the number of new housing units per 10,000 residents in each state and found that in 2019, Illinois was second only to Rhode Island in terms of its new construction per capita. In 2019, 16.4 new housing units were built for every 10,000 residents, for a total of 20,917. Across the U.S., the same houses-to-people ratio stood at 41.9..  The national data does show a slowdown too, but that’s been more gradual. Researchers found the figure of new housing units per capita is still increasing across the country, but at a much slower pace than it once was. The change in new housing units per capita between 2018 and 2019 was just 2.5% — a significant slow-down when one considers that, between 2010 and 2018, the average annual growth rate in this figure was 9.2%..  Researchers noted that population levels drive much of these new-construction decisions. While the national 5-year population growth was 3.5%, Illinois saw a decrease of 1.1% over the same period. “States in the South and West, which have experienced above-average population growth in recent years, are investing the most in new housing. New residential construction per capita in Idaho and Utah, in particular, exceed the national rate of 41.9 units per 10,000 residents by more than 100 percent,” the researchers noted..  One metric where Illinois beat out the national average was in housing density. While 56.9% of new residential construction in Illinois was multifamily in 2019, the figure for the entire country on that metric was just 37.7%..  Of course, this data reflects the state of the local construction industry before the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.

719,"Apr 01, 2020 New album from SPECIAL CONSENSUS pays tribute to their hometown of Chicago On the heels of their Grammy®-nominated, IBMA “Album of the Year” winner RIVERS AND ROADS , Special Consensus celebrates their 45th anniversary with the release of CHICAGO BARN DANCE . The new project is a love note of sorts to Chicago, hometown of the band’s founder and banjo player, Greg Cahill. Special Concensus shared the title track with Bluegrass Today. Check it out HERE The album’s title track, written for the project by Becky Buller, Missy Raines and the album’s producer, Alison Brown , tells the story of the legendary WLS-AM Chicago radio show “National Barn Dance,” a precursor to the Grand Old Opry, and features the exquisite twin fiddling of Grammy®-winning fiddle legend Michael Cleveland alongside Becky Buller. Americana icon Robbie Fulks, a former band member and longtime Chicago resident, wrote “East Chicago Blues” especially for the project and contributes an impassioned lead vocal performance. Written from the first person perspective of bluegrass creator Bill Monroe, the song tells Monroe’s personal journey of trading a farmer’s life in Kentucky for the oil refineries in Chicago..  “My Kind of Town” is a creative re-imagining of the Sinatra classic into a bluegrass instrumental featuring the twin banjos of Greg Cahill and Alison Brown alongside the twin fiddles of Mike Barnett and Pat McAveninue . Guitarist and lead vocalist Rick Faris shines on “Lake Shore Drive,” a grassy cover of the ’70s pop hit from beloved Chicago band Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah, as well as their arrangement of “The City of New Orleans” where Faris, along with bandmates Nate Burie (mandolin) and Dan Eubanks (bass) provides lead vocals. Another stand-out track includes their rendition of the John Fogerty classic “Looking out my Back Door” featuring a wonderful Dobro performance from Compass labelmate Rob Ickes ..  CHICAGO BARN DANCE not only establishes Special Consensus as one of Chicago’s most prized musical treasures but also draws the connection between Chicago and the evolution of early country and bluegrass music. Chicago’s WLS-AM “National Barn Dance,” from its heyday in the 1920s through the 1940s, regularly featured such artists as Hank Williams, Bill and Charlie Monroe, Patsy Montana and Lulu Belle and Scotty and provided a sense of connection and comfort to the many Southerners who migrated from the Appalachian states in search of work, including the father of bluegrass music, Bill Monroe. Now, 45 years into their journey, Special Consensus continues to celebrate the nexus between the Windy City and bluegrass music with this spirited tribute to their hometown.

720,"Amid a global pandemic that has grown to include 6,980 cases in Illinois and 141 deaths, Gov. J.B. Pritzker is calling on Illinois residents to think about the future on National Census Day..   “We are in the biggest battle of our lifetimes against COVID-19, but it’s important to look beyond this fight today and to take a moment to think about our future,” Pritzker said Wednesday afternoon. “It is incredibly important that every Illinois resident, from newborn babies to great-grandparents, is counted in the census. The census is far more than just a survey, it will determine how much of your tax dollars we get back from the federal government and help decide how much power Illinois will have in terms of congressional representation and electoral college votes for the next decade.”.  Each year, the state receives $34 billion in federal funding for things like education, child care, workforce training and health care, Pritzker said. “But if we fail to count everyone in Illinois it could result in the state losing $195 million per year for each 1% we undercount ourselves.”.  Acknowledging the fears and anxiety people have about COVID-19, Pritzker said this invisible enemy also “illustrates how connected we all are and how important it is we keep the structural foundation of our society well funded and well fought for.”.  The best thing people can do to help the state in the long run is to continue to stay home “and take 10 minutes to fill out your census,” Pritzker said, adding there is no citizenship question on that form. “It has never been easier to respond on your own to the census, all without having to meet a census taker in person.”.  COVID-19 Cases in Illinois.  Infogram Also on Wednesday, Pritzker, along with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, announced the creation of the Arts for Illinois Relief Fund to provide financial assistance to artists, artisans and cultural organizations impacted by COVID-19..  “I’m here today to represent tens of thousands of artists – brilliant, talented and passionate individuals across Illinois who have been separated from their livelihood as well. Exhibitions and performances for my friends and colleagues and for myself have been canceled,” said Chicago artist Amanda Williams. “And I’m seeing firsthand how artists are hurting from this crisis.”.  In a statewide survey assessing the financial impact of coronavirus-related closures, 320 respondents estimated their organizations will lose more than $84 million in revenue due to the cancellation of events until the end of April, according to Arts Alliance Illinois, which conducted the survey. Those closures impact 24,124 individual events or performances; 3,563 full-time jobs; 13,144 part-time and contract jobs; and nearly 2.5 million audience members or participants, according to officials..  “We will not stop making, creating, inspiring, challenging, bearing witness and bringing hope. In fact, that’s all that we know to do in these moments. We’re here not just to ask for your support but to also be part of the solution in this moment of crisis,” Williams said. “Even now, we’re still creating and connecting – albeit virtually – and we’re sheltering in place. And we need the arts now more than ever.”.  To date, public and private sources have committed more than $4 million to the statewide initiative , according to a press release announcing the fund. The initiative is a partnership between the city of Chicago, state of Illinois and the broader philanthropic community, and fundraising activities will be co-chaired by first lady MK Pritzker and first lady Amy Eshleman..  Individual artists and artisans – including stage and production members, and part-time cultural workers – can apply for one-time grants of $1,500. The grants will be awarded through a lottery system and distributed quickly, according a press release..

Advertisement Nuñez, the director of organizing at Enlace Chicago, made the video in his home after the organization scrapped door knocking and a Loteria-themed census night in Little Village because of COVID-19. On census day, April 1, the group planned a different kind of outreach push, joining a caravan driving through the Latino neighborhood hoping residents would see messages about the census..  In Illinois, nearly 40% of households had filled out the census, a higher rate than the national response of 36.2%, according to the Census Bureau . In Chicago, the response rate Tuesday was 29.5%, which is a slightly higher rate than that of Los Angeles and about the same as Houston..  But households in some of the city’s Latino neighborhoods, like Little Village, aren’t participating as quickly as other parts of Chicago, according to a map of census data compiled by the City University of New York . Organizers and experts say these communities could be lagging both because of a digital divide and because of a misconception that the census will ask who is a citizen ..  Little Village residents and members of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights drive in a caravan around the neighborhood to remind residents to participate in the 2020 census.(Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune) “Everyone doesn’t have a computer, everyone definitely doesn’t have internet,” Nuñez said by phone. “So then it’s just understanding those realities.

While the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) announced today that the unemployment rate fell -0.1 percentage point to 3.4 percent, a new record low, the state is responding to a surge of unemployment claims in March due to the impacts of COVID-19. To this point, March unemployment claims total 133,763 compared to 27,493 over the same period in 2019..  In February, nonfarm payrolls were about unchanged, down -200 jobs based on preliminary data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and released by IDES.

724,"Look at those faces accompanying this post and just below. Nobody deserves or should die a violent death in a civilized society. Yet in Chicago, so far this year over 4 dozen children have been slaughtered by Chicago's gang thugs. The horrendous figures are indeed difficult to unpack, 582 souls murdered, and over 3,121 more wounded. One would think that the entire City would be focused on those startling numbers..  However, the focus and the headlines are about some controversial shooting that took place over 300 miles away from Chicago many months ago. Suddenly thousands of legal experts who never heard a shred of evidence are more expert in the rules of law and evidence than a Grand Jury. What the hell does a Grand Jury know? Let's take to the streets and let it be known how we stand, after all, we know what really took place. Justice for Breonna Taylor, never mind the law. We are a mob, loud, threatening, and sopping up all the publicity there is to go around..  Just in case that wasn't getting enough attention here comes the ""CENSUS COWBOY"" hired by Mayor Lightfoot to pump up the Census numbers in Chicago. He's now known as the DREADHEAD COWBOY. Here he is a convicted felon who decides a little publicity for himself was just what the doctor ordered. His stunt was to make a dash during rush hour on Chicago's busiest expressway on his horse. The mad dash amid utter chaos caused traffic to come to a complete halt while State and Local Police chased him down and arrested him on several charges including felony cruelty to an animal. His horse is not expected to survive. One veterinarian stated that his indifference to his horse was on a par of forcing and 80-year-old human to sprint 8 miles full speed..  Are these much-needed distractions for Chicago's leaders, a Clown act on an expressway, and a controversial verdict 300 miles away? Oh, by the way, the Clown act by the Dreadhead Cowboy was immediately denounced by his creator, Mayor Lightfoot who somehow managed to find about 10 gallons of vinegar to pour on the Cowboy. Bla Bla, how could this be my fault? Soon no doubt she will understand how many people in the world love animals..  Regardless of how one looks at the situation, they both got the media's full attention and not one scintilla of a mention of the slaughter on Chicago's streets. It makes one seriously wonder if Chicago hasn't completely gone off the rails. Last week John Kass of the Chicago Tribune reported that there was a move afoot to purchase bulletproof backpacks for Chicago's schoolchildren. The initiative being undertaken by a group of violence interrupters, a beleaguered overworked group of folks who are out in the neighborhoods attempting to make sense of the violence and trying to interact with the gang thugs. The photo below will most likely startle anyone who has an ounce of decency, children actively learning how to juggle bulletproof backpacks in order not to be killed. If you tell your friends and people who are not from Chicago you may want to show them these photos, they may be skeptical that an American City would actually resort to that..  The violence numbers are more than horrendous in themselves but remember these words while being distracted by Clown acts and isolated incidents that happen hundreds of miles away from Chicago's percolating and exploding mayhem. Words that the City's politicians have ignored while most likely ecstatic at the welcome DISTRACTIONS. After John Kass woke us to the bulletproof backpacks how much more did we hear of them? These are the words that Chicago's leaders need to pay attention too. ALL THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE TRIUMPH OF EVIL IS FOR GOOD MEN AND WOMEN TO DO NOTHING."".  Chicago needs to quit being distracted by fools and clowns and look at what's taking place in their own City. Look to the faces of those children already taken and those who they leave behind. Good men and women are indeed doing nothing and the local politicians are thankful. Talk is cheap and loyalty is an expensive commodity, don't expect it from cheap politicians who continue to keep talking and spinning. An entire City is dizzy.","[0.5073434710502625, 0.49265649914741516]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5073434710502625
725,"(The Center Square) – Arizona residents who relocated from Illinois since 2011 could be eligible to participate in a cash settlement the state of Illinois reached with Facebook over the social media giant's facial recognition software..  According to U.S. Census Bureau data, 69,422 Illinoisans relocated to Arizona between 2011 and 2017..  Facebook’s agreed settlement, which will cost the company $650 million, was recently finalized. This allows people who qualify as a member of the class action case against the California company to apply for their share of the pot of money. Each person could get up to $400..  Facebook began notifying users on their platform Wednesday evening, directing them to facebookbipaclassaction.com to confirm the user had been a resident of Illinois for at least six months since 2011 and allow them to put their name in for a cut at the settlement..  “This is a significant settlement in which households could end up with upwards of $800 depending on how many claims are filed,” said Christopher Dore, partner at Edelson PC, the Chicago-based law firm that represented the plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit..  Facebook users forego their right to sue the platform by joining the class-action suit..  Since the case is on behalf of anyone who lived in the state between June of 2011 Aug. 19 of this year and isn’t confined to current residents, the hundreds of thousands of former Illinois residents who have moved elsewhere are also entitled to join the suit if they qualify..  Since 2011, IRS data shows more than 1.8 million people have moved out of Illinois. Most of them moved to Indiana, Texas, Florida, California, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Arizona. Former Illinoisans who moved their Facebook profile with them are likely eligible..  The window to sign up closes on Nov. 23..  The settlement stems from Facebook’s facial recognition feature that captures the details of a user’s face, then references it when asking them if another picture on the social media site is also a picture they would like to tag themselves in..  That storage of facial data got Facebook sued for an alleged violation of Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act, which forbids capture or storage of biometric data without express consent. Fines for violating the law start at $1,000 per violation..  The law, enacted in 2008, has spawned dozens of lawsuits, most notably against Facebook, Google, Six Flags Great America, and Amazon Web Services..  Illinois’ law differs from similar ones in other states in that BIPA allows private citizens to sue. In other states, the attorney general must take action under the law..  The threat of litigation has resulted in several technological services to be unavailable to Illinoisans..  Google’s Nest cameras, for instance, disable a facial recognition feature that allows users to store familiar faces and give notifications about when the familiar face or one that’s not known is seen. This can be tied to their other technology to do things like unlocking doors when the known person simply walks up to the camera. Once the technology recognizes it’s set up in a location outside of Illinois, it enables the feature.","[0.5083963871002197, 0.49160367250442505]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5083963871002197
726,"Horse Ridden On Chicago Highway By Mayor’s ‘Census Cowboy’ May Be Euthanized by September 25, 2020, 7:55 am Total 120.  Cook County prosecutors say the horse ridden down the Dan Ryan Expressway by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s “Census Cowboy” was forced to do the equivalent of an 80-year-old woman running a full marathon. The horse, ridden 7 1/2 miles down the highway, may have to be euthanized, according to the prosecutors who say the horse wasn’t equipped for the ride and was almost run to death by Adam Hollingsworth..  Over the summer, Lightfoot introduced Hollingsworth to the Chicago community and announced he would be used to get the word out about filling out census forms via his Dreadhead Cowboy act. The cowboy rode into a press conference atop his horse Prince, who is now in very bad shape thanks to the actions on the highway..  An equine veterinarian told authorities the horse suffered “a great deal” during the ride and there was “profuse” bleeding due to lack of proper shoes for the pavement..  Even if Prince is to survive, he’ll never be able to be ridden again, according to the state attorney in charge of the animal cruelty case..  As for the mayor, she’s now furious with the cowboy she hailed back in July. “What is clear is that this stunt not only seriously endangered the horse, but also the rider and all travelers on the expressway,” Lightfoot said in a statement . “There is a right way and a wrong way to call attention to issues of great importance, and this stunt was decidedly the very wrong way.” The man appointed by Mayor Lightfoot to be Chicago’s “Census Cowboy” rode his horse until it bled to draw attention to a social justice cause.

Hollingsworth said that he rode the horse on the Dan Ryan Expressway during rush hour to support the #KidsLivesMatter movement, according to the outlet, which describes the initiative as one “that aims to raise awareness and motivate residents to fill out the census to help communities receive better funding.”.  According to Block Club Chicago , the movement is in response to children killed by gun violence..  In August, Hollingsworth told the Block Club, “When you get kids occupied and they’ve got things to do with their time and their life … all this senseless killing that’s going on, it’ll slow down a whole lot. It’s important to support dance groups [or] anything that’s got something to do with kids. If it’s something positive, support it.”.  Witnesses of the Dan Ryan Expressway incident told the outlet that they saw Hollingsworth kicking and whipping the horse to keep it running even after it slowed its pace due to exhaustion and injury. Shortly after, the horse collapsed on the ground..  Emergency veterinarians responded to the scene and took the horse in for treatment of severe dehydration, overheating, and lacerations to its front legs that caused heavy bleeding. Authorities took Hollingsworth into custody..  WFLD-TV reported that the horse also had sores beneath its saddle, which was not properly padded. A felony charge and a rebuke from the mayor.  In a statement, Mayor Lightfoot’s office condemned Hollingsworth’s “stunt.”.  “There is a right way and a wrong way to call attention to issues of great importance and this stunt was decidedly the very wrong way,” the mayor’s office said in its statement..  Hollingsworth was charged with a felony count of aggravated cruelty to an animal, as well as misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct, trespassing, and other traffic-related offenses..  At the time of this reporting, the horse remains in critical condition, and will never be able to be ridden again..  The horse may also have to be euthanized due to its injuries and “due to the suffering the animal will likely endure for the rest of its life.”.  Hollingsworth was held on $25,000 bond during a Wednesday court appearance, and was required to pay 10%. He is due back in court on Sept. 30. ‘Lori, come help me, I can’t do it alone’.  On Thursday, a tearful Hollingsworth told the Chicago Sun-Times that he did not abuse the horse..  “My focus is on the ‘Kids Lives Matter’ because if you look up the history of when it comes down to kids getting killed, 2020 is the highest rate … and it ain’t right,” he told reporters. “Everybody is trying to steer away from that part, and that is very important — that is an important topic we need to stick on.”.  Hollingsworth insisted that how he treated the horse was “no different than how horses are treated in the circus or at a racetrack,” the outlet reported..  “The people that don’t know anything about horses looking from the outside in, you would think that what I did was cruelty to animals,” he explained. “But if you go to a racetrack, it’s 100 times worse, if you go to a circus, worse. … It’s way worse than what I do to my horses. I probably could’ve did a little bit less, but I had to make a statement.”.  He also insisted that the description of the horse’s injuries were exaggerated, and that he would like to appoint an independent veterinarian to examine the horse..  “I think that is just a way to make the situation seem worse than it is because I am a black brother and I am doing very good for the community and standing up for the Kids Lives Matter movement and not focused on anything else,” Hollingsworth reasoned..  He also revealed that he has been the subject of abuse since his arrest..  “Every day I step outside I am taking a chance with my life,” he said. “I basically look at [the hate mail] and just close them. I can’t change how a person feels.”.

In a wildly upsetting story out of Chicago – because it must be a day that ends in “y” – a man known to the community as the “Dreadhead Cowboy” rode his horse down the interstate as part of a protest until the animal began to bleed from its injuries, which may result in the horse having to be put down..  According to local reports, the popular horse-riding activist, whose real name is Adam Hollingsworth, rode a horse for eight miles down the Dan Ryan Expressway during rush hour on Monday as part of the #KidsLivesMatter movement, which aims to get Chicago residents to fill out the census to get more funding for their communities. Hollingsworth has been working with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to boost census participation in the city..  But experts say the horse wasn’t equipped with the proper shoes to ride such a long distance almost entirely at a gallop in the hot sun on the pavement, and that the ride resulted in serious injuries. Photos and videos from the scene show blood running down the animal's legs during the ride. Witnesses say they saw Hollingsworth kicking and whipping the horse after it slowed down, until it eventually collapsed..  After Hollinsgworth was arrested, animal experts say they treated the horse for extreme dehydration, overheating and lacerations to the legs that had been bleeding profusely. Only immediate medical attention saved the horse’s life after the run, and it still may need to be euthanized due to the severity of its wounds and the likelihood that it will remain crippled and in pain for the rest of its life.

A Chicago man known as the ‘Census Cowboy’ faces a felony charge after riding his horse more than 7 miles down a freeway without the proper footwear, severely injuring the animal, which prosecutors say may have to be euthanized..  Adam Hollingsworth, 33, was arrested earlier this week on charges linked to animal cruelty, reckless conduct, trespassing and other traffic offenses after staging a stunt on the Dan Ryan Expressway on horseback, shutting down the freeway as he rode the animal at galloping speed on rough pavement, critically wounding it. Chicago’s ‘Dreadhead Cowboy’ arrested after riding a horse on a busy highway pic.twitter.com/1GCHP868v8.  Speaking publicly for the first time after bailing out of Cook County jail on $25,000 bond on Thursday, Hollingsworth insisted he did not mean to hurt the animal – named Nunu – and that he was merely trying to raise awareness for what he called the “Kids Lives Matter” cause. He did, however, acknowledge riding the animal for too long..  “I didn’t mean no harm on my horse at all. I’m a horse- [and] animal-loving person,” he told reporters. “My focus is Kids Lives Matter. And if a person can’t agree with that, I don’t know what to call you.”.  I love Nunu… She is one of my newer horses. I’ve had her about three months and we’ve grown a bond. A bond like she’s one of my kids..  Prosecutors say that the creature was severely dehydrated, exhausted and suffering serious injuries to her hooves when she collapsed on the asphalt expressway in critical condition on Monday, after which she was brought to an animal shelter for treatment. While the shelter said Nunu’s condition is improving, authorities noted she can never be ridden again and may still have to be euthanized if she is unable to regain her ability to walk..  Hollingsworth was skeptical about the prosecutors’ claims, suggesting they overstated the extent of the animal’s injuries in order to harm his public image. He also noted he is now seeking a private lawyer to get Nunu back, adding “they haven’t told me anything about my horse.”.  Despite disputing local authorities’ account of Monday’s stunt, Hollingsworth said he would “do it again” if he had the chance. “I’ve been to jail. I’ve got a background. I’m not perfect. I would rather go to jail for something like [this],” he said. “That is something worth going to jail for.”.  In wrapping up his brief presser on Thursday, the man called on Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot to help him with his legal case, also appealing to Chicago-area hip hop artists for assistance, including Common, Kanye West and Chance the Rapper..  Hollingsworth has made a name for himself around Chicago, taking on the moniker ‘Dreadhead Cowboy’ after showing up on horseback at locations around the city’s Southside. He was later dubbed the ‘Census Cowboy’ as part of a publicity stunt arranged by Lightfoot to encourage participation in the census count, which has since been lambasted online as cringeworthy and a waste of taxpayer money..

734,"Chicago Mayor’s ‘Census Cowboy’ Facing Animal Cruelty Charges After Nearly Riding His Horse To Death — Here’s The 411.  Written by K. Walker on September 25, 2020 1 shares Share.  The “Dreadhead Cowboy” was riding to grab some headlines and encourage Chicagoans to fill out the 2020 Census. It didn’t go so well….  Adam Hollingsworth, 33, a.k.a. the “Dreadhead Cowboy” became something of a local celebrity after he was spotted riding his horse and wearing a cowboy hat in downtown Chicago during several of the “mostly peaceful protests” in the wake of the death of George Floyd..  In July, Hollingsworth had been tasked by Mayor Lori Lightfoot to help her achieve her goal of having a 75% response rate for the 2020 Census. She called him the “Census Cowboy.”.  Trending: TEXAS RELOADED: New Crenshaw Campaign Ad Will Make You Scream Like A Bald Eagle.  A few days ago, Hollingsworth rode his horse, NuNu, down the Dan Ryan Expressway at a gallop for 7.5 miles during rush hour for an impromptu protest to support the #KidsLivesMatter movement — an initiative that motivates Chicago residents to fill out the Census to receive better funding for communities..  The protest was covered as a lively story on the local news: A man riding a horse held up traffic on Monday – on a Chicago highway. The so-called ""Dreadhead Cowboy,"" who is also known as the Census Cowboy, live-streamed his stunt on Facebook. He rode six miles on horseback before being guided off the busy highway and arrested. pic.twitter.com/Im2G3d5wLF.  — CBS News (@CBSNews) September 22, 2020.  But it turns out, the little jaunt wasn’t so great for NuNu..  Hollingsworth rode NuNu down the Expressway until the horse collapsed..  Cook County prosecutors said that the horse would not have survived without immediate treatment and may still have to be euthanized. They said that the 7.5 mile ride without proper shoes was equivalent to “forcing an 80-year-old woman run a full marathon.”.  Adam Hollingsworth , 33, was held on $25,000 bond during a court appearance Wednesday after he was charged with a felony count of aggravated cruelty to an animal, as well as misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct, trespassing and other traffic offenses. He must pay 10% of that amount, $2,500, to be released from jail….  …Cook County Assistant State’s Attorney Kevin Deboni said the horse was ill-equipped for this ride and was run almost to death..  Hollingsworth allegedly rode the horse onto the Dan Ryan at the 35th Street feeder ramp at around 4:30 p.m. Deboni said the horse spent most of the ride galloping, but it did not have on proper shoes for the pavement, which caused bleeding and “extensive damage” to its health..  Law enforcement began trailing Hollingsworth on the expressway until the horse collapsed at around 9500 South Lafayette, Deboni said, adding that onlookers allegedly saw Hollingsworth kicking and whipping the horse to keep it galloping after it slowed down..  Source: WTTW.  Experts who examined NuNu said that the horse suffered “a great deal” due to its treatment..  NuNu suffered from “extreme dehydration, overheating, and lacerations to its front legs that caused profuse bleeding.”The horse required extensive medical treatment and will never be able to be ridden again..  Both experts said it would have been “virtually impossible” for anyone to not have realized the animal was injured and in distress..  Deboni said, “The horse’s eyes were dilated to the point they looked like cartoon eyes.”.  Euthanasia may be the only humane option because the animal will be suffering tremendously for the rest of its life. Animal cruelty is now social justice. https://t.co/eBacAYLqGB.  — Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) September 25, 2020.  A Change.org petition has been created to ban Hollingsworth from owning an animal ever again..  Hollingsworth conducted a very strange interview after the incident saying that he didn’t regret his decision and would do it again. He doesn’t think that he was any more abusive to his horse than they are at horse tracks, the circus, or on farms, and said that his protest was important. I'LL DO IT AGAIN.

737,"In states where gerrymandering has been stamped out, competitive elections are the norm. But not in Illinois. Mar 12, 2020 2:00 PM (Zach Gibson/Getty Images).  BGA President David Greising writes a regular column for Crain's Chicago Business..  The hurly-burly around Super Tuesday produced an election event unlike anything we have seen. From Joe Biden's huge margin in the South Carolina primary to the moment Michael Bloomberg bailed out, the days were filled with momentous, surprising twists..  Labor unions and office workers, old and young, progressive and conservative: They all had their say. Candidates courted every ethnic cohort. County by county across the country, the electoral maps were a checkerboard of competing factors and forces that contributed to the results..  The candidates competed in the diners, the school gyms, the farmyards, the convention halls. They went over the airwaves, door to door, even selfie by selfie. They put out plans, paid out millions, secured endorsements and always, always stayed on the move..  This is what a fair election looks like. This is what happens when every interest group can have its say, when results can't be taken for granted, when ideas, organization, communication and leadership are the keys to success..  That level of competition for votes is possible on the state level, too. In states where gerrymandering has been stamped out, competitive elections are the norm..  In our state, the electoral map intentionally is drawn to be hubbub-free. The civics books talk about one person, one vote. As often as not, the Illinois gerrymandering playbook reduces that notion to a bizarre distortion: It's one candidate, one district..  Here's the math: In the 2018 election, half of the state's House and Senate districts saw uncontested races . All the candidates needed to do was get on the ballot to punch their tickets to Springfield. Another large number had two names on the ballot, but rigged mapmaking made them uncompetitive anyway. The 2016 race was worse: Nearly 60 percent of races were uncontested..  No wonder turnout is so low..  The gerrymandering of Illinois' electoral maps takes away a basic right—the right to pick our elected representatives. In recent years, Democrats have controlled the process. But that wasn't always the case. Until the 2002 election, Republican majorities controlled the Senate. They took part in gerrymandering, too..  Gerrymandering is less about party and more about protecting incumbency, regardless of party. Even in Democrat-dominated Illinois, certain districts intentionally are secured for incumbent Republicans..  Gerrymandering is un-American. It takes a meaningful vote away from millions of residents every year. Several cases have gone to the Supreme Court recently, but the court last year declared that partisan gerrymandering is a political problem . Ignoring the disenfranchisement of voters, it sent the issue back to the states..  The Illinois Supreme Court has disappointed, too. The Illinois court in 2016 invalidated a bid to change the state constitution, based on petitions signed by 550,000 residents, in a thinly argued, technical decision that safeguarded the powers of the smoke-filled rooms..  That can't be the last word. In Springfield this spring, a coalition of good-government groups—including the Better Government Association—is back in the fight. A BGA-backed bill proposes a nonpartisan commission to draw Illinois' electoral maps..  This is hardly a radical idea. In 21 U.S. states, it's already the law..  The electoral reform bill is considered a long shot. If it doesn't pass, Gov. J.B. Pritzker will represent the state's last, best hope for a fair map after the 2020 census. Pritzker has promised not to sign a gerrymandered map when the new map hits his desk in 2021..  Voters will find out next year if Pritzker will keep that commitment. They should remember what he did if he seeks re-election in 2022..  In the meantime, we'll always have this year's Super Tuesday—one of the most hotly contested election nights in memory..  You know hotly contested elections. They attract good candidates, air issues and get people involved in politics and government. Exactly the sort of effect Illinois' gerrymandered maps are designed to avoid. Author(s)","[0.5063732266426086, 0.4936268627643585]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5063732266426086

DEC. 30, 2019 — According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s national and state population estimates released today, forty-two states and the District of Columbia had fewer births in 2019 than 2018, while eight states saw a birth increase. With fewer births in recent years and the number of deaths increasing, natural increase (or births minus deaths) has declined steadily over the past decade..  “While natural increase is the biggest contributor to the U.S. population increase, it has been slowing over the last five years,” said Dr. Sandra Johnson, a demographer/statistician in the Population Division of the Census Bureau. “Natural increase, or when the number of births is greater than the number of deaths, dropped below 1 million in 2019 for the first time in decades.”.  The nation’s population was 328,239,523 in 2019, growing by 0.5% between 2018 and 2019, or 1,552,022 people. Annual growth peaked at 0.73% this decade in the period between 2014 and 2015. The growth between 2018 and 2019 is a continuation of a multiyear slowdown since that period..  The South, the largest of the four regions with a population of 125,580,448 in 2019, saw the largest numeric growth (1,011,015) and percentage growth (0.8%) between 2018 and 2019.This growth is driven mainly by natural increase (359,114) and net domestic migration (407,913), which is the movement of people from one area to another within the United States.The Northeast region, the smallest of the four regions with a population of 55,982,803 in 2019, saw population decrease for the first time this decade, declining by 63,817 or -0.1%. This decline was due to net domestic migration (-294,331), which offset population gains from natural increase (97,152) and net international migration (134,145), or the difference between the number of people moving into the country and out of the country..  Forty states and the District of Columbia saw population increases between 2018 and 2019. Ten states lost population between 2018 and 2019, four of which had losses over 10,000 people. The 10 states that lost population were New York (-76,790; -0.4%), Illinois (-51,250; -0.4%), West Virginia (-12,144; -0.7%), Louisiana (-10,896; -0.2%), Connecticut (-6,233; -0.2%), Mississippi (-4,871; -0.2%), Hawaii (-4,721; -0.3%), New Jersey (-3,835; 0.0%), Alaska (-3,594; -0.5%), and Vermont (-369 ; -0.1%)..  Also released today were national- and state-level estimates of the components of population change, which include tables on births, deaths and migration. Component ID: #ti1825487986 Puerto Rico Population Estimates.  Puerto Rico’s population increased by 340 people (0.0%) between 2018 and 2019 after several years of annual population decline. This slight increase is due to total net migration, which was positive for the first time in years (7,733) and large enough to offset the natural decrease (-7,393)..  ""Though migration between 2018 and 2019 was large enough to increase the population this year, Puerto Rico’s population remains below where it was at the start of the decade,” explained Johnson. Component ID: #ti1755527491 Additional Highlights:.  Nationally, net international migration continues to decrease, falling to 595,348 between 2018 and 2019. Between 2010 and 2019, the year with the highest net international migration was 2016 at 1,046,709; however, since 2016, the net international migration has been gradually decreasing each year. Between 2018 and 2019, natural increase was 956,674, reflecting 3,791,712 births and 2,835,038 deaths. 42 states and the District of Columbia had fewer births in 2019 than 2018. Eight states saw increases in births - Washington (612), Utah (293), Nevada (232), Arizona (175), Idaho (166), Montana (66), Vermont (44), and Colorado (30). Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia saw increases in their number of deaths compared to the previous year. Four states had more deaths than births, also called natural decrease: West Virginia (-4,679), Maine (-2,262), New Hampshire (-121) and Vermont (-53). Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia lost population through net domestic migration between 2018 and 2019, six of which had losses over 25,000, and three of which experienced losses greater than 100,000. The top states with net domestic migration loss were California (-203,414), New York (-180,649), Illinois (-104,986), New Jersey (-48,946), Massachusetts (-30,274) and Louisiana (-26,045). Nine states had a population of over 10 million in 2019. Those states were California (39,512,223), Texas (28,995,881), Florida (21,477,737), New York (19,453,561), Pennsylvania (12,801,989), Illinois (12,671,821), Ohio (11,689,100), Georgia (10,617,423) and North Carolina (10,488,084)..  During 2020, the Census Bureau will release estimates of the 2019 population for counties, cities and towns, and metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, as well as national, state and county population estimates by age, sex, race and Hispanic origin.

744,"Population Estimates Continue to Show the Nation’s Growth Is Slowing 2019 U.S. Population Estimates Continue to Show the Nation’s Growth Is Slowing FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: MONDAY, DECEMBER 30, 2019 2019 U.S. Population Estimates Continue to Show the Nation’s Growth Is Slowing December 30, 2019 EMAIL Component ID: #ti1732325027 Natural Increase Drops Below 1 Million for the First Time in Decades Due to Fewer Births and More Deaths.  DEC. 30, 2019 — According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s national and state population estimates released today, forty-two states and the District of Columbia had fewer births in 2019 than 2018, while eight states saw a birth increase. With fewer births in recent years and the number of deaths increasing, natural increase (or births minus deaths) has declined steadily over the past decade..  “While natural increase is the biggest contributor to the U.S. population increase, it has been slowing over the last five years,” said Dr. Sandra Johnson, a demographer/statistician in the Population Division of the Census Bureau. “Natural increase, or when the number of births is greater than the number of deaths, dropped below 1 million in 2019 for the first time in decades.”.  The nation’s population was 328,239,523 in 2019, growing by 0.5% between 2018 and 2019, or 1,552,022 people. Annual growth peaked at 0.73% this decade in the period between 2014 and 2015. The growth between 2018 and 2019 is a continuation of a multiyear slowdown since that period..  The South, the largest of the four regions with a population of 125,580,448 in 2019, saw the largest numeric growth (1,011,015) and percentage growth (0.8%) between 2018 and 2019.This growth is driven mainly by natural increase (359,114) and net domestic migration (407,913), which is the movement of people from one area to another within the United States.The Northeast region, the smallest of the four regions with a population of 55,982,803 in 2019, saw population decrease for the first time this decade, declining by 63,817 or -0.1%. This decline was due to net domestic migration (-294,331), which offset population gains from natural increase (97,152) and net international migration (134,145), or the difference between the number of people moving into the country and out of the country..  Forty states and the District of Columbia saw population increases between 2018 and 2019. Ten states lost population between 2018 and 2019, four of which had losses over 10,000 people. The 10 states that lost population were New York (-76,790; -0.4%), Illinois (-51,250; -0.4%), West Virginia (-12,144; -0.7%), Louisiana (-10,896; -0.2%), Connecticut (-6,233; -0.2%), Mississippi (-4,871; -0.2%), Hawaii (-4,721; -0.3%), New Jersey (-3,835; 0.0%), Alaska (-3,594; -0.5%), and Vermont (-369 ; -0.1%)..  Also released today were national- and state-level estimates of the components of population change, which include tables on births, deaths and migration. Component ID: #ti1825487986 Puerto Rico Population Estimates.  Puerto Rico’s population increased by 340 people (0.0%) between 2018 and 2019 after several years of annual population decline. This slight increase is due to total net migration, which was positive for the first time in years (7,733) and large enough to offset the natural decrease (-7,393)..  ""Though migration between 2018 and 2019 was large enough to increase the population this year, Puerto Rico’s population remains below where it was at the start of the decade,” explained Johnson. Component ID: #ti1755527491 Additional Highlights:.  Nationally, net international migration continues to decrease, falling to 595,348 between 2018 and 2019. Between 2010 and 2019, the year with the highest net international migration was 2016 at 1,046,709; however, since 2016, the net international migration has been gradually decreasing each year. Between 2018 and 2019, natural increase was 956,674, reflecting 3,791,712 births and 2,835,038 deaths. 42 states and the District of Columbia had fewer births in 2019 than 2018. Eight states saw increases in births - Washington (612), Utah (293), Nevada (232), Arizona (175), Idaho (166), Montana (66), Vermont (44), and Colorado (30). Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia saw increases in their number of deaths compared to the previous year. Four states had more deaths than births, also called natural decrease: West Virginia (-4,679), Maine (-2,262), New Hampshire (-121) and Vermont (-53). Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia lost population through net domestic migration between 2018 and 2019, six of which had losses over 25,000, and three of which experienced losses greater than 100,000. The top states with net domestic migration loss were California (-203,414), New York (-180,649), Illinois (-104,986), New Jersey (-48,946), Massachusetts (-30,274) and Louisiana (-26,045). Nine states had a population of over 10 million in 2019.

Getty Illinois will end the decade with the largest population loss in the country during the 2010s, according to newly released census estimates. Only four states — excluding the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico — experienced population loss since 2010. Illinois lost over 159,700 residents, or about 1.3% of its population, between 2010 and 2019. West Virginia followed with a loss of 60,871 people; Connecticut with 8,860; and Vermont with 1,748. Illinois kicked off the decade as the the fifth-most populous state but will end as the sixth behind California, Texas, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania. “After years of frustration, dysfunction and failure, Governor Pritzker is moving forward with big ideas that help working families — in a bipartisan way,” said Jordan Abudayyeh, spokeswoman for Gov. J.B. Pritzker. “The state has made historic investments in education and has begun repairing our social safety net.” These investments, Abudayyeh said, will help people stay in Illinois. The decline of Illinois’ population began in 2014 and hasn’t relented. Illinois lost 51,250 residents just in the past year — the second most in the country behind New York. In Cook County, the largest share of the population loss was among African American residents. From 2010 to 2018, the county’s African American population fell 5.8% from 1,311,698 to 1,236,170 — a loss of over 75,000 people.

ORLANDO, Fla. — The past year’s population growth rate in the United States was the slowest in a century due to declining births, increasing deaths and the slowdown of international migration, according to figures released Monday by the U.S. Census Bureau..  The U.S. grew from 2018 to 2019 by almost a half percent, or about 1.5 million people, with the population standing at 328 million this year, according to population estimates..  That’s the slowest growth rate in the U.S. since 1917 to 1918, when the nation was involved in World War I, said William Frey, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution..  For the first time in decades, natural increase — the number of births minus the number of deaths — was less than 1 million in the U.S. due to an aging population of Baby Boomers, whose oldest members entered their 70s within the past several years. As the large Boomer population continues to age, this trend is going to continue..  “Some of these things are locked into place. With the aging of the population, as the Baby Boomers move into their 70s and 80s, there are going to be higher numbers of deaths,” Frey said. “That means proportionately fewer women of child bearing age, so even if they have children, it’s still going to be less.”.  Four states had a natural decrease, where deaths outnumbered births: West Virginia, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont..  For the first time this decade, Puerto Rico had a population increase. The island, battered by economic stagnation and Hurricane Maria in the past several years, increased by 340 people between 2018 and 2019, with people moving to the island offsetting natural decrease..  International migration to the U.S. decreased to 595,000 people from 2018 to 2019, dropping from as many as 1 million international migrants in 2016, according to the population estimates. Immigration restrictions by the Trump administration combined with a perception that the U.S. has fewer economic opportunities than it did before the recession a decade ago contributed to the decline, Frey said..  “Immigration is a wildcard in that it is something we can do something about,” Frey said. “Immigrants tend to be younger and have children, and they can make a population younger.”.  Ten states had population declines in the past year. They included New York, which lost almost 77,000 people; Illinois, which lost almost 51,000 residents; West Virginia, which lost more than 12,000 people; Louisiana, which lost almost 11,000 residents; and Connecticut, which lost 6,200 people. Mississippi, Hawaii, New Jersey, Alaska and Vermont each lost less than 5,000 residents..  Regionally, the South saw the greatest population growth from 2018 to 2019, increasing 0.8% due to natural increase and people moving from others parts of the country. The Northeast had a population decrease for the first time this decade, declining 0.1% due primarily to people moving away..  Monday’s population estimates also offer a preview of which states may gain or lose congressional seats from next year’s apportionment process using figures from the 2020 Census. The process divvies up the 435 U.S. House seats among the 50 states based on population..  Several forecasts predict California, the nation’s most populous state with 39.5 million residents, losing a seat for the first time.

764,"Evelyn Holmes CHICAGO (WLS) -- National Census Day is going on as planned, despite the spread of COVID-19 across the country.Field operations in Chicago are on hold, but you can still complete the census online, over the phone or though the mail.At Gathering Point Universal Ministries, a bank of laptops sat dormant Wednesday. Efforts by the South Side church to make sure those in underserved and under-resourced communities are counted for in the 2020 census are now hindered by the threat of the virus.""But now that we have the social distancing thing going on, now it took away everything we worked hard for,"" said Pastor Richard Wooten.Like other community groups, Wooten's Greater Chatham Alliance has had to pull all of the neighborhood residents trained as outreach workers off the street for their own safety. They were enlisted to help other residents -- possibly distrustful of the process -- get the census done.As the world struggles with how to combat COVID-19, those who have partnered with census officials have turned to social media to still try and convince the hard to count of its importance.Advocates said the $1,400 federal officials allot per person during the count really adds up.Along with traditional messaging tools, there's also poster and video competitions to engage children so their parents will make sure they get counted too.As of Wednesday morning, self-response rates in Illinois were at 39%, which is above the national average of 36%.Chicago's rate is 29.5%, while Cook County is 34%, according to federal census data.The census happens every 10 years and this time, it places a special emphasis on those in underrepresented groups, such as black males ages 18 to 29 and communities where there are seniors, those under the age of 5 and homeless individuals.This year, you can respond for your household online or by phone or mail. The deadline for self-response has been moved to August 14.

765,"Flipboard Getty Images The Chicago area is playing catch-up to the majority of the nation’s big cities when it comes to new housing per capita. According to a recent study from Construction Coverage, Chicago metro built 19 housing units per 10,000 residents in 2019. The figure was well below the national average of 41.9 units per 10,000 residents and puts Chicago ninth-last among the country’s largest 53 metropolitan areas. While certain pockets of Chicago are booming—namely downtown and adjacent neighborhoods such as the West Loop —the report notes that Chicago’s population has decreased by 0.4 percent over the past five years, based on census data. That decline in residents—along with rising construction costs and unfavorable property taxes —certainly factors into the housing equation. The study’s findings are even less encouraging on the state level. Illinois added just 16.4 new housing units per 10,000 residents last year, which was the second-lowest in the country (behind only Rhode Island).

766,"Flipboard Getty Images The Chicago area is playing catch-up to the majority of the nation’s big cities when it comes to new housing per capita. According to a recent study from Construction Coverage, Chicago metro built 19 housing units per 10,000 residents in 2019. The figure was well below the national average of 41.9 units per 10,000 residents and puts Chicago ninth-last among the country’s largest 53 metropolitan areas. While certain pockets of Chicago are booming—namely downtown and adjacent neighborhoods such as the West Loop —the report notes that Chicago’s population has decreased by 0.4 percent over the past five years, based on census data. That decline in residents—along with rising construction costs and unfavorable property taxes —certainly factors into the housing equation. The study’s findings are even less encouraging on the state level. Illinois added just 16.4 new housing units per 10,000 residents last year, which was the second-lowest in the country (behind only Rhode Island). During the same five-year period, the state saw its population decline by 1.1 percent, according to the data.

And Pritzker says undercount will be costly..  “If we fail to count everyone in Illinois it could result in the state losing over $195-million per year in federal funds for every 1% we under-count ourselves.”.

770,"Save.  SPRINGFIELD — The state public health director on Wednesday issued a somber warning that Illinois residents can expect mounting numbers of illness and death in the new month from the vicious spread of the coronavirus..  The 6,980 cases of COVID-19 reported by Dr. Ngoze Ezike are double the state's total just last Saturday. Along with 986 new cases reported Wednesday were 42 deaths, the largest single-day increase since the first was reported March 17, bringing the state's total to 141..  ""The coming weeks are going to get more and more difficult as the number of cases and deaths continue to rise ...,"" Ezike said. ""Let's be strong and courageous. Don't be terrified, don't be discouraged."".  In Macon County, the number of positive cases remained at two. First confirmed last week, they are a woman in her 50s and man in his 60s. Thirty-eight tests have been completed, with 20 negative results and 16 pending..  Additionally, 13 Macon County residents have been tested elsewhere. Twelve results were negative and one is pending..  Ezike urged the public to maintain stop-the-spread tasks such as staying home and frequently washing hands. While simple, Ezike said, ""these are the courageous actions that are going to save lives and eventually end this pandemic."".  Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday extended his stay-at-home order through month's because of the continued steep climb in cases expected. The order to stay home unless reporting to a job deemed essential or to buy groceries or prescriptions was supposed to end April 7..  Pritzker's extension came the same day President Donald Trump braced the country for similarly alarming numbers across the nation. U.S. cases topped 200,000 Wednesday afternoon as the global total raced toward 1 million, according to Johns Hopkins University..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker speaks at the Thompson Center in Chicago during the daily update on the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic Monday. ASHLEE REZIN GARCIA, CHICAGO SUN-TIMES VIA AP.  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death..  In addition to programs for low-interest loans and other programs to help businesses shut down by the pandemic, Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced a fundraising effort to assist artists and arts organizations. Respondents to a survey said they expected to lose as much as $84 million their stages and galleries are dark. U.S. Census.  Pritzker also noted that Wednesday was Census Day in the United States. All people are required to report where they resided on that day. But the numbers are also used to determine how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending are distributed, including roughly $34 billion per year that flow to Illinois for things like education, child care, workforce training, transportation and health care..  The U.S. Constitution requires a census of all residents be conducted every 10 years in order to apportion representation in the U.S. House of Representatives..  The state of Illinois is spending $29 million as part of an effort to get an accurate count, and Pritzker said because of the outbreak, the state is now focusing that money mostly on outreach programs that target hard-to-count populations — rural communities, minority communities and low-income individuals and families, among others..  He also noted that because of the pandemic, the U.S. Census Bureau has temporarily suspended sending census workers into the field to do door-to-door canvassing of people who have not yet filled out their census forms..  People can fill out their census forms online this year, even by using a smartphone, by visiting My2020Census.gov . It can also be completed by phone at 844-330-2020..  “I want to remind everyone that there is no citizenship question on the census,” Pritzker said. “Let me repeat that there is no citizenship question on the census form. You will not be asked your immigration status and your information will not be shared with anyone.” Health care coverage and workforce.  Pritzker also said Wednesday that more than 1,100 former health care professionals and those who practice out of state have responded to his call to renew or apply for licenses in Illinois so they can join the workforce treating COVID-19 patients..  He said many of the out-of-state practitioners are actually Illinois residents who practice in border communities just outside the state..  “Right now those numbers are running about half-and-half, with more applications coming in every day,” he said. “It's really incredible to watch. The people of this state are truly so deeply genuinely caring.”.  But Pritzker had less kind words to say about Trump, who reportedly has refused requests by Democratic and Republican governors to reopen the enrollment period for people seeking insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act..  “Some White House officials are saying that the president will not be reopening the insurance marketplace in response to the coronavirus,” Pritzker said. “Frankly, this is leadership malpractice. Now more than ever, we need as many people as possible to have access to health care to seek out testing if we're ever going to be able to fight COVID-19 and eliminate it as a major risk to our people.”.

772,"The state could lose $195 million annually for every 1 percent of the population that is undercounted. Officials hope that the coronavirus pandemic doesn’t dissuade residents from participating in the Census. Shaquil Manigault, Rockford Register Star | April 3, 2020 | News.  (TNS) — In January, the Rockford, Ill., Region 1 Planning Council held a news conference to announce plans to be face to face with residents to ensure every person understood the importance of being counted by the 2020 census..  Then the coronavirus pandemic took hold, and every event meant to encourage census participation was either canceled or postponed..  Now, government officials in the region and the state are worried that the effects of the pandemic will result in less participation in the census. At stake is nearly $1,535 per person per year in federal funding for any Winnebago County resident who goes uncounted. Illinois could lose $195 million a year in federal funds for every 1 percent undercounted, Gov. JB Pritzker says. RELATED The Census Is Here and Everyone Counts: Here’s What to Do.  Programs like Medicaid, foster care, Pell Grants, SNAP, highway construction funding, Section 8, and the free and reduced-price lunch and breakfast program would all be at risk without a timely and accurate count..  Pritzker opened his daily news conference on Wednesday, which was National Census Day, by stressing the need for people to stay at home and participate in the census online, by mail or by phone..  ""The census is far more than just a survey,"" he said. ""It will determine how much of your tax dollars we get back from the federal government and it will help decide how much power Illinois will have in terms of congressional representation and Electoral College votes for the next decade."".  The state is redirecting its $29 million in census outreach spending to social media and expanded phone banking, texting and virtual assistance programs..  The planning council initially planned to host events to raise awareness and discuss the importance of participation in the census. The stay-at-home order has forced the group to adjust..  ""Oh my gosh, it has been a really radical change,"" said Region 1 Planning Council program manager Ivy Hood. ""The best way to communicate with somebody is usually to have a conversation with them, get out there and meet them where they are. This has forced us to entirely, almost exclusively, turn our operations online. And nearly everybody is working remotely."".  Instead of events like town halls and open forums, the planning council and government officials have shifted their marketing focus and money to television campaigns, digital billboards and radio and social media advertising..  ""We're going to be moving some dollars that we would have been spending on some of the forums and town halls and we're probably going to be upping our media buys,"" said Wester Wuori, chief of staff for the city of Rockford. ""We're going to hope to allocate some additional spending now that we would have spent on public events and move those into electronic and other media."".  Social media was a primary marketing tool for the planning council. On Thursday, Hood, state Rep. Maurice West, D-Rockford, and Mustafa Abdall, an English-as-a-second-language teacher at Lincoln Middle School, hosted a Facebook live event on West's Facebook page to educate residents on the importance of filling out the census..  Last week, the U.S Census Bureau announced the deadline for self-response would be extended from July 31 to Aug. 14 because of the coronavirus pandemic..  Despite the extension, Hood says that an inaccurate count is inevitable..  ""It would be optimistic to suggest that we might only have a small impact. I think the COVID-19 will really impact the results that we see come back,"" Hood said..  Enumerators typically would go door to door to follow up with residents who have not yet completed the census. As of right now, the U.S Census has postponed the canvass by at least two weeks..  However, an increase in participation is also possible. This is the first year that the census has been made available online, which makes it more accessible than previously. Go to my2020census.gov to complete the questionnaire online..  Wuori timed himself taking the online census and it took him only six minutes to complete, consistent with census promotions saying that the online version takes less than 10 minutes..  ""We all spend far more time checking out what we're going to watch on Netflix or purchasing something from Amazon,"" Wuori said. ""So it's really simple. It's formulated for whether you're getting on it by computer, by smartphone, on your tablet. It just automatically adjusts to whatever device you are using. And it is super simple."".  ©2020 Rockford Register Star, Ill.

776,"Tuesday marks the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, which celebrates of the cultures and honors the contributions of Hispanic and Latino Americans..  In Chicago, the Latino community makes up about one-third of the city. Their contributions have been integral to not just the Latino community, but the city at large..   In honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, the Chicago Latino Theater Alliance (CLATA) is producing an event this week — and it’s already sold out..  “Our event on September 17, to celebrate Latino Heritage Month, as I like to call it, is already sold out and we are doing it because we produced a Chicago Latino International Film Festival for the last three years, and due to COVID we had no choice but to go in open air,” said Myrna Salazar, co-founder and executive director of CLATA..  The event, Destinos al Aire, is being produced in collaboration with the National Museum of Mexican Art , International Latino Cultural Center and Puerto Rican Arts Alliance . The drive-in, live outdoor show at ChiTown Movies in Pilsen includes a screening of "" American Curious "" and performances. It will also be streamed live on Facebook ..  Beyond arts and culture, Hispanic Heritage Month recognizes the contributions Hispanic and Latino community members have made across the city, state and country..  “The Latino business community in the state of Illinois contributes $15 billion to the economy in spending power,” said Jaime di Paulo, CEO of the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce . “We have around 120,000 businesses Latino businesses or firms in the state of Illinois, and we also create about 100,000 jobs.”.  Meanwhile, it’s both an election year and a census year..  Jaime Dominguez, an assistant professor of political science at Northwestern University, said representation in the government is important..  “Latinos have grown politically, I would say substantially in particular over the last 20 years,” Dominguez said. “Prior to that, I would argue that Chicago was basically seen as a Black, white governing city.”.  That’s not the case anymore, Dominguez said. The population has grown, as has representation in City Council and the state legislature..  “It’s very, very important that Latinos have a voice and a space when it comes to city governance, particularly on issues that are very important to the city, but specific to Latinos, such as the issue of early education, immigration reform, better policing around our communities,” Dominguez said..  And there’s also the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected the Latino community — including its businesses..  “The data shows that we’re going to lose about a third of our businesses,” di Paulo said. The Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce is preparing to roll out technical assistance for businesses..  “They’re a key component to society. We feel like if a business closes down in our neighborhood, the neighborhood goes away. Our businesses are the heart of our communities,” he said.","[0.5108968615531921, 0.48910319805145264]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5108968615531921

July 18, 2020.  SIOUX FALLS, South Dakota – Iowa, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Nebraska will share state driver license information with the Census Bureau to help the federal government determine the citizenship status of its residents..  Until recently, Nebraska was the only state that had signed an agreement with the Census Bureau to send you the information..  Census takers will visit homes in rural areas that have not responded to the Census as of August 11..  Last year, President Donald Trump ordered the office to collect citizenship data from federal and state files after the Supreme Court rejected his attempt to include a question about citizenship in the 2020 census..  The vast majority of states have refused to share information about driver’s licenses and identity cards..  The governors of the four cooperating states are Republicans. The information first appeared through the public broadcaster NPR..  Latino participation in the 2020 Census has been very low in some areas because some say they fear for their information. Here we tell you what experts say about it..  Opponents of the measure fear state and municipal governments will use the information to redesign constituencies with only citizens in mind rather than the entire population..  This would benefit, they say, Republican candidates and non-Hispanic whites..  Vehicle agency information is often unreliable as legal residents have no reason to inform them when they become citizens, said Thomas Saenz, president and legal advisor to the United States Legal and Educational Defense Fund..  Pastors across the United States recognize the importance of being counted and have not hesitated to join the effort..  This body is one of several civil rights advocacy groups that have challenged Trump’s order in federal court in Maryland..  “Their task is to create a national database, so if only three relatively small states give them their files, that doesn’t get them too close to their goal,” said Saenz..  “I don’t know what they get out of it, but if I was in one of those states I would be upset if the state disclosed my information without asking my permission.”.  The Census Bureau estimates that in about 25 years, Hispanics and African Americans will be the majority in the United States. To see more of Telemundo, visit now.telemundo.com.  The Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, said it has enough information to determine the citizenship of nearly 90% of the United States population and that the information gathered from the order would help complete the picture..  The agreement with South Carolina, signed this month, allows the sharing of information that will be used “to fulfill legitimate functions of government agencies,” Julie Roy, spokeswoman for the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles, said in an email..  South Dakota signed its agreement with the Census Bureau in April, pledging to supply monthly information on driver’s licenses, including names, addresses, dates of birth, and citizenship. The state requires proof of citizenship or legal residence to obtain a driver’s license..  Telemundo and NALEO want to encourage the participation of Hispanics..  The information is used “for statistical purposes only” and not to enforce programs or other administrative functions, according to the agreement..  The agreements with Iowa and South Carolina contain similar language and limit states’ leeway to share information with other agencies..  The South Dakota Department of Public Safety did not respond to requests for comment..  Iowa began sharing its information with the Census in March. Also in that state only citizens or foreigners with residence permits can take out a license or an identity card, and citizenship is not listed in their information..  Democrats in the House of Representatives introduced a bill that would overturn Trump’s order to collect information on citizenship..  They say that the idea of ​​finding out people’s citizenship came from Thomas Hofeller, a Republican cadre that proposed creating constituencies using only voting-age citizens and not the entire population..  In documents that came to light after his death in 2018, he admitted that the goal was to favor Republicans..  The Census is held every ten years and helps decide how 1,500 million dollars is allocated in federal funds and how many seats each state has in the lower house..  Democrats say the citizenship information is part of a Trump administration effort to politicize the Census Bureau..  Many residents of immigrant communities expressed fear of filling out the census form, and agreements with states indicate Trump is trying to circumvent the Supreme Court ruling, according to Taneeza Islam, an immigration attorney who heads an organization called South Dakota Voices for Peace. ..  “Many people do not want to fill out government forms and this increases mistrust,” he said.

780,"(The Center Square) – The clock is ticking for Illinois lawmakers to put a proposal on the November ballot asking voters to approve a change to how legislative maps are drawn, but session days continue to be canceled amid a viral pandemic..  A few years ago, a citizen led initiative received nearly 600,000 signatures for a ballot initiative looking to create an independent commission to draw legislative maps instead of the boundaries being crafted by politicians. That was challenged by an attorney close to longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan and thrown off the ballot..  “Citizen initiatives always get challenged,” said a spokesperson for the Illinois State Board of Elections. “There wouldn’t be a legal challenge for a legislative initiative … They can put anything they want on the ballot.”.  One measure in the state Senate, Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 18, has bipartisan support..  “If you don’t do it now, this happens every ten years, right,” said state Sen. Melinda Bush, D-Grayslake. She’s a sponsor of SJRCA18..  “We redo our maps based on population,” she said. “It happens every ten years. This is the time to do it.”.  States are required to redraw their Congressional and legislative maps every 10 years, after new U.S. Census data is released, to account for population changes and migration..  State Sen. Jason Plummer, R-Vandalia, is also a sponsor of the measure. He said with the Census set for this year, the time is now..  “This is the year to do it and there’s a bipartisan group of folks working towards it,” Plummer said. “It seems like a lot of good things are lining up. And the governor has said he would only sign a map that is fair and I hope he honors his word.”.  Bush said there is a lot of support, but there may be political considerations as well. She said other states that have made a more fair process haven’t seen that..  “They did it in California and it didn’t cause them to elect less members of the party that was controlling the map,” Bush said. “So fair maps doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to change the number of representatives that you have in one party or another, it just makes it fair so that people are really being electing, and I think you get better representation that way.”.  One problem critics of the current map-making process have is districts are drawn to favor political parties, which leads to a lack of competition for voters to choose from..  If put on the ballot and approved by voters, SJRCA18 would establish an independent, 17-member commission appointed by the Illinois Supreme Court to draw the Congressional and General Assembly maps. Members would be nominated by each political party and cannot be sitting elected officials or their employees. Three of the members couldn’t have any political affiliation. The measure also allows the public to provide comments during the process..  The Illinois State Board of Elections says the deadline for lawmakers to pass a measure to get on the November ballot for voters to decide is May 4..

784,"Illinois homes sales and prices head higher in February.  SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — The Illinois housing market in February continued to outpace the year before with increases in both home sales and median prices despite lower inventory, data from Illinois REALTORS® shows..  Statewide home sales (including single-family homes and condominiums) in February totaled 8,725 homes sold, up 5.0 % from 8,307 in February 2019..  The statewide median price in February was $199,000, up 7.0 % from February 2019, when the median price was $186,000. The median is a typical market price where half the homes sold for more and half sold for less..  “The Illinois housing market continued to make solid gains in February with increases in home sales and median prices,” said Ed Neaves, president of Illinois REALTORS® and designated managing broker of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Snyder Real Estate in Bloomington. “That said, the real estate industry will be monitoring the impact of COVID-19 as consumers and REALTORS® take public safety precautions during this time.”.  The time it took to sell a home in January averaged 68 days, unchanged from the year before. Available inventory totaled 45,653 homes for sale, an 8.5 percent decline from 49,916 homes in February 2019..  According to the data, home sales in the Rockford MSA (Boone and Winnebago counties) totaled 279 units, a 15.8 percent increase while the median price was up 2.0 percent to $119,900; home sales in the Moline-Rock Island MSA (Henry, Mercer and Rock Island counties) totaled 135, a 4.7 % increase while the median price increased 3.8 % to $96,500..  The monthly average commitment rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.47 % in February, a decrease from 3.62 percent the previous month, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. In February 2019, it averaged 4.37 %..  In the nine-county Chicago Metro Area, home sales (single-family and condominiums) in February totaled 6,057, up 6.6 % from February 2019 sales of 5,680 homes. The median price in February was $240,000 in the Chicago Metro Area, an increase of 4.3 % from $230,000 in February 2019..  “The forecasts were prepared using data prior to the stock market meltdown and the increased concern about the impact of the COVID-19 virus pandemic,” said Geoffrey J.D. Hewings, director of the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory at the University of Illinois. “Absent these events, the housing market would have continued its slow but steady rebound. In times past, consumers have become very risk averse when faced with uncertainties about the economy. The difference with the current crisis is the limitations on interactions and fear of infection. This may prove to have a very significant impact on the housing market over the next two to three months.”.  The city of Chicago saw year-over-year home sales increase 1.6 percent with 1,472 sales in February, compared to 1,449 a year ago. The median price of a home in the city of Chicago in February was $290,000 up 6.4 percent compared to February 2019 when it was $272,500..  “As we ease into what should have been the beginning of the spring home buying and selling season, the data reflects that consumers are being deliberate in their spending,” said Maurice Hampton, president of the Chicago Association of REALTORS® and owner of Centered International Realty. “Median sales are on the up while inventory and days on the market both declined, showing that buyers are active in their search.”.  Sales and price information are generated by Multiple Listing Service closed sales reported by 26 participating Illinois REALTORS® local boards and associations including Midwest Real Estate Data LLC data as of March 7, 2020 for the period Feb. 1 through Feb. 29, 2020. The Chicago Metro Area, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, includes the counties of Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will..  Illinois REALTORS® is a voluntary trade association whose more than 50,000 members are engaged in all facets of the real estate industry. In addition to serving the professional needs of its members, Illinois REALTORS® works to protect the rights of private property owners in the state by recommending and promoting legislation to safeguard and advance the interest of real property ownership..

785,"By Jackson Elliott Medill Reports Chicago’s high real estate prices and the lack of buyers might indicate a housing market bubble, one real estate agent said..  Anthony Zammit, a 17-year industry veteran and the CEO of Lofty Real Estate, said that the slow market might be a sign of over-inflated real estate prices, especially given that half of Illinois residents want to leave the state, according to a 2014 Gallup poll..  “We’re in a pretty strong market and people in the last five years are making money and working, so people are buying,” he said, adding that great economic conditions don’t last forever..  Chicago residents may struggle to find a buyer, but most people have been able to sell their house for the price they ask, according to data from Redfin real estate company. However, buyers haven’t been willing to pay more for a house than the asking price..  Compared to other major American cities, Chicago homes spend the longest time on the market before selling and sell above their asking price least often, Redfin found. Still, only 15% of Chicago homes sell for lower than their listed price..  Zammit said that high taxes in the southern suburbs make them hardest to sell in the Chicagoland area. On a $150,000 house there, homeowners pay between $7,500 and $9,500 in taxes per year, he said. The average household in the south suburbs earns a little over $52,000 a year, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau..  “It’s not even worth buying property down there,” he said, adding that the state’s high property taxes overall were the reason for Illinois’s population loss. Only New Jersey has higher property taxes than Illinois..  “Chicagoland is going to be more expensive than Springfield. But the taxes here are insane,” he said..  However, Illinois real estate prices have remained high so far despite the state’s shrinking population said Zammit. From 2014 to 2019, Illinois lost over 157,000 residents, according to US Census Bureau figures..  Zammit said the market hasn’t been worse only because of a strong national economy. Millennials, who haven’t lived through better housing markets, also keep the Chicago market higher. They often buy Chicago properties that older house buyers won’t purchase, he said..  “People are making money right now, and a lot of millennials don’t know any other real estate market. The slow market affects our people who are 35 to 40 and over,” he said..  The same trend of high prices coupled with lower demand can be seen in Chicago rents. Over half of Chicago’s population rents houses, Zammit said. A weak housing market might be part of the reason why rents have risen..  “If the housing market is having a bad time, rentals will go up or stay the same because of demand,” he said. “The less people are buying, the more people are renting, and that generally drives up prices.”.  To fix high rents some people have suggested rent controls but that would only make the city’s housing problems worse, Zammit said..  “Developers aren’t going to come in because the price of the property is still going to go up, taxes are still going to go up, but the rent is staying the same,” he said..  Although the S & P 500 has dropped 20% for the first time in a decade as of March 12 when concerns over the coronavirus hit, Zammit said the real estate market has been more immune to the disease panic so far. Unlike companies on the stock market, properties can’t go bankrupt..  “Investors are still going to invest,” he said. “You can always recoup your costs in real estate.” Photo at top: As people leave Illinois, the state’s real estate market may face challenges.

On a $150,000 house there, homeowners pay between $7,500 and $9,500 in taxes per year, he said. The average household in the south suburbs earns a little over $52,000 a year, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau..  “It’s not even worth buying property down there,” he said, adding that the state’s high property taxes overall were the reason for Illinois’s population loss. Only New Jersey has higher property taxes than Illinois..  “Chicagoland is going to be more expensive than Springfield. But the taxes here are insane,” he said..  However, Illinois real estate prices have remained high so far despite the state’s shrinking population said Zammit. From 2014 to 2019, Illinois lost over 157,000 residents, according to US Census Bureau figures..  Zammit said the market hasn’t been worse only because of a strong national economy. Millennials, who haven’t lived through better housing markets, also keep the Chicago market higher. They often buy Chicago properties that older house buyers won’t purchase, he said..  “People are making money right now, and a lot of millennials don’t know any other real estate market. The slow market affects our people who are 35 to 40 and over,” he said..  The same trend of high prices coupled with lower demand can be seen in Chicago rents. Over half of Chicago’s population rents houses, Zammit said. A weak housing market might be part of the reason why rents have risen..  “If the housing market is having a bad time, rentals will go up or stay the same because of demand,” he said. “The less people are buying, the more people are renting, and that generally drives up prices.”.  To fix high rents some people have suggested rent controls but that would only make the city’s housing problems worse, Zammit said..  “Developers aren’t going to come in because the price of the property is still going to go up, taxes are still going to go up, but the rent is staying the same,” he said..  Although the S & P 500 has dropped 20% for the first time in a decade as of March 12 when concerns over the coronavirus hit, Zammit said the real estate market has been more immune to the disease panic so far. Unlike companies on the stock market, properties can’t go bankrupt..  “Investors are still going to invest,” he said. “You can always recoup your costs in real estate.” Photo at top: As people leave Illinois, the state’s real estate market may face challenges.

787,"By Jackson Elliott Medill Reports Chicago’s high real estate prices and the lack of buyers might indicate a housing market bubble, one real estate agent said..

The Illinois Secure Choice program has attracted 32,000 participants and $8.5 million in retirement savings assets in its first year of business, Illinois Treasurer Michael W. Frerichs reported Monday..  Illinois was the first state to authorize a private-sector retirement savings program under a law enacted in 2015. It requires employers in business for at least two years and with at least 25 employees to either offer a retirement savings plan or participate in Secure Choice..  Employees are defaulted in at a 5% contribution rate to a Roth IRA account, which they can change, or they can opt out of the program..  The program was rolled out in phases, with employers with 500 or more employees required to register by Nov. 1, 2018, and smaller employers with between 25 and 99 workers registering by Nov. 1, 2019, for a total of 4,691 businesses participating..  The investment accounts are portable, with four investment fund options . The program is managed by Ascensus ..  Mr. Frerichs said in a statement that 47% of Illinois private-sector workers do not have access to a workplace retirement savings plan. ""Everyone should have the opportunity to retire with dignity. Secure Choice allows workers to save their own money and protects employers from the federal regulatory burden that often accompanies such plans,"" said Mr. Frerichs, who as Illinois' chief investment and banking officer, actively manages $31 billion..  Oregon launched the first Secure Choice program, which is expected to be available for more than 1 million Oregon-based workers when fully implemented in 2020. The third — and largest — state-sponsored retirement program opened for business July 1 in California for an estimated 7.5 million eligible workers..

796,"Log in Sign up.  Frerichs and Gallo said a lack of private retirement accounts would be a burden on government safety net programs..  While the treasurer’s office and an appointed, unpaid board of advisors oversee the program, the money invested by Illinois workers goes straight to an account managed by Ascensus, an independent Pennsylvania-based financial services company that won the bid to administer the program..  That means employees opening the retirement accounts remain in complete control of their money and the state cannot use the funds for any other purpose. Enrollees in the program pay an annual fee of 0.75 percent of their invested money — a rate capped at that amount by state law..  Frerichs said more than 4,600 businesses that did not offer a retirement plan prior to joining Secure Choice registered for the program during its first year of implementation. He said letters have been sent to 29,000 businesses, and 10,000 of them have replied by either joining the program or informing the state they already offer a qualified plan..  “We will continue to work with the 19,000 non-responsive employers, helping them to become compliant so that they can also provide their workers with a retirement option,” he said. “We want people to know Secure Choice makes it easy for employees to save their own money, and it’s simple for employers to implement.”.  There are no fees for employers to become part of the plan, and statue prohibits employer contributions. Employers are required only to register on ilsecurechoice.com , enter employee information, and deduct and remit to the state the employee contributions from payroll..  While state law does provide for fines of $250 per employee for businesses that fail to comply with the law, the treasurer’s office said in September the goal is voluntary compliance and no fines have yet been levied..  Leonor Borja, representing Urban Alternatives property management company, said at the news conference she was initially skeptical of the program. She said those concerns were waylaid when an employee from Ascencus explained the program to her and her staff. ‘No bars, no restaurants:’ Marijuana trailer bill clarifies allowable public use in Illinois By JERRY NOWICKI Capitol News Illinois.  “So far, about a third of our employees are currently enrolled for it, which is more than what I would have imagined by now,” she said. “And some of them it was almost the first time they’re even thinking about saving.”.

797,"Illinois Early Voting: These Are All the Locations and Hours in 11 Chicago-Area Counties.  For his part, Trump has disparaged Chicago countless times over the last several years, using the city as a sort of stand-in for all Democratic politicians and policies..  Will those attacks cut even further into his vote share in Chicago? In 2016, Trump actually won the smallest proportion of the vote in a presidential race in Chicago in at least 50 years, just 12% - a share smaller even than either of Obama’s Republican opponents in 2008 and 2012. Trump was buoyed by higher margins in other parts of the state to win just under 39% of the total vote in Illinois, compared to Clinton’s 56%..  Statewide in 2016, Trump outperformed both Sen. John McCain’s 2008 and Sen. Bob Dole’s 1996 runs in Illinois by nearly 2 points and improved on George H.W. Bush’s 1992 Illinois result by more than 4 points. So while Trump performed historically poorly in Chicago, he ran stronger in the rest of Illinois than multiple Republican presidential candidates over the last few decades..  This year, in Illinois and across the nation, the battleground is in the suburbs. The 2018 midterm elections were defined by suburban voters – including those in some major Congressional races in Illinois – abandoning the GOP in droves, giving Democrats an historic victory in the House. How will those same suburban voters, in areas long thought to be Republican strongholds, vote this election cycle when Trump himself is on the ballot?.  This sort of political reordering in Illinois – the urban center becoming increasingly liberal, rural areas turning more conservative and the suburbs backing Democrats, at least for now – is a fascinating microcosm of the overall realignment happening across the U.S. What’s happening politically in the nation is playing out on a smaller scale right here in our own backyard..  That could be in part because Illinois is, of all the states, relatively representative of the U.S. demographically, with similar proportions of people living in urban and rural areas as compared to the entire country (skewing just slightly more urban), as well as a racial makeup that mirrors the U.S. as a whole, according to the U.S. Census Bureau : roughly 60% white, 18% Hispanic or Latino, 15% Black and 6% Asian, among others..  A 2016 NPR analysis found that based on five demographic indicators, Illinois is the state that is the most like the U.S. on a smaller scale – an evaluation Pritzker shared in 2020 as he voiced his support for Illinois to be the first in the nation to vote in primary elections..  That analysis noted that Illinois, though recently thought to be a Democratic state, has a long history of electing Republicans and has a presidential election record that is “more accurate than partisan,” voting for the winner of every 20th century presidential election except two..  This year, no matter how the votes shake out in each part of the state, we can say with some certainty that Illinois’ 20 electoral votes will go to Biden. If the suburbs again break for Democrats like they did in 2018, and as Biden leads Trump in multiple nationwide polls, some by double-digit margins, is he poised to win Illinois by the largest margin in modern history?.  That title currently belongs to Obama’s 25-point home state victory over McCain in 2008. While there were more ballots cast in Illinois in 2016’s presidential race than in 2008, third-party candidates (including Gary Johnson, who was endorsed by the Chicago Tribune) earned nearly 300,000 votes. That was more than 5% of the total vote and more than four times as much as the third-party candidates in 2008 had received..  While there are four candidates other than Biden and Trump on the ballot in Illinois this year, there’s little evidence to believe any might play as significant a role both in the state and nationwide. The third-party candidates on the Illinois ballot include: Howie Hawkins for the Green Party, Gloria La Riva for the Party for Socialism and Liberation, Brian Carroll for the American Solidarity Party and Jo Jorgenson for the Libertarian Party..  And if Illinois isn’t dramatic enough – Democrats call it the “firewall” for the party in the Midwest – the nationwide race for president may be decided just next door in Michigan and Wisconsin..  Both of Illinois’ neighbors broke for Trump by miniscule margins in 2016, Michigan by .2% and Wisconsin by .7%, handing him 16 and 10 electoral votes, respectively. This year, Democrats are hoping to take both states back as they look to rebuild a coalition in the heartland..  So while the results of the presidential race in Illinois are all but decided, that doesn’t mean there will be any shortage of high-stakes drama this November – both in the state and just across the border.

HSI has been on the West Side for 40 plus years. I could not have picked an organization that is more deserving. We cannot thank Sherman Dodge and BMO Harris Bank enough. - Larry Huggins SKOKIE, Ill. (PRWEB) October 09, 2020 Chicago Football Classic, Inc., in collaboration with Sherman Dodge car dealership, located at 7601 N. Skokie Blvd., donated a 16-seat passenger van to Habilitative Systems, Inc. (HSI), on Thursday, August 20, via a press conference. During the press conference, the group handed over a set of keys and a brand-new van to the non-profit organization, which specializes as a human service agency based on Chicago’s West Side. “[We] will use the van to reach more of Chicago’s under served residents,” said Donald Dew, President and CEO of HSI. “And support Counting on Chicago Coalition’s efforts to encourage undercounted communities to fill out the 2020 census.” According to Dew’s website, HSI was founded in 1978 by Larry T. Byrd and a group of concerned West Side Chicago residents. Byrd was the organization’s first executive director, where he served until his untimely death in 1989. Dew has led the organization since 1990. The agency began by operating several programs previously managed by an affiliate of Claire Christian United Methodist Church, located at Pulaski Road and 15th Street, in the heart of the North Lawndale community. The early programs included Drake House Group Home for Adolescent Boys, Wesley Workshop, a sheltered employment facility for the disabled, and an outpatient substance abuse treatment center. HSI has grown at a phenomenal rate over the years, largely by taking over the operations of other West Side agencies, including West Side Parents of Exceptional Children Special School. In 1984, HSI began operating an early intervention program, along with the Garfield and St. Timothy day care centers, which were previously operated by Christian Action Ministry. Larry Huggins, co-founder of Chicago Football Classic Inc., said he was very proud to pick HSI as the award-winning organization for the 16-seat passenger van. “HSI has been on the West Side for 40 plus years,” said Huggins. “I could not have picked an organization that is more deserving. We cannot thank Sherman Dodge and BMO Harris Bank enough.” Huggins attributed these life-changing scholarship awards and contributions of the Chicago Football Classic’s past two events to the organization’s generous sponsors and donors. Huggins said that in spite of the 2020 Football Classic being canceled this year, the group continues to step up “big” in the clutch. Huggins stated via a press release that the ability to be able to continue this type of financial support is critical during these times, given the economic toll the virus has had on African-American families and communities. Huggins also mentioned that many African-American families are struggling to send their kids to college and make ends meet. In addition to strong contributions from Huggins and the CFC, David Dickens, owner of Sherman Dodge dealership, also donated a 2018 Jeep Wrangler Sahara to the Chicago Football Classic organization.

They are looking for ""patterns of property market excesses"" which would manifest as ""a decoupling of prices from local incomes and rents, and imbalances in the real economy, such as excessive lending and construction activity."".  They ranked 25 global housing markets and categorized them into 5 different buckets depending on their index/ bubble risk levels as shown below. Notice that Chicago is actually the only city in the undervalued bucket. Chicago remains the most undervalued housing market among 25 major global cities.  The report notes that the majority of the high bubble risk cities are in Europe and they attribute that to the fact that Europe has exceptionally low interest rates. The report also notes that population shifts out of urban centers could spell trouble for some of the global cities..  The graph below shows how the 5 US cities have trended over time. None of them are currently categorized as bubble risks, though 3 are overvalued and Boston is almost overvalued. Although all 5 cities tended to trend together over much of this time frame Chicago definitely went on its own undervalued path after the housing bubble burst. Starting around 2009 Chicago home prices started to fall behind other major US cities and became undervalued.  The UBS report is not that optimistic about future price appreciation in Chicago but they do highlight just how affordable the city is:.  With the city highly indebted, employment growth depressed, and the population declining, a turnaround is unlikely in the near future. However, affordability remains intact, as incomes are keeping pace with the slow price increases. A skilled worker needs only three years of income to be able to afford a 60 square meter (650 square foot) flat near the city center – the lowest figure among all cities included in the study..  Chicago's low price to income ratio, along with the low price to rent ratio, are two factors that play a big role in Chicago standing out as affordable and with a low risk of being in a real estate bubble..  #ChicagoHomePrices #HousingBubble #BubbleIndex #ChicagoRealEstate.

801,"One Illinois Daily Debunk: When taxes entice residents Good schools attract new residents, and what’s one of the main keys to public education? Students gather outdoors at social distance over the summer at New Trier High School. (Facebook) By Ted Cox Anti-taxers like to insist that residents “vote with their feet” when it comes to taxation. We’ve already debunked that to a large extent, pointing repeatedly to a study by the Better Government Association finding that, when Illinois raised taxes on all residents a decade ago, it was low-income workers bearing an unfair share of the tax burden who were forced to leave the state, while more well-to-do Illinoisans stayed and prospered. But a recent opinion piece in Bloomberg News caught our eye, because it looked at the tax-residence dynamic from the opposite angle. Stephen Mihm’s article “ Low Taxes Are Never Enough to Attract Wealthy Residents ” basically debunked a 62-year-old study by Charles Tiebout that has proved incredibly influential in bolstering that “vote with their feet” argument. Mihm pointed out that Tiebout himself had qualms about his methodology, citing: “In a footnote, he even acknowledged that he was proposing an ‘extreme model,’ where residents chose to put all their worldly possessions into a moving truck with the same carefree calculation that they brought to the purchase of pork chops.” We’ve cited that repeatedly ourselves, with studies finding that millionaires — like many fellow Illinoisans who choose to stay put — are held by the contacts they’ve made , the places they’ve settled in, and especially the business contacts that in large part provide their livelihood. But all right, let’s allow that occasionally anyone is apt to pull up stakes and move. In that case, where do they go? What draws them somewhere else? Turns out, in Mihm’s findings, it’s not low taxes. It’s the value residents derive from the taxes they pay — especially when it comes to good schools. As he put it: “Yes, Tiebout’s ‘consumer voters’ will factor in state income tax and local property-tax burdens when considering a move. But the actual goods and services gained by moving — you know, those things paid for with taxes — also played a constructive role in their decisions.” Mihm looked to how “a state like Massachusetts, which has very high taxes but the highest-rated public schools, isn’t losing population,” while “states like Mississippi, which has low taxes but poor school systems, are suffering an exodus.” It’s no different in Illinois. Where are the most valued home tracts in Illinois (sometimes with the highest property taxes)? The suburbs of Chicago. And it’s no coincidence that also happens to be where many of the state’s top school districts are. When Chicago was suffering family flight in the ‘90s and aughts, the primary way Mayor Richard M. Daley combated that was by building top-rated high schools, a process continued by his successor Mayor Rahm Emanuel, with the result that Chicago now dominates the list of the very best public high schools in the state — a powerful draw for new residents, no matter Chicago’s numerous other problems. Good schools draw residents, something One Illinois has heard repeatedly from our first days, from politicians like Mayor Chris Lain of Savanna . And what’s one of the primary keys to good schools, including public universities? Adequate funding provided by adequate taxation, something Illinois public schools haven’t had for decades. Although we’re trying. Because that’s the other dynamic Mihm pointed out, citing how critics of Thiebout’s study found that, in the face of heavy taxation and inefficient government, “households vote far more often with heads and hands than their feet.” In other words, they get involved politically and demand change. And that’s exactly what happened three years ago when the General Assembly overrode then-Gov. Rauner’s veto to raise taxes to support a new “evidence-based” funding formula for public education. The goals of that change were simple: to restore the state to its assigned constitutional role of being the “primary” funder of public education, to balance the scales so that it’s not just well-to-do suburbs with high property values that provide good schools, but every district across the state. And we’re not there yet. Voters voted with their heads and hands, not their feet, two years ago in electing Gov. Pritzker under a platform of passing a progressive income tax to adequately fund education and other essential social services “hollowed out” by decades of insufficient funding. The General Assembly elected two years ago endorsed that by a 60 percent supermajority to alter the state constitution to end the requirement of a regressive flat tax and allow a graduated income tax, and now as required by law it goes before the voters in need of the same supermajority for final adoption. It’s what’s needed to make Illinois a better state and, as it logically follows, a more desirable destination.

802,"There are just 36 affordable units available for every 100 extremely low-income renters Terrace 459 is an award-winning affordable-housing development in Chicago on the former site of the Cabrini-Green projects. (One Illinois/Ted Cox) By Ted Cox Illinois has just 36 affordable housing units available for every 100 extremely low-income renters, according to a new study released Tuesday by advocacy groups. The National Low Income Housing Coalition and Housing Action Illinois released the study, “ The Gap: A Shortage of Affordable Homes ,” which found that, as a result of the shortage, 71 percent of the poorest renter households in the state are “severely housing cost-burdened,” meaning they spend more than half of their income on housing. “Far too many families in Illinois are spending more than 50 percent of their income on housing, living on the brink,” said Sharon Legenza, executive director of Housing Action Illinois. “They’re forced to choose between necessities like medicine and groceries or paying the rent. They’re just one financial setback away from eviction and homelessness.” The groups defined extremely low-income renters as “those with incomes at or below the poverty line, or 30 percent of their area median income.” There are an estimated 450,000 ELI renter households statewide, and according to the study the shortage is even more dire in the Chicago metro area, where there are just 31 affordable units for every 100 ELI renters. The national study found Illinois to be reflective of the Midwest, with between 30 and 40 units available for every 100 ELI renters. The crisis was more pressing in the major Southern and Western states of Florida, Texas, and California, all of which had fewer than 30 affordable units available for every 100 ELI residents. According to the Illinois group’s Policy Director Bob Palmer, the state House Revenue and Finance Committee has a meeting set for Wednesday in Chicago that will take up a couple of proposals meant to expand affordable housing: one that would give developers and private realty firms a break on their property-tax assessments if they offer affordable housing, and another that would create a state companion program to the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit. They would “increase the supply of affordable housing one way or another,” Palmer said. According to a news release put out by the group on the new study, in 2016 “Illinois received more than $40 million for the HOME Program and nearly $346 million for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, both (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) programs that support the development of affordable housing. Illinois also received $926 million for the Housing Choice Voucher program, proven to reduce housing instability and homelessness while improving child and adult well-being.” The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that vouchers supported 94,500 Illinoisan households in 2018 — and many more than that qualify for the program without receiving assistance. The groups emphasized that the federal programs make an accurate 2020 U.S. Census count essential, because the state population determines the level of federal funding. “We need to count every single person in Illinois—and that includes renters, students, babies, non-citizens, people experiencing homelessness, and other populations that are hard to count,” Palmer said. “During the last census, one in every four Illinoisans went uncounted. We can’t afford to let that happen again. For each person who goes uncounted, we leave as much as $1,800 on the table. That’s money we need to build housing, assist low-income renter households, address homelessness, fix roads, put towards health care, and do so much more.” Ted Cox March 10, 2020","[0.7742335200309753, 0.22576647996902466]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.7742335200309753

Recent census estimates have shown Illinois has been losing population and is at risk of losing at least one of its 18 congressional seats..  Because of that, the Illinois General Assembly last year put $29 million in the state budget for IDHS to help ensure an accurate count. Hou said $20 million of that has already been distributed in each of the state’s 102 counties to work with local organizations to maximize the census count..  Hou said IDHS was tasked with implementing the census in Illinois because, as the state’s main social service agency, it deals directly with “hard-to-count” populations, including the homeless..

805,"Starting this week, every single Illinoisan will have a once-in-a-decade opportunity to help our state and local communities get the resources we need for proven programs that help end homelessness and expand affordable housing..  On March 12, the U.S. Census Bureau starts mailing invitations to fill out the census questionnaire. Everyone will have the chance to respond online, by phone or by mail. It shouldn’t take long; most people can finish it in about 10 minutes, and the impact of doing so will play out over the next 10 years. Advertisement.  That’s because the data collected by the 2020 census will determine how many legislators represent us in Congress — two seats are at stake in the count — and how much federal assistance Illinois receives for the next decade. We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that go toward a wide range of vital services, from building roads and bridges to providing health care to critical housing and homeless prevention programs..  The severity of Illinois’ affordable housing shortage underlines the need for these programs. Earlier this week, the National Low Income Housing Coalition and Housing Action Illinois co-released “The Gap,” a report showing that our state has just 36 affordable, available rental homes for every 100 extremely low income households. In order to address this shortage, we need to fully leverage federal programs that fuel the construction of more affordable units, prevent homelessness and assist with other foundational community needs..  Addressing this kind of complex, broad problem can sometimes feel overwhelming at the individual level. But filling out your census is a simple step you can take to help. Experts estimate that Illinois will lose as much as $1,800 per year for each person who doesn’t get counted. Multiply that by 10 years, and it’s $18,000 per non-counted person that gets left on the table and does not go toward these vital programs.

806,"Commentary: Let’s scrap Illinois and build New Illinois By Richard Porter Mar 11, 2020 | 4:39 PM (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Despite the many advantages that have made Illinois an important state and a desirable place to live, Illinois now has a population crisis: As its population shrinks, property values fall, and the burden of state liabilities and taxes increases exponentially, which in turn scares more people away..  The population crisis presents a major policy challenge: how to restructure and reduce increasing state and municipal debt, liabilities and taxes in order to make Illinois a place people want to move to once again. Advertisement There’s a lot of talk about an ‘Illinois exodus.’ We took a closer look at the reality behind the chatter. ».  Due to the pension protection clause in the Illinois Constitution, elected state officials cannot change the existing pension system to reduce liabilities, nor may Illinois declare bankruptcy and reduce liabilities in a proceeding under existing federal bankruptcy law..  However, Illinoisans need not despair, for we have a variety of options available to us by which a reform legislature could address the problems driving the Illinois exodus..  One option is a constitutional amendment to authorize modest reforms to pensions along with a series of municipal bankruptcies that would refresh local governments collapsing under excessive liabilities. A downside to this conventional path is the extended time and protracted conflict it entails; our population will continue to bleed out, and voters will grow weary over the years of constant conflict necessary to get the job done. Commentary: If Pritzker wants real pension reform, he may need to amend his ‘fantasy’ swipe ».  So while a protracted fight to fix Illinois is an option, we should consider instead starting fresh: a new state governed by an entirely new constitution..  This option may take less time to implement, avoid judicial roadblocks, provide more comprehensive relief and move creditor fights off the political center stage. Starting fresh potentially offers a swift and sure path to making our state attractive again..  While creating a new state to replace the old strikes some as laughable, creating new entities to replace old entities is a bankruptcy reorganization technique used in commercial cases. For example, the federal government set up a new corporation in the GM bankruptcy that “purchased” assets and assumed certain selected liabilities from old GM. The new company that emerged from bankruptcy was reformed and had fewer liabilities — and was swiftly able to compete in the car and truck market again. Old GM’s creditors who were left behind in bankruptcy court divvied up the proceeds from New GM’s purchase, and their unsatisfied claims were ultimately extinguished. In the meantime, New GM’s business was not bogged down in the ongoing creditor squabbling. The U.S. Constitution includes three provisions that form the legal basis for a “new state, old state” reorganization of Illinois: the bankruptcy clause, the guarantee clause and the authorization of Congress to admit new states out of the territory of existing states..  Congress has the power to pass laws on the subject of bankruptcy in Article I, which Congress exercises by periodically changing and extending the Bankruptcy Code. While states are prohibited from impairing contracts, the federal government can and does impair contracts through bankruptcy laws. [Most read] Coronavirus in Illinois updates: Here’s what’s happening Thursday with COVID-19 in the Chicago area ».  Article IV provides, “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican form of government.” On this basis, the federal government restructured southern states after the Civil War. While the federal government hasn’t yet restructured an overly indebted state, if a state is run by creditors for the benefit of creditors instead of the people, the people of that state have a constitutional basis for seeking federal relief from creditors in order to assure government serves its citizens, instead of squeezing them..  Article IV also provides a two-step process for creating a new state out of an old state: The legislature passes a constitution for the new state and, if Congress consents, a new state is formed and admitted to the union, and the jurisdiction of the old state is correspondingly reduced. While several states have been created out of the territory of existing states (e.g., West Virginia from Virginia), this process has not yet been utilized to replace an entire state; however, the plain words and logic of the Constitution make replacing a state possible (and perhaps even an obligation)..  The first step — approving a new constitution and petitioning Congress to create a new state — requires a simple majority vote of the state legislature. With a reform majority in the legislature, the new state’s constitution could be designed to make New Illinois an appealing place to live by protecting our property values and enhancing opportunities for our people. For example, the new constitution could include limits on property, income and sales taxes; limits on incurring debt; limits on government spending; as well as reforms and modernizations to municipal governance structures.

After weeks of health officials' admonitions that people who feel sick should stay home from work or school, Pritzker was asked in Springfield last Friday what advice he had for hourly workers and those who generally don't qualify for paid sick leave..  “It would be great if people have sick time, and they are sick, they need to stay home,” Pritzker said. “But I don't disagree with you that it would be a hardship for people, particularly those who are earning minimum wage or lower-income people, when they get sick, but you've got to look out for your health.”.  By Monday, he announced he was working on a plan to expand unemployment benefits for those forced to stay away from work. It was the same day that Illinois' major insurance companies announced they would fully cover costs of testing for the coronavirus after Pritzker met with them to urge relief..  The federal government must approve the details of the Illinois plan, but President Donald Trump this week also said he would seek relief for hourly workers forced to miss work..  Pritzker said Wednesday that he has also begun discussions with Major League Baseball and its Chicago franchise owners as the league's opening day, March 26, is the earliest ever. All 30 teams are scheduled to play that day, but athletic contests in Europe have been significantly altered by the coronavirus, forcing soccer and other teams to compete in empty arenas.

809,"Census Bureau in Chicago says Warsaw census response has been good.  The local community has been doing well in responding to the 2020 US Census..  That’s according to Ellisa Johnson, who is the Deputy Director of the US Census Bureau office in Chicago. Johnson joined Warsaw’s weekly COVID-19 press conference via phone on Wednesday, encouraging people to get the census done if you have not already..  She said that the national response rate to the census is 59.6 percent, but Indiana and Warsaw are ahead of that rate at 64.6 percent and 62.9 percent respectively. According to 2020census.gov, Kosciusko County as a whole is at 57.2 percent..  Johnson credited city officials and area census workers for their hard work to make sure the census has been getting done..  If you haven’t filled out the 2020 census yet, you still have plenty of time to do it. Johnson says the non-respondent period was pushed back to start at August 11th, meaning that a census taker will come to your door and talk to you about the census. That period will also go through October 31st..  Johnson says the 2020 census has been one of the easiest to complete with the easier methods. You can complete the census by calling 844-330-2020, going onto 2020census.gov or by completing the physical form that has been mailed to a residence..  The bureau will be physically bringing out 2,000 census packets to local residents this week.

812,"PDF pdf icon [134K].  Candida auris is an emerging fungal pathogen that is frequently drug-resistant; C. auris can be difficult to identify, and it has been associated with outbreaks in health care settings.* The first case of C. auris in Chicago, Illinois, was identified in May 2016 ( 1 ). Additional cases continue to be reported, particularly in high-acuity, postacute–care facilities ( 1 ), and spread of C. auris within this type of facility has been documented nationwide ( 2 ). To monitor local trends in the prevalence of C. auris , point prevalence surveys (PPSs) have been conducted in Chicago since August 2016 ( 1 ). In addition to C. auris , a high prevalence of carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) has also been described in Chicago long-term acute-care hospitals since 2010 ( 3 ). C. auris and CPOs can colonize persons over prolonged periods and, because of antimicrobial resistance, cause invasive infections with limited treatment options ( 2 , 3 ). Co-colonization with these organisms has been identified ( 4 ). Adults in long-term acute-care hospitals are at increased risk for acquiring C. auris and CPOs because of serious underlying medical conditions, extended lengths of stay, presence of indwelling medical devices, and frequent health care worker contact ( 3 , 4 ). As of June 2019, among residents of Chicago’s four long-term acute-care hospitals, the median prevalences of colonization with C. auris and CPO were 31% and 24%, respectively (Chicago Department of Public Health, personal communication, January 3, 2020). Although prevalence among adults is well characterized, prevalence of C. auris colonization has not been described among pediatric populations in Chicago, and limited data exist on CPO colonization among children outside of intensive care units ( 5 )..  To assess C. auris and CPO colonization among children, in August 2019, the Chicago Department of Public Health conducted a PPS in a 49-bed pediatric hospital providing long-term transitional care for patients leaving pediatric intensive care units. All hospitalized patients were included unless parental consent could not be obtained. Presence and type of medical devices (i.e., gastrostomy tubes, tracheostomies, mechanical ventilators, and central venous catheters) and lengths of stay were documented for all hospitalized patients. Specimens collected for testing consisted of composite bilateral axillary and inguinal swabs for C. auris and rectal swabs for CPO testing. The Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene tested all specimens. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used to detect C. auris DNA and the carbapenemase genes bla KPC , bla NDM , bla VIM , bla OXA-48 , and bla IMP (Xpert Carba-R Assay, Cepheid). All axillary and inguinal swabs were processed by real-time PCR and culture to identify C. auris . For CPOs, culture was attempted on real-time PCR-positive specimens. Among all 29 hospitalized patients, 25 (86%) were screened for C. auris and CPOs. Two rectal specimens were unsatisfactory and produced invalid CPO test results. Patient census was matched to the Illinois extensively drug resistant organism (XDRO) registry to identify previous reports of C. auris and CPO colonization or infection. Facility prevalence of C. auris and CPOs was calculated as the number of patients with a PPS-related specimen that was positive or a previous report of these organisms in the XDRO registry divided by the facility census count provided by the facility on the day of PPS..  Among the 29 hospitalized patients, median age was 1.2 years (range = 26 days–17.4 years; interquartile range [IQR] = 289 days–2.6 years), 26 (90%) had a gastrostomy tube, 24 (83%) had a tracheostomy, 20 (69%) required mechanical ventilation, and three (10%) had a central venous catheter. Median length of stay was 35 days (IQR = 13–71 days). No patient had a previous report of C. auris or CPO. No patient specimens were positive for C. auris , and a specimen from one patient was positive for bla OXA-48 , yielding a facility prevalence for CPOs of 3.4%. No organism was recovered from the specimen that tested positive for bla OXA-48 ..  This PPS is the first documented screening for C. auris colonization in a transitional care pediatric hospital in the United States. Despite a high prevalence of C. auris and CPOs among patients in adult health care settings of similar acuity in the region, C. auris was not identified and CPOs were rare at this pediatric hospital. Biannual assessment of this facility is planned. Because this PPS includes only one facility in a region, additional evaluations in similar pediatric health care settings need to be conducted to improve understanding of C. auris and CPO prevalence in this population.","[0.5055031180381775, 0.4944969415664673]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5055031180381775
813,"Chicago Football Classic, Inc., in collaboration with Sherman Dodge car dealership, located at 7601 N. Skokie Blvd., donated a 16-seat passenger van to Habilitative Systems, Inc. (HSI), on Thursday, August 20, via a press conference..  During the press conference, the group handed over a set of keys and a brand-new van to the non-profit organization, which specializes as a human service agency based on Chicago’s West Side. PRESIDENT AND CEO of HSI Donald Dew (at podium) thanks leaders of CFC and Sherman Dodge for the donation of a 16-passenger van. According to Dew, the van will assist the organization to reach more people in underserved communities with developmental disabilities, mental illness and substance abuse..  “[We] will use the van to reach more of Chicago’s underserved residents,” said Donald Dew, President and CEO of HSI. “And support Counting on Chicago Coalition’s efforts to encourage undercounted communities to fill out the 2020 census.”.  According to Dew’s website, HSI was founded in 1978 by Larry T. Byrd and a group of concerned West Side Chicago residents. Byrd was the organization’s first executive director, where he served until his untimely death in 1989. Dew has led the organization since 1990..  The agency began by operating several programs previously managed by an affiliate of Claire Christian United Methodist Church, located at Pulaski Road and 15th Street, in the heart of the North Lawndale community. PICTURED IN SKOKIE, Illinois, on the lot of the Sherman Dodge dealership are officials from Chicago Football Classic Inc., Sherman Dodge and Habilitative Systems Inc. at the Aug. 20 presentation of a 16-passenger van and a Jeep Wrangler..  The early programs included Drake House Group Home for Adolescent Boys, Wesley Workshop, a sheltered employment facility for the disabled, and an outpatient substance abuse treatment center..  HSI has grown at a phenomenal rate over the years, largely by taking over the operations of other West Side agencies, including West Side Parents of Exceptional Children Special School. In 1984, HSI began operating an early intervention program, along with the Garfield and St. Timothy day care centers, which were previously operated by Christian Action Ministry..  Larry Huggins, co-founder of Chicago Football Classic Inc., said he was very proud to pick HSI as the award-winning organization for the 16-seat passenger van. PICTURED HOLDING Certificates of Appreciation from HSI for donating a 16-seat passenger van to the organization is (l-r) CFC Co-Founder Larry Huggins and Sherman Dodge owner Dave Dickens..  “HSI has been on the West Side for 40 plus years,” said Huggins. “I could not have picked an organization that is more deserving. We cannot thank Sherman Dodge and BMO Harris Bank enough.”.  Huggins attributed these life-changing scholarship awards and contributions of the Chicago Football Classic’s past two events to the organization’s generous sponsors and donors. Huggins said that in spite of the 2020 Football Classic being canceled this year, the group continues to step up “big” in the clutch..  Huggins stated via a press release that the ability to be able to continue this type of financial support is critical during these times, given the economic toll the virus has had on African-American families and communities. Huggins also mentioned that many African-American families are struggling to send their kids to college and make ends meet..  In addition to strong contributions from Huggins and the CFC, David Dickens, owner of Sherman Dodge dealership, also donated a 2018 Jeep Wrangler Sahara to the Chicago Football Classic organization. The Jeep was raffled off to help raise funds for the CFC Scholarship Fund..  “We are so excited to be a part of this,” said Dickens. “The real heroes are Larry Huggins, Everett Rand and Donald Dew. We are so proud to be a small part of it. Thank you!”.  “We are here for an opportunistic event,” said Everett Rand, co-founder of the Chicago Football Classic. “This is our sixth year of raffling off the vehicle.

814,"Chicago Tribune | Aug 27, 2020 at 5:00 AM Gov. J.B. Pritzker appears at the University of Chicago's Harper Center on July 23, 2020. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Gov. J.B. Pritzker wants you to trust him. He and his fellow Democrats are pushing their “fair tax” proposal on the November ballot. And they promise that if you vote “yes,” they’ll only take from the rich, not the middle class. They’re spinning the story on video ads that Pritzker is paying for, and in the media. And here’s the spin: If you vote for Pritzker’s “fair tax” amendment, and change the state constitution to abolish the current flat tax, there’s no way they’ll use their new “progressive” tax to reach down into the middle class and grab middle-class money. Advertisement No way. They promise. Trust them. Who wouldn’t trust Pritzker? And just look at House Speaker Michael Madigan, the Democratic Party boss of Illinois, smiling impishly, even with all that federal heat on him and the FBI’s big federal bus rolling back and forth between Springfield and Chicago. Who wouldn’t trust Boss Madigan? Isn’t trust everything? Advertisement Some of you want to trust them. I get it. They’re powerful people, and Illinoisans have been trained to bow and scrape before their lords. Besides, I bet that some who believe they’ll only tax the rich also want to believe that someday, they might have tiny purple unicorns as pets. But the problem is reality — and a series of excellent Chicago Tribune editorials on broken promises from the political class in Springfield. My favorite Springfield promises include the one about how the Illinois tollways will become freeways, and another about how the Illinois Lottery will fund the schools. There are more. Trust me. The problem with the Pritzker “fair tax” promise is that there aren’t enough rich people in the state to pay all the outrageous debt and the bills that the bipartisan political class has put on the backs of state taxpayers. And if the rich leave the state, which they will because they have the money to leave, what happens to those who are stuck here? It reminds me of the Matt Damon movie “Rounders” about card sharks and gambling. Damon’s character tells another guy an eternal truth that also applies to government: “Listen, here’s the thing. If you can’t spot the sucker in the first half-hour at the table, then you are the sucker.” You don’t have 30 minutes to figure it out. I’ll just give you until the end of the column to spot the sucker. And don’t cheat by looking in the mirror. But as you ponder, consider other gifts you’ve been given by Illinois politicians. Illinois businesses have been getting crushed lately through Pritzker’s off-and-on shutdowns due to the coronavirus. Many businesses and the jobs they once offered are gone, never to return. In the cities, this means that commercial real estate values will drop, but also that the tax revenue those cities were counting on will drop. Government never makes cuts. This is Illinois. Who do you think picks up the slack? On top of that, consider the state debt. The state estimates taxpayers owe at least $137 billion in unfunded public pension liabilities, but Moody’s Investors Service puts that debt closer to $240 billion . This is money owed for the retirements of public sector workers. Many of their unions work to elect Democrats, and while they’re out politicking this year, I wonder if they’ll also help collect mail-in ballots containing votes on the Pritzker tax through an activity called ballot harvesting. Politicians promise generous retirement benefits to the unions, and the unions work the precincts to elect the politicians, some of whom use their offices to amass wealth and power. And who pays the bill? Thank you, sir, may I please have another? And Illinois taxpayers flee across the borders the way peasants of old fled from the Mongols. One critic who doesn’t like the Pritzker “fair tax” is Ted Dabrowski, budget analyst from wirepoints.org . He believes that without structural reform, meaning cuts in government spending and changes in the pension deals, all we’re doing is wasting our money. Advertisement “It doesn’t matter what side of the aisle you’re on, the fact is Illinois has become the extreme outlier nationally,” Dabrowski said. “We have the largest pension debt burden. The worst population losses. The highest property tax rates. The worst political corruption. And we’re the least tax-friendly state in the nation, according to Kiplinger. More tax hikes will only make every one of those problems worse. “What Illinois politicians keep forgetting is that all Illinoisans need to do to leave behind Illinois’ high taxes and massive debts is to move right over the border. It’s already happening. Illinois has shrunk more than any other state in the nation since 2010.” Still, I’m sure that many who yearn to trust Pritzker and Madigan will be angry with me and insist that the middle class will never be bled dry by Pritzker’s “fair tax.” So, here’s a test to prove how much you trust them. Just put $1,000 cash in an envelope and mail it to Springfield with a note inside, asking that your money be returned to you safely. Address it to: Department of We Trust Springfield, Don’t You?

815,"The Cook County justice system’s two top lawyers said Tuesday they hope the response to the COVID-19 outbreak at Cook County Jail will ultimately spur far-reaching bail reform..  “I think we have seen that we can release people safely to the community,” said Cook County Public Defender Amy Campanelli, who has been working with State’s Attorney Kim Foxx and Sheriff Tom Dart to reduce the jail population in response to the outbreak. “Just because someone is charged with an offense does not mean that they are going to reoffend or not return to court.”.  Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors Foxx said that she was “very hopeful” that efforts to reduce the jail population will continue and that what had been done so far was “a demonstration to the public who are now paying attention to these issues that bail reform was long overdue.”.  Six detainees and one correctional officer at the jail have died from COVID-19 since the pandemic began..  Although recent efforts have seen the jail population shrink to a little over 4,100 detainees from more than 5,600 in mid-March, those who remain locked up are fearful, Campanelli says..  “My clients are very scared. They are nervous about getting sick. They are nervous about ending up in the hospital and possibly dying,” said Campanelli. “I’ve heard recently that my clients do have masks but that’s fairly recent. They did not have gloves or masks as of probably two weeks ago.”.  On Monday, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that mandates additional testing and social distancing measures as well as greater efforts to clean and sanitize the jail..  U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly, who earlier this month rejected a petition from Campanelli calling for the mass release of detainees, gave the sheriff’s office until Friday to provide face masks to all detainees in quarantine and implement new plans eliminating “bullpens” to house new inmates being processed into the jail..  “When I filed that petition on March 23 I did ask for a mass release,” said Campanelli. “I do feel that we can release certain categories of people.”.  She said that the widespread policy of mass incarceration in the U.S. simply hasn’t worked..  “Bail reform right now is working and we have to continue on that path of returning citizens to their homes,” said Campanelli, who estimates her office has won the release of more than 1,700 detainees since late March, including 230 who got bail through the National Bail Project. “Many of my clients deserve to go home and they can go home safely. And we’ve proven through our bail reform efforts the percentages of people who reoffend in a violent manner who are returned to the community is less than two percent. You do not lock up 98% of folks because 2% may reoffend. We did that for 50 years. It didn’t work.”.  While Foxx is supportive of the overall aim of bail reform, she said her office cannot support the mass release of detainees..  “We have to make sure that we are ensuring both public health and public safety, and so for us it is a matter of looking at each case individually to make sure that we are not releasing someone back in to the community that may pose a public safety risk,” said Foxx. “Not being able to look at each case individually denies us the opportunity to do that.”.  Foxx noted that she and Campanelli and other stakeholders had been working together to reduce the jail population for several years..  “But I think we want to be mindful that even as we are talking about bail reform we are doing this in a way (in which) decarceration efforts are balancing safety and public health,” Foxx said.","[0.5010887384414673, 0.4989112913608551]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5010887384414673
816,".  Not so certain how significant based upon Boone’s numbers being substantially below state’s per capita numbers. Coronavirus cases have grown fastest in these counties in each state across the US Evan Comen and Thomas C. Frohlich.  24/7 Wall Street.  More than 1 million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in the U.S. as of Tuesday April 28, by far the most of any country..  Within the United States, every state is facing its own outbreak. New York has by far the most cases and the highest incidence of the disease. Within the state, New York City has by far the most infections, but the rise of new cases in the city has started to slow, according to recent data..  The vast majority of counties that had confirmed COVID-19 cases seven days ago have far more today. In every state, there is one county where cases have grown the fastest in the past week..  The speed of the virus as it spreads to communities across the United States is likely to be closely related to how well residents practice social distancing . In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Mark Seidner, associate professor of infectious diseases at Harvard University and clinician at Massachusetts General Hospital, explained that with no vaccine and no effective treatment options, ""social distancing is the only intervention we have currently to stop the epidemic."".  COVID-19 testing: CVS, Walgreens ramp up free coronavirus testing outside of stores.  Coronavirus effects: 100,000 retail stores could close by 2025, accelerated by COVID-19, analysts say.  Studies have shown statewide social distancing measures to be associated with a decrease in U.S. COVID-19 growth . Many of the hotspots that have emerged, and a significant number of states where cases are growing the fastest, are places that have not implemented social distancing policies. Other recent studies have shown population mobility to be negatively correlated with the spread of COVID-19 on the county level. These are the states where the virus is spreading the fastest right now..  According to Seidner, social distancing measures and testing heavily depend on one another. ""Social distancing relies on testing to be effective because if you don't know the rate at which the epidemic is growing or hopefully slowing, [then] you don't know when to relax it [and] you don't know when to institute it."".  Testing data for counties is not published widely enough to include in this list, but it is likely that counties reporting more COVID-19 cases are also testing more of their populations. Testing statistics published by state health departments shows that the states testing larger shares of their populations are reporting higher confirmed cases per resident. All five of the states with the most COVID-19 cases per capita have testing rates considerably higher than the nationwide average of 989 tests per 100,000 people. These are the states with the highest number of COVID cases..  To identify the county in every state where COVID-19 cases are growing the fastest, 24/7 Wall St. compiled and reviewed confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths for the seven days through April 22 from state and local health departments. Counties were ranked on the percentage change in total cases from April 15 to total cases on April 22. Only counties with at least 10 cases as of April 15, 2020 were considered..  Methodology.  We calculated the percentage of workers employed in high-risk industries using 2018 annual employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.

817,"Illinois is one of 10 states that pays more in federal taxes than it receives in federal funding. A high response rate to the 2020 census can change that..  As the novel coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on the U.S. economy and tax revenue across the country and in Illinois, Pritzker stressed the importance of the census as it pertains to aid. Apportionment of federal funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act is partially based on 2010 census counts..  Stratton also emphasized the need for Latino Illinoisans to participate in the census and addressed fears of retaliation..  “Our census doesn’t hurt, it helps. The census questionnaire will not ask your citizenship status,” she said. “Your personal information will not be used against you in court or by any government agency like ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement). For far too long some members of our Latino community have been told to keep their doors closed and not be seen, but no more. You have the power, and you deserve to be seen and counted,” she said..  The Trump administration attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but those efforts were blocked by multiple federal courts last year. It does not appear on the final form, and any respondent information is kept confidential by law..  As of Wednesday, Illinois was number 7 in terms of self-response, with a 69.8% rate. Illinois ranks 12th in total “enumeration,” or the percentage of households in the state that have been counted in the census, at 89.8 percent. Among states with a population over 10 million, Illinois ranks first in both categories. Bears coach Matt Nagy Expects Decision Soon on Starting QB.  In 2010, which only allowed self-response via mail, Illinois had a 70.5% response rate. The 2020 census allows for residents to self-file a form online, through mail or by phone..  The state is on track to meet its 2010 response rate, but structural obstacles to filling out the census have kept response rates low in some parts of the state, including some rural counties and several census tracts on the south and west sides of Chicago among others..  Lack of access to broadband internet, the prevalence of PO boxes which the Census Bureau does not send forms to, and the difficulty census door-knockers have reaching rural residents all factor into some county’s having response rates as low as 33.4 percent..  The state has just 27 days to increase its response rates after the Trump administration shortened the deadline for reporting from the end of October to the end of September..  A federal lawsuit to restore the original deadline is ongoing..  Illinoisans can fill out the census by mail, online at 2020census.gov , or by calling (844) 330-2020.

818,"By Esther Yoon-Ji Kang Friday, Sept. 4, 6 a.m. CT.  With less than a month before the U.S. Census Bureau stops counting, a new report shows the Chicago area is at risk of a census undercount, especially among communities of color..  Thus far in this year’s count, some Chicago-area communities are showing self-response rates that are more than 20 percentage points below those from the 2010 census, according to a recent report from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP)..  Erin Aleman, the agency’s executive director, said the trend is disheartening..  “Just because we count less people or get less money, that doesn’t mean we have less people or services to distribute across the region,” she said. “Whether it’s housing or whether it’s infrastructure, those are things that still have to happen for everyone in a community regardless or not if they were counted.”.  According to the report , Hispanic communities, both in Chicago and the suburbs, have the biggest drops in participation since 2010. Black and Asian communities are also showing lower response rates. In contrast, communities with predominantly white residents are matching their self-response rates from 2010..  The census count determines political representation and federal funding. Aleman said one recent example of how an undercount could hurt the state is the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill Congress passed in response to the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic..  If the state’s population had been just 5% less, Aleman said, Illinois would have missed out on $235.5 million in COVID-19 relief funds. “That’s money that goes directly to communities to help deal with crisis,” she said..  Aleman added that fears among immigrants, the pandemic and the lack of tech accessibility with the census going online have all affected residents’ participation..  Chicago’s census self-response rate is at around 58%, compared to almost 70% nationwide. In some parts of the city’s South and West sides — including areas in the Little Village, Englewood and South Chicago neighborhoods — those numbers are closer to 30%..  In the remaining weeks before the U.S. Census Bureau concludes enumeration, community organizations are scrambling to encourage residents to fill out the census..  Ignacio Medina, who leads census outreach efforts for Erie Neighborhood House, says his group is focused on boosting the numbers in Little Village, as well as nearby west suburban Cicero and Berwyn..  Medina said even after months of outreach, many undocumented immigrants in Latino communities are afraid to fill out the census. “They think [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] is going to show up at their door,” Medina said. Some, he added, are still asking, “This is only for citizens, right?”.  Medina also said residents he’s reaching out to have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. “The last thing on their mind is the census,” he said. “They are thinking, ‘How am I going to recover? How am I going to pay my bills? How am I going to provide for my family?”.  Medina’s group is setting up tables in front of local businesses and inside government buildings to provide information about the census and to also help residents fill out the questionnaire..  On Thursday, at a press conference in Berwyn, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker urged residents to fill out the census and to encourage friends and neighbors to do the same..  “We have only 27 days left to get counted,” Pritzker said, adding that “the stakes could not be higher.”.

819,"Illinois’ wealthiest man and frequent Republican political donor Ken Griffin has pledged $20 million to a group dedicated to defeating a graduated tax constitutional amendment..  Griffin, who is the founder of the hedge fund Citadel, has previously donated tens of millions of dollars to the campaign of Republican former Gov. Bruce Rauner. He’s also given millions to House and Senate Republican leadership in the state and donated to several individual lawmakers. Forbes estimates his net worth at $15 billion. Illinois special investigative committee to begin Madigan hearings next week.  His recent $20 million donation went to the Coalition to Stop the Proposed Tax Hike Amendment ballot initiative committee. Prior to Griffin’s donation, the committee had received $950,000 in donations..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker has already dropped more than $50 million of his own personal fortune, estimated at $3.4 billion, in support of his marquee legislative proposal. His donation went to the Vote Yes for Fairness ballot initiative committee..  The constitutional amendment in question would scrap the state’s protection of a flat-rate income tax for a new structure allowing lawmakers to tax different levels of income at fluctuating tax rates. A progressive rate structure that would take effect if the amendment passes is expected to bring in more than $1 billion in additional state revenue this fiscal year and more than $3 billion annually when it is implemented for a full fiscal year..  It will be up to the voters in November as to whether the state gains authority to scrap the flat tax, which is currently 4.95 percent for every penny of taxable income for every taxpayer. If more than half of those voting in the November election, or three-fifths of those voting on the ballot question, approve the measure, a graduated rate structure can take effect..  Lawmakers have already approved the rate structure that will become law should the measure pass..  Effective Jan. 1, rates would remain flat or decrease for those earning $250,000 or less, while they would increase for those earning above that amount..  Individuals earning more than $750,000 and joint filers with incomes exceeding $1 million would see the largest tax increases. A flat tax rate of 7.99 percent on all income would apply to anyone exceeding those thresholds..  For all other earners, each varying tax rate would apply to only one specific margin of income..  The rates are 4.75 percent on taxable income from $0 to $10,000; 4.9 percent from $10,001 to $100,000; 4.95 percent from $100,001 to $250,000..  For joint filers, a 7.75 percent rate would kick in on margins from $250,001 to $500,000; and 7.85 percent from $500,001 to $1 million. For single filers, the 7.75 percent rate applies from $250,001 to $350,000, while the 7.85 percent rate applies from $350,001 to $750,000. Cleared data backlog leads to spike in Friday’s Illinois COVID-19 tests, cases.  The measure also includes an increase in the property tax credit from 5 percent to 6 percent, and up to a $100 per-child tax credit for couples earning less than $100,000 and single persons earning less than $80,000..  The corporate tax rate would go from 7 to 7.99 percent, not including an existing corporate property replacement tax of 1.5 to 2.5 percent that is not changed by the bill..  Opponents of the graduated tax have not disputed the rates that will become law upon its passage, but they argue that the change does not put safeguards in place to prevent future adjustments to the rate structure that could impose higher taxes on lower levels of income..  The necessary threshold to raise taxes in the General Assembly would remain unchanged by the amendment, although opponents argue it would make the task politically easier by allowing lawmakers to raise taxes on different tax brackets at different times..  In light of receiving the big check from Griffin, the Coalition said in a statement it “welcomes support from anyone who believes we must stop Springfield politicians from having new power to increase income taxes on every group of taxpayers, whenever they want.”.  “The constitutional amendment sets no limit on the number of tax brackets that can be created and no limit on how high tax rates can be increased on groups of individual taxpayers – including middle-income families,” the statement added..  Earlier in the week, more than 125 labor unions organized by the Vote Yes for Fair Tax ballot initiative committee hosted a virtual news conference to announce their support for the measure. Officials urge residents to fill out census as deadline approaches.  “Yesterday — the day that unions representing more than 1 million Illinois workers stood up to support Fair Tax reform—the state's richest billionaire Ken Griffin spent $20 million to protect the broken status quo,” John Bouman, the chairman of the group, said in a news release. “Griffin took home $1.5 billion in 2019 alone, yet paid the same state income tax rate as teachers, nurses, grocery store clerks and other essential workers. That’s wrong and it's exactly why Illinois needs the Fair Tax amendment.”.  In August, the Illinois State Black Chamber of Commerce and the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce announced opposition to the graduated tax as well, warning of the effects a tax hike could have on job creators..  Proponents, however, point out that small businesses owners operating as sole proprietors or pass-through entities such as S-corporations will see a tax reduction under the plan if they have less than $250,000 in annual income..

820,"Save.  NORMAL — Illinois State University upped its graduate student enrollment by 4% this fall, holding steady overall with a total enrollment of 20,720 students ..  “Illinois State’s strong fall enrollment figures attest to the university’s commitment to providing an excellent educational experience and individualized attention, even during the most challenging circumstances,” said President Larry Dietz in a statement..  Total enrollment declined by less than 1% compared to last year’s 20,878, officials said. ISU’s total student population now includes 17,987 undergraduates and 2,733 graduate students..  The university’s official 10th day of classes census recorded 3,353 freshmen this fall. That's compared to 3,860 last year , when ISU had reported its largest freshman class in three decades. New transfers also added 1,678 students to the enrollment numbers, a decline of less than 1% from last academic year..  Early in August, the university moved most of its classes — with exceptions for those that required in-person components, like art and science labs — to remote learning because of concerns about coronavirus and the availability of testing materials. ISU reported Friday that it has had 1,283 cases of COVID-19 confirmed through on-campus testing since classes began Aug. 17..  The rolling seven-day positivity rate, which is based on the number of positive results out of total tests performed, was 20%..  “We are pleased to have a very talented group of new freshmen, transfers and graduate students this year, as well as a significant number of students who are returning for their sophomore, junior and senior years,” said Jana Albrecht, associate vice president of enrollment management. “We have our second largest honors class (with 400 new additions from the freshmen class), and our retention rates are significantly higher compared to the last five years.”.  Dietz said beginning this school year in “a world changed by COVID-19” has affected the way ISU handles recruitment efforts..  “Illinois State takes a team approach to planning for and adapting to the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. That same team approach applies to recruiting talented students and helping them transition to their lives at Illinois State,” Dietz said, thanking those who work in these areas year round..  University officials last week announced plans to develop a $1 million on-campus COVID-19 testing lab and allow more flexibility for canceling on-campus housing and meal contracts..  The incoming freshman class has a high school GPA of 3.5 on a 4.0 scale, an average ACT score near 24 and an average SAT score of 1125, ISU said..  International enrollment took a slight dip with 547 students, compared to 558 last year.

ILLINOIS, USA — The Illinois State Board of Education is offering free, healthy meals and snacks to children and teens 18 or younger this summer..  With the COVID-19 pandemic affecting so many families, the ISBE said it expects more need for the program than ever, but it is ready to help..  “COVID-19 has turned many families’ lives upside down,"" said State Superintendent of Education Dr. Carmen Ayala. ""Illinois’ summer meals programs help to ensure that one thing families do not have to worry about is where their children will get their next meal.”.  ISBE received clearance from the USDA to serve the meals in safe, social-distancing compliant ways like curbside pickup and home delivery. Families will also be able to pick up multiple days of meals at once..  For more information about eligibility and the nearest summer meals site by calling (800) 359-2163, texting 'FoodIL' to 877-877 or going to the program's website, summermealsillinois.org ..  If your organization would like to sign up to be a summer meals site, you can find more information on the ISBE website ..  Here are some frequently asked questions about the program and answers from ISBE. What is the Summer Food Service Program?.  The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) was instituted to provide nutritious meals to children during the summer months when school is not in session. The program is funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and administered by the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE)..  Sponsoring organizations include: Public or private non-profit local education agencies; Entities of state, local, municipal or county government; Residential camps; and Private non-profit organizations with 501(c)(3) status. Who qualifies for participation in the program?.  The SFSP is directed towards children in areas of high need. As part of the application process, sponsors must document 50% eligibility of the area or individual participants they intend to serve. Eligibility can be determined through: Free and reduced-price school lunch statistics, State or local government studies plotting low-income areas, Updated census tract data, or Individual documentation..  If the service meets the eligibility criteria, all meals served to children are eligible for reimbursement. Residential camps are an exception since they can only claim meals served to children that qualify through individual documentation. The SFSP defines a child as anyone 18 years of age or younger or any person 21 years of age or younger with a mental or physical disability that attends an ISBE certified school program during the school year. How are sponsors reimbursed for meals?.  Reimbursements are based on the number of reimbursable meals served multiplied by the sum of the administrative and operational rates.

But now that both the spread of COVID-19 and rampant gun violence in Chicago is pretty much solved, she’s tackling what’s really important–the 2020 Census..  Oh, wait. Those other things aren’t solved. She’s just shifting focus onto something that isn’t deadly–and helps determine federal funding for the city..  Trending: Dear Leftists: Old Video Of Joe Biden Surfaces Where He Says The N-Word Twice–Is He ‘Canceled’?.  Mayor Lightfoot had set an ambitious goal of 75% response rate for the Census, but with the pandemic and the rise in the already high crime in some areas of Chicago following the George Floyd protests that have morphed into riots, the response rate is sitting at about 55%..  Seizing on the newfound celebrity status of Adam Hollingsworth, the “Dread Head Cowboy,” who became a local icon for riding his horse in the Loop during the George Floyd protests, Mayor Lightfoot is pushing for Census compliance..  During a very weird presser, Mayor Lightfoot donned a lime green cowboy hat and made a bizarre reference to Batman..  But it was the ‘Dread Head Cowboy” and not the Dark Knight that answered the mayor’s call. In rode Adam Hollingsworth on horseback to the tune of “Old Town Road,” by Lil Nas X. The 33-year-old former boxer is expected to spend the next week riding through 10 South and West Side wards where response is lowest, with the goal of boosting census participation… …Riding to the rescue of the U.S. census in neighborhoods with low response rates — including East and West Garfield Park, Washington Park, Woodlawn, Englewood, Greater Grand Crossing, North and South Lawndale, Back of the Yards and West Englewood — is an equally noble goal. It’ll help determine whether long-neglected South and West Side neighborhoods further ravaged by looting and mayhem that started May 30 and continued into early June get federal funding they so desperately need for schools, parks, roads, bridges, mass transit and job training..  Source: Chicago Sun-Times.  Watch: Giddy up, Chicago. I'm calling on the Census Cowboy to help improve our Census response rates across Chicago. Make the Census Cowboy proud by filling out the Census today at https://t.co/tt2S9ojTmW . pic.twitter.com/eT2e6V74uk.  — Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) July 13, 2020.  I’m sure that the areas in question aren’t in the “Deadliest ‘Hoods” listing on HeyJackass.com , are they?.  Oh, look at that. They are..  Here is a map of the shootings in Chicago updated on July 13, 2020..  Hmmm…seems like residents in Englewood, Humbolt Park, Garfield Park, Austin, North Lawndale, and a few other areas have bigger concerns than compliance with the 2020 Census..  Chicagoans were not amused by the Mayor’s newfound focus on the Census..  Yours truly noted that it’s also quite infantilizing. What did I just watch?!?.  The problem with so many politicians is that they don’t treat voters as adults..  — K. Walker (@TheMrsKnowItAll) July 13, 2020.  This looks like Mayor Lightfoot’s version of Bill de Blasio’s BLM mural on Fifth Avenue..  Rather than focus on the high crime in her city, she’s zeroing in on the Census because it will mean more cash for the city. To do what exactly? Continue to ignore violent crime in certain neighborhoods?.  At least Mayor Lightfoot isn’t calling to defund the police like some other progressive mayors are doing. Still, Chicago has an atrocious murder solve rate –especially if the victim is black–and that has been the status quo for years. It’s time for some reform..  But I don’t think that’s a job for the “Census Cowboy” or the “Dread Head Cowboy” or anyone but the Mayor and the city’s law enforcement leaders. K.

834,"Subscribe to Crime Trends Photo by DanGutierrez via Flickr.  Trends in crime rates for 2019 offer some good news, including decreases that offset a spike in 2015 and 2016 in many places, says the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University ..  Crime in Chicago is down. Though it hasn’t returned to 2014 levels, compared to late November of last year, reported crimes are down by 10 percent. That decrease is driven partly by significant declines in property crime. Violent crime has fallen by 11 percent..  Robberies and aggravated assaults are down by 18 percent and 5 percent, respectively. Homicides, which increased sharply between 2015 and 2016 — are down again by about 13 percent, dropping to 452 killings compared to 517 at the same time last year..  Chicago is on track to record fewer than 500 homicides this year, a 35 percent decrease from 2016..  Even if Chicago returned to its 2014 murder rate, that would still be three times higher than the national rate..  In New York City, the number of crimes reported through December 1 is largely unchanged from the prior year. While homicides are up around 8 percent, New York City’s was 30 percent below the national murder rate last year..  In San Francisco, data through October shows significant declines in the number of homicides (down around 18 percent) and reported rapes (down 14 percent) contributing to a 7 percent decrease in violent crimes reported. Property crimes are down 5 percent overall, with the number of reported burglaries falling 16 percent..  These are small declines, considering San Francisco’s high rate of property crime, the third highest last year among cities with populations of 500,000 or more..  It followed only Memphis and Albuquerque, two cities that struggle with poverty and associated crimes..  In Philadelphia, reform-oriented district attorney Larry Krasner eliminated cash bail for most nonviolent offenses, required prosecutors to explain the cost of incarceration when seeking a prison sentence, directed them to seek lighter sentences generally, and dropped some drug cases..  Homicides in Philadelphia increased more than 10 percent in 2018, prompting some concern about the consequences of his reforms. This year, through December 1, violence appears to be stabilizing, with violent crime rising by just 4 percent..  That includes a less than 1 percent rise in the number of homicides; upticks in robbery and aggravated assault account for most of the increase..  The relative stability in violent crime has occurred even as the jail population dropped. In January 2017, the average daily population was 6,807. Two years later, it was down to 4,699..  President Donald Trump argues that the border and border cities are extremely dangerous places and that cities like El Paso, Tx., are kept safe only by draconian immigration policies, physical walls, or both..  Yet El Paso remains one of the nation’s safest cities. In 2018, of the 50 largest cities, El Paso reported the fourth lowest violent crime rate and second lowest crime rate, trailing only Virginia Beach, Va. Through August of this year, the number of crimes and violent crimes is down a little over 3 percent..  Even with the 22 people killed in August in a massacre perpetrated by a white supremacist, El Paso is on track for a very low number of homicides for a city its size. But it’s telling, and tragic, that one person carrying a single assault rifle can double a major city’s murder count in a hate-filled attack..  Baltimore was place where crime and violence spiked in 2015: Baltimore. This year, Baltimore’s story continues to be a mixed one. The total number of crimes reported in the city through November fell by almost 6 percent compared to 2018, with violent crime falling by about 2.5 percent..  Robbery, burglary, theft, and auto theft decreased modestly, while reported rape fell dramatically — with law enforcement documenting nearly 26 percent fewer offenses..  The murder total rose. Through November, there were 313 homicides reported — an increase of 31 from the same time in 2018. This increase could offset the progress the city made last year, when the city’s homicide total dropped by roughly 10 percent, from 342 to 309..  Among 24 similarly sized cities, just two saw higher violent crimes rates than Baltimore in 2018: Detroit and Memphis..  The Brennan Center says it is too soon to draw national conclusions, but the declines in Chicago point in a positive direction..  The center says that 2019 data so far point to “significant public safety gains in some major cities and stabilization in others. The few trouble spots also indicate the need for targeted, smart solutions to urban violence.” TCR's WEEKLY Criminal Justice Newsletter is FREE! Subscribe Here About Ted Gest.

837,"To compete with record low unemployment, the U.S. Census is offering higher wages than it has ever offered..  With Illinois’ unemployment rate at 3.7 percent in December, Ellisa Johnson deputy regional director for the Chicago Regional Census Bureau, said the bureau needs thousands of additional temporary workers. “In Illinois, our goal was 80,000,” she said. “At last count, the state was a little above 90 percent of our recruiting goal.” According to its website, the Census is now offering jobs paying up to $29.50 per hour in the Chicago area, $23.50 an hour in the Peoria area, and $21 an hour in Springfield. Hourly pay in each county is at least $17 per hour with reimbursements. Johnson said these workers are necessary to ensure all Illinoisans are counted this spring. “Once every ten years, we have a responsibility to our communities to make sure that we are responding,” she said. It’s important, Johnson said, to hire people from the local area because they not only know their way around better, but are also better received when knocking on doors. “We are hypersensitive about hiring from within our communities,” she said. “It just pays off when you have individuals from communities where they live and where they reside.” This is the first Census that allows people to enter information online or by phone.","[0.6930215358734131, 0.3069784641265869]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.6930215358734131

839,"Hardis White, 78, could hardly wait to break out of suburbia..  He dressed in a flannel shirt, jeans and a Bears cap, strode out of the rectangular bungalow he shares with his wife and daughter and folded his tall frame behind the wheel of his silver Nissan sedan..  Advertisement Forty minutes away from his suburban neighborhood of Hillside, he arrived in Chicago, on Laporte Avenue, to see what he had come to see: a handsome brick house with white trim, two stories tall, as solid as the first day he saw it in 1967..  For a moment, he gazed at the house. Marvin Gaye played softly on the radio. The grass seemed a little long, he murmured. He put the car back in gear and started back to the suburbs..  “I don’t know why I keep coming back,” he said. “I guess I just miss the neighborhood.”.  Some people, lured by nostalgia and curiosity, drive past their old houses now and then. Hardis does it nearly every day..  Today, he is one of the more than 200,000 African Americans who have moved out of Chicago in the past two decades, though in some ways, he never left. For more than a year, he has taken this daily pilgrimage back to the house on Laporte, to the city where his children grew up and where two of his daughters still live..  The steady exodus of African Americans has caused alarm and grief in Chicago, the nation’s third largest city, where black people have shaped the history, culture and political life. The population of 2.7 million is still nearly split in thirds among whites, blacks and Latinos, but the balance is shifting. Chicago saw its population decline in 2018, the fourth year in a row. Since 2015, almost 50,000 black residents have left.","[0.7099849581718445, 0.2900150418281555]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.7099849581718445

What do a bunch of Swiss bankers know that nearly 1 million people who have moved out of Chicago since 1950 don't?.  Maybe it's an appreciation of cities on lakes. The UBS headquarters is a 10-minute walk from Lake Zurich. But the bank's annual Global Real Estate Bubble Index, followed by lenders, multinational companies and investors, has for years shown housing prices in some global cities soaring beyond apparent reason. Prices in Munich, Toronto, Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Vancouver and Paris were well into bubble risk when the most recent list was assembled, and most others on the list were considered overvalued..  Chicago homes, remarkably, cost the same as they did 20 years ago on an inflation-adjusted basis. And yet the city checks the other boxes to qualify for inclusion on a global-cities list: top universities, world class museums, an innovative and eclectic restaurant scene, commanding architecture and an extensive public transit system. It's the business and cultural hub of the American Midwest, though often overlooked by the Coastal Elite..  UBS calculates that a skilled service worker must work three years to pay for a 650-square-foot apartment near the city center in Chicago. In New York, it takes 11 years; in Paris, 15 years; in Hong Kong, 21 years..  What is peculiar to Chicago that accounts for its housing being so cheap? Population loss -- though not as severe as seen in Detroit or St. Louis -- is a big factor. Going from 3.6 million city residents in 1950 to 2.7 million today lessened demand for existing and new housing. Economic growth lags that of major coastal cities.

A long history of local and state political corruption has prevented solutions to that and other problems. And crime hasn't shown the enormous decreases enjoyed by New York and Los Angeles in recent years..  There are also problems Chicago shares with other big cities. Among them, its school system does a great job educating elite students, but the rank-and-file schools often fail those who attend.

So, like many other big cities, Chicago is often a great place to live for those who can afford to enjoy its many attractions and navigate its patchy education and public safety realms, and a very different and difficult city for others.

Chicago offers close-in neighborhood living, in both single-family homes and apartments and condos, at a fraction of the cost one would pay in major coastal cities. In Bucktown and Wicker Park, just four stops out from the Loop on the L's Blue Line, the median home price is below just $500,000. The area is home to a lively restaurant and bar scene. Its housing stock is a mix of 100-year-old three-flats, typically rehabbed multiple times; modest single-family homes of a similar vintage; some larger apartment and condo developments; and, during the past 30 years, teardowns that are often very large, some across multiple lots. The area is fabulously walkable and home to the elevated 606 walkway..   The South Loop has been transformed from warehouse, light manufacturing and patches of housing into a forest of high-rise and mid-rise condo and apartment structures.

844,"June 4, 2020 8:57 Health Illinois Latino COVID-19 Initiative Urges Stronger Health Response Illinois Latino COVID-19 Initiative Urges Stronger Health Response Health | Comments Off on Illinois Latino COVID-19 Initiative Urges Stronger Health Response.  As Illinois prepares to move into Phase 3 of its reopening plan, too many health and economic disparities remain unaddressed for the state’s communities of color. The Illinois Latino COVID-19 Initiative calls on government, philanthropy, and all other institutions of power to more proactively protect these communities and their state. Although Illinois as a whole has flattened the curve of COVID-19, the Latino community continues to have alarmingly high infection rates and case-positivity rates. These disparities in positivity rates are not simply due to an increase in COVID-19 testing. As of Tuesday, May 26, about 1.6 percent of all Latinos (possibly higher due to 52 percent of missing data statewide) in Illinois have been infected with COVID-19, which is a dramatically higher rate than those of the state overall (0.9 percent) and of its white non-Hispanic population (0.3 percent). Latinos comprise about 17 percent of the state’s population, but about 30 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the state (higher when including undercount). While Chicago continues to see alarming rates, outside of Chicago, Latino cases are also disproportionality high. The Initiative has identified the following urgent steps and calls on all Illinois leaders to take action..  1. Collect accurate, complete surveillance data by race and ethnicity. Latinos are not being properly categorized with respect to COVID-19 testing, morbidity, and mortality. We need to reduce the missing demographic data and consistently obtain the ethnic breakdown of Latino and other racial and ethnic groups by national origin, census tracts, community type (urban or rural), age and gender, etc. We call on the Governor to issue an executive order assuring that all sectors responsible for data collection record accurate demographic data including race, ethnicity, sex, and gender and to mandate training, as needed, to accurately and rigorously maintain testing, morbidity, and mortality records..  2. Increase the number of testing sites and assure that all testing sites have robust capacity and infrastructure including the necessary staffing, supplies, and funding for testing, counseling, and follow-up in areas with a high concentration of Latinos..  3. Testing sites should not deter non-citizens by imposing barriers within communities where people who are uninsured or undocumented live. Testing sites should refrain from asking about citizenship status, should expand opportunities for testing without an appointment or without a healthcare provider’s referral, and should ensure that residents are aware of State programs that address the cost of testing and treatment for COVID-19. Testing sites should also triage people presenting for testing and refer for immediate medical attention where appropriate..  4. All levels of government should have a plan to provide adequate case-finding, contact-tracing, and follow-up with culturally and linguistically appropriate approaches. This plan should be done in part by leveraging the resources of community-based organizations..  5. Provide Latinos who test positive with a COVID-19 home care kit of items to monitor disease severity. This may include a thermometer, pulse oximeter, bilingual English and Spanish educational materials about how to protect themselves and other family members, and strict precautions for when to seek immediate emergency care and when it is okay to stay home..  6. Provide temporary housing to Latino essential workers who have tested positive and cannot maintain social distancing at home. This information should also be on the access helpline in Spanish..  7. Engage in a comprehensive English and Spanish health education campaign that will use ethnic and mainstream media, including social media platforms, and utilize professional bilingual and bicultural personnel to translate and regularly update COVID-19 educational messages and materials..  8. Develop administrative policies to protect vulnerable populations including people with disabilities, nursing home residents, immigrants, and undocumented workers, among others. Ensure that federal, state, county, and city COVID-19 services are available to them, including protections and inclusion of these groups in federal stimulus relief efforts..  9. Enforce occupational, safety, and health guidelines in small businesses in Latino communities, meatpacking industries, and other industries with high concentrations of people of color..  10. Release and distribute COVID-19 financial resources across various communities equitably and transparently.","[0.503479540348053, 0.4965204894542694]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.503479540348053

Ten years later it became the daily Hoy. It was one of six daily Spanish-language newspapers in the United States, where an estimated 41 million US residents, or 13.4% of the population, speak Spanish at home. An estimated 22.5 million also are bilingual, according to the US Census. The last issue of Hoy is available on newsstands in Chicago. (Photo by Elio Leturia).  Tilden Katz, a spokesperson for Tribune, said in a statement that, “Tribune Publishing will be expanding Spanish-language content through the syndicated Tribune Content Agency and aggressively exploring other options to meet the changing readership needs of our important Hispanic communities.” When asked if the company could answer any questions beyond the original statement, Katz declined to comment..  The six Hoy employees will be offered employment somewhere else within the company, according to the Tribune statement. Rodríguez, who worked as a multimedia journalist for Hoy for nearly five years, said the exact positions and pay grade have not yet been determined..  She said it’s also unclear exactly how the Tribune will engage with its Spanish-speaker readers. “All we know is what they said in their press releases, that they are going to find a way to reach the Spanish-speaking community. But no, we are not aware of any plan. Or at least not that I know of,” Rodriguez said...  Fernando Díaz, who was Hoy’s managing editor for almost five years, was surprised by the announcement but knew that the day would come. “I—and many of us who work in Latinx media—knew they would one day close Hoy,” said Díaz, now editor and publisher of the Chicago Reporter. “That’s part of the reason I left in 2014.” He also expressed his pride in Hoy’s run, saying, “The ending of Hoy is bittersweet. I know there is a lot of disappointment aimed at Tribune for closing it, but we have to recognize that they maintained that paper for 10 years. Its presence in many ways showed that the Hispanic community was large and regional.”.  Clemente Nicado, publisher of NegociosNow, a Chicago-based business publication, recalled his first impressions when he started working as a business reporter at Hoy a month before it launched in 2003. “After 10 years as an international correspondent for publications in Latin America, I felt that I had a unique opportunity to cover the Hispanic community under the umbrella of a mainstream outlet. I believe that everyone who started that trip was permeated with the idea that we were making history in Chicago’s Latino press and working to honor that idea.”.  With the closing of Hoy, an entire community lost its news source, said Hugo Balta, president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. He called it “detrimental.”.  “The United States is the second most populous country when it comes to Spanish-speaking people, second only to Mexico, Balta said. “This is a bilingual country. So in a market like Chicago, where we are seeing a continued growth in the Hispanic Latino community including foreign-born Spanish dominant Hispanics to have an outlet like Hoy shut down, one of very few, is detrimental in assisting a community that, like so many immigrant communities, not just Latinos, gravitate to media in order to learn how to navigate in their adoptive country as well as stay in touch with their family and their friends back home.”.  Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Washington, D.C. still have daily Spanish-language newspapers. La Opinión in Los Angeles, founded in 1926, is the largest. The Chicago region has several non-daily Spanish-language publications, including La Raza. Telemundo and Univision also broadcast in Spanish. Red Latina, a bilingual digital publication, provides Spanish-language news in the St. Louis area..  Carolina Cruz, a news producer for Telemundo Chicago, said the loss of the Spanish-language daily particularly affects the older generation..  “If you’re somebody that’s in their sixties or fifties, and you were just raised in a Hispanic household, speaking Spanish, and you move to a new place, and you’re trying to find out what’s going on and how it’s affecting your grandchild or your daughter… you’re going to look for that information in Spanish because that’s the language you feel more comfortable with. The loss of a publication like Hoy targeted mostly that audience, [and it] still exists,” she said..  Nicado said that the Hispanic community is bigger than it was in 2003. “They love to speak Spanish or speak both languages. You have to reach this community one way or another, whether through print, digital or television, or through a combination of them.” He says that Hoy’s spot will be occupied by another publication in Spanish or bilingual, but with a different business model. “Reaching them in the most effective and profitable way is the great challenge that publishers face.” Filed Under: Midwest , News and Opinion Archive ","[0.5010571479797363, 0.4989428222179413]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5010571479797363
850,"Reprints Print Getty Images.  Chicago bond shops helping hawk the city's big $1.2 billion offering stand to earn lucrative fees, but they'll have to work hard for the money..  It's the city's largest bond sale since 2017and perhaps the largest ever in terms of the $3.2 million in fees earmarked for minority-owned underwriters, including Chicago-based Loop Capital Markets and Cabrera Capital Markets..  The underwriters, led by New York giant Goldman Sachs, are racing to get Chicago the best price they can on the bonds in a sales process that was expected to wrap up as early as this month but is now likely to stretch into next year. It's no small matter for the cash-strapped city, which can use every penny to fund its new budget . Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the city's bankers are trying to persuade buyers to pay up for the new bonds despite the city's precarious finances and mixed bond agency reviews..  ""I really, really don't think that the delay has anything to do with the market not being there for Chicago,"" says John Miller, head of municipals in Chicago at big bond investment firm Nuveen. ""We can use Chicago bonds at today's market price,"" he says of the firm's interest, while declining to be explicit about how many bonds it may want and at what price..  Lightfoot's administration is pursuing the bond sale to refinance part of the city's outstanding $10.7 billion in general obligation and sales tax-backed bonds and lower its interest expense by $200 million. ""Instead of looking to one-time measures of the past, we are focused on prudent measures for addressing outstanding debt that will achieve significant near-term savings to the taxpayer without sacrificing the long-term financial health of the city,"" Chicago Chief Financial Officer Jennie Bennett said in an October statement..  The ""negotiated"" sale, as opposed to a competitive auction, means underwriters survey potential buyers before huddling to determine the right price. Just hours before the sale, the underwriters will post a price, but for now both sides are angling for the upper hand..  ""It's still competitive pricing because if we don't get a good price for the city, they're not going to use any of us,"" says Martin Cabrera, founder and CEO of Cabrera Capital Markets, a Hispanic-owned firm. He, too, refrained from discussing details..  Cabrera Capital is expected to be among the highest earners, landing $750,000 from the deal, like banks Goldman and JPMorgan Chase, as well as minority-owned firm Siebert Williams Shank, according to a document the city shared with City Council Finance Committee members. Loop Capital, led by CEO Jim Reynolds , and Chicago-based Melvin Securities, both African American-owned, each will earn $340,000, according to the document specifying fees for 12 firms..  Chicago has to balance the price it's asking for the bonds—including general obligation as well as sales tax revenue-based bonds sold through a separate entity—with the interest it's willing to pay as it gauges demand for the relatively large offering. And it's not the only seller in the market. Buyers are swamped this month with $38 billion in muni offerings, about 70 percent more than the same month last year, according to Nuveen, which is the biggest owner of Chicago bonds, with about $1.37 billion worth in its funds..  'THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE'.  For better or for worse, Chicago's bonds stand out from the pack. The city's financial condition is stressed, with rising costs, including for a new teachers contract; a revenue base hurt by its declining population; and seriously underfunded pension liabilities that make it the second worst-rated major city in the nation, after Detroit..  ""Pension challenges are the biggest challenge facing the city and the primary reason we have the city rated below investment grade,"" says Moody's Investors Service analyst David Levett..  Moody's was sidelined by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel after it downgraded Chicago to junk status in 2015. It still affirms that rating because of the nearly $5 billion in bonds it previously rated..  That rating is at odds with the opinion of New York's other major ratings agency, S&P Global Ratings. While the agencies share many of the same concerns about the city, S&P rates Chicago slightly better, enough to put it in investment grade territory..  The city's dicier outlook means a higher interest rate for buyers, and those high-yield opportunities have been harder to come by in the low interest rate environment..  Chicago's finances have improved over the past year, or at least they're not getting worse at the same rate. And the city's economy is still one of the largest in the country, with major companies relocating downtown in recent years and a booming tech corridor emerging on the West Side..  ""There are a lot of things there that continue to draw (in Chicago), so we don't see it, economically, as a city that's deteriorating,"" says S&P Global analyst Jane Ridley. Despite a tendency outside Chicago to lump the Windy City in with Detroit, Nuveen's Miller says Chicago isn't in danger of following suit on that Midwest city's bankruptcy filing in 2013..  The market has recognized the upswing, with Chicago's benchmark bond spread to the standard AAA-rated muni benchmark cut in half over the past few years (thanks partly to the overall market's advance), according to Nuveen..  Now, the underwriters just hope they can entice Nuveen and other investment firms to pay up for Chicago's new bonds. Letter to the Editor.  Have something to get off your chest?

In Chicago, 70 percent of the people who have died from coronavirus are Black, according to a WBEZ analysis . Black people comprise just 29 percent of Chicago’s population..  Statewide, about 30 percent of the people dying from coronavirus are Black, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said Sunday. Black people are about 14.6 percent of the state’s population, according to 2019 census estimates..  “We know all too well that there are general disparities in health outcomes that play along these racial lines and the same may be true for this virus,” Ezike said..  The state has worked to address health care disparities in Black and Brown communities, and resources will be directed where they are most desperately needed, Ezike said. The state will provide an updated breakdown of coronavirus deaths on Tuesday..  RELATED: 31 More Dead, 899 New Coronavirus Cases Confirmed In Illinois, Officials Say Sunday.  Gov. JB Pritzker said disparities existed in health care for people of color before the crisis — and coronavirus is emphasizing those differences..  For example, in Chicago, Downtown residents live on average 16 years longer than residents of Garfield Park , whose population has a higher portion of people of color..  “We already started out with an unequal system of health care for people. It gets massively exacerbated when you bring on something like COVID-19. I’m deeply concerned about this,” Pritkzer said..  The state wants to reopen suburban hospitals like MetroSouth and West Lake to deal with the crisis, and those will be in communities with more people of color, Pritzker noted..  And while officials are trying to address the health care gap, it has years-old roots that make it hard to overcome, Pritzker said..  “But it is a much broader problem that over the course of the three or four or five weeks … that it’s hard to make up for decades, frankly, maybe centuries, of inequality of application of health care to people of color,” Pritkzer said..  And people should remember the virus “doesn’t discriminate,” Pritzker said. The best way to stay healthy is to take steps to not get the virus..  “The one thing you can do, that everybody can do, is stay home. Make sure that you are wiping down surfaces. … This is true for everybody, no matter the color of your skin or where you’re from,” he said..

852,"People walk along a busy street in Garfield Park on Wednesday, April 1, 2020. (WTTW News).  The novel coronavirus is believed to more severely impact those who are elderly, immunocompromised or who otherwise have underlying health conditions like heart disease, lung disease or diabetes..   But there is another group that appears to be disproportionately impacted by COVID-19: those who identify as black..  Demographic data from the Illinois Department of Public Health shows that individuals classified as black make up 29% of the state’s confirmed COVID-19 cases. Individuals classified as white follow with 28% of the state’s confirmed cases, while the race of 24% of individuals who tested positive was “left blank.” Hispanics make up roughly 9% of cases, Asians just over 3% and “other” stand at 5%..  Those percentages do not align with the state’s racial makeup, per census data that as of last July showed Illinois’ population to be nearly 77% white, nearly 15% black, 17% Latino and almost 6% Asian..  (Graphic: Illinois Department of Public Health).  Black individuals also account for an outsized 113, or 41%, of Illinois’ 274 coronavirus-related deaths, compared with 106, or almost 39%, of white individuals who died after testing positive for the virus..  “We know all too well that there are general disparities in health outcomes that play along these racial lines, and the same may be true for this virus,” Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said Sunday. “We have worked to ensure that all of our communities can access the health care they need as COVID-19 spreads and we will make sure that resources are directed where they are needed most.”.  Ezike said the state has tried to address health care disparities among “black and brown communities” before the coronavirus hit and will continue to do so “both now and long after this pandemic has been conquered.”.  When pressed for details at his daily press briefing Sunday , the governor pointed to plans to temporarily reopen Melrose Park’s shuttered Westlake Hospital and the closed MetroSouth hospital in Blue Island, to serve as relief health care centers as the virus is expected to continue to surge in the Chicago area..  “But it’s hard to make up for decades, frankly, maybe centuries of inequality of application of health care to people,” Pritzker said..  He recommended that Illinois’ black population do “what can they do to protect themselves” by taking the measures he and other officials have been urging for weeks, including staying home, wiping down frequently touched surfaces and consistently hand-washing..  Pritzker, who donned a mask as he walked to the podium Sunday, also encouraged the public to wear face protection that covers the mouth and nose when and if they do go outside..  “I’m praying as I look at the potential for peaking in the next couple of weeks that we’ll be able to manage through this with the resources that we have but I’m not fully confident of that,” the governor said..

853,"So far, the state has a total of 11,256 known cases, including 274 deaths. A week ago, on March 30, Illinois had reported 5,057 cases and 73 deaths. The daily reported cases in Illinois have generally gone up and down over the past week, with four days reporting more than 900 new daily cases and three days under that threshold. On Friday and Saturday, the daily new case count was more than 1,000. Ezike has cautioned it is too early to draw conclusions about the overall statewide trend from the daily numbers. Gov. J.B. Pritzker answers a reporter's question during the daily press briefing on COVID-19 at the Thompson Center on April 1, 2020, in Chicago.(John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune).  On Sunday, there were 19 new deaths in Cook County, four in DuPage County and three in Kane County..  New counties reporting cases were Boone, Calhoun and Gallatin counties, bringing the total number of counties affected to 71. The age of those with known cases ranges from younger than 1 to more than 100 years old..  The widespread nature of the virus has meant medical facilities across the state need masks for nurses and doctors and ventilators for patients. But the lack of equipment, Pritzker said, and the way the federal government squandered late winter intelligence briefings, reports and advice from medical advisers that the virus was heading to the U.S. has meant that Illinois is “competing against the very people who are supposed to be your allies.”.  A review of federal purchasing contracts by The Associated Press shows federal agencies largely waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, ventilators and other equipment needed by health care workers. By that time, hospitals in several states were treating thousands of infected patients without adequate equipment and were pleading for shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile..  Pritzker said he has “given up on the federal government, honestly, really showing up in a way that I think we all would have expected them to.” Advertisement Pritzker’s pointed remarks about Washington’s response to the pandemic during the afternoon news conference came after he criticized federal officials during a morning interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” program with Jake Tapper..  On the show, the governor said Illinois needs thousands more ventilators than the federal government plans to give it. Pritzker requested 4,000 ventilators from the federal government last Tuesday, and Vice President Mike Pence responded, saying Illinois only needed 1,400, according to the interview. Pritzker said Pence was looking at a model from the University of Washington that, while good, was not intended for resource allocation. He said Pence pulled from a central data point that didn’t account for worst-case scenarios, which actually indicated a need for “5 or 6 or 7,000 more” than what the federal government has given Illinois..  “We’re looking at all of the numbers and everybody is taking an educated guess because we really don’t know — this virus is unpredictable,” Pritzker said in the interview..  The state is looking “everywhere and anywhere across the world to get ventilators,” Pritzker said, expressing frustration about President Donald Trump’s deferred deployment of the Defense Protection Act, a point Pritzker has made numerous times. One of the companies deployed, General Motors, won’t have ventilators ready until May or June, which may be too late if the virus peaks in April in Illinois as predicted by some models the state is using..  In his evening news conference, as he detailed the number of ventilators being sent to states, Trump called out Pritzker repeatedly: “Amazingly 600 (ventilators) will be going or have gone to Illinois. And, I mean there’s a governor I hear him complaining all the time, Pritzker. I hear him. He’s always complaining.”.  Trump also pointed to federal contributions to helping to convert McCormick Place into an alternative care facility that will eventually be able to hold 3,000 beds for patients, most of whom would have mild symptoms and not require intensive care.

See all newsletters..  At his afternoon news conference, Pritzker also said he is “deeply concerned” by health statistics that show the coronavirus disproportionately affecting African Americans in the state. Illinois health officials report that 30% of positive coronavirus cases in Illinois are African Americans. According to census figures, 14.6% of the Illinois population is African American..  “I’ve seen these stats, not just for Illinois, but also for Michigan and for a couple of other states where it’s also true,” Pritzker said..  The governor said that opening previously shuttered hospitals during this pandemic is one way to help serve communities of color. “But it is a much broader problem than over the course or three or four or five weeks here where we’ve been dealing with this pandemic,” Pritzker said. “That it’s hard to make up for decades, frankly, maybe centuries, of inequality of application of health care to people of color.”.  The governor also announced the expansion of support for essential workers’ child care needs and an increase in financial support for emergency child care centers and homes. All essential workers in health care, human services, essential government services and essential infrastructure now qualify for the state’s Child Care Assistance Program, which will cover most of the cost of care provided by emergency child care centers and homes. The eligibility expansion includes nurses and doctors, hospital support staff, grocery store workers and food producers.

857,"While black residents comprise 29% of Chicago, they represent 70% of that city's COVID-19 deaths. There are a number of reasons for that, and officials are just now beginning to address the issue..  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:.  Now COVID-19 is hitting black Chicagoans hard. Of course, baseline health disparities play a role, and many African Americans in Chicago are considered essential workers, holding down jobs driving buses or working in grocery stores. As the pandemic continues to bring health and economic hardship, there are calls for attention to underlying racial inequities. From member station WBEZ in Chicago, Natalie Moore reports..  NATALIE MOORE, BYLINE: While black residents make up about 29% of Chicago's population, a whopping 72% of the people who've die from COVID-19 in Chicago so far are black. That's according to cases analyzed from Cook County medical examiner records..  Linda Rae Murray is a retired doctor who teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago's School of Public Health. She says this high mortality rate for blacks doesn't surprise her..  LINDA RAE MURRAY: It makes me furious. It makes me angry. For African Americans, we have higher rates of diabetes, higher rates of high blood pressure, higher rates of coronary diseases and many other medical conditions that make people more vulnerable to having bad outcomes with this virus..  MOORE: The first person in Illinois to die of COVID-19 last month was a black woman named Patricia Frieson. A week later, her sister Wanda Bailey died. Both had underlying health conditions. Again, while 29% of Chicagoans are black, the city's health commissioner says they account for 52% of those testing positive so far. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot says the numbers take her breath away..  (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING).  LORI LIGHTFOOT: This is a call-to-action moment for all of us. When we talk about equity and inclusion, they're not just nice notions. They're an imperative that we must embrace as a city. It's unacceptable. No one should think that this is OK..  MOORE: Mayor Lightfoot announced a racial equity rapid response team. The idea is to work with community leaders to create a system of checking in on people and monitor what's happening and then direct resources to vulnerable communities. While stay-at-home orders may be effective for people who can telework, local and national data show more of those employees are white, higher-wage workers. According to census data in Chicago, blacks and Latinos are more likely to be essential workers, holding down jobs like cooks and janitors. In addition, minority communities don't have equal access to health care. And the pandemic death toll underscores just how crucial health insurance is. Lightfoot says social distancing can be hard in communities where people must take the bus or live closer together. And, she says, the urgency of this crisis brings all these issues to light..  (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING).  LIGHTFOOT: They are literally matters of life and death..  MOORE: Helene Gayle agrees. She has the Chicago Community Trust, which is co-managing a COVID relief fund. She's a former CEO of an international humanitarian group that helps communities recover from disasters like earthquakes and famine..  HELENE GAYLE: We used to talk about building back better and that when communities were impacted, whether it was by natural or human emergencies, can we use the work that we're doing in emergency response to actually build a bridge to longer-term (ph) so that we are building greater resiliency?.  MOORE: Gayle says it would be impossible to learn from this pandemic without considering the role racial disparity is playing..  For NPR News, I'm Natalie Moore in Chicago..

858,"/PRNewswire/ -- According to new surveys from ROI Rocket, a leading providing of market research-based consulting, former vice president Joe Biden is poised to win the three largest states holding primaries tomorrow by substantial margins. These polls project Biden will outperform Senator Bernie Sanders (D- Vermont ) by about 67% to 27% in Florida , 61% to 33% in Ohio and 57% to 34% in Illinois . The estimated margins of victory in these races are well above the error rates associated with the results, though potential responses to the coronavirus epidemic may impact these numbers, particularly if older voters stay home in large numbers..  After breaking out of the pack on Super Tuesday, Biden has only increased his delegate lead, winning five out of six contests in last week's primaries. The situation has left many Sanders supporters wondering where to throw their support. At present, across Florida , Ohio and Illinois , about 22% of Sanders supporters say they're likely to vote for someone other than Biden or decline to vote altogether..  At the same time, support for Biden continues to be decidedly lackluster. There's comparatively little enthusiasm for the candidate and he's yet to make a strong emotional connection with many Democratic primary voters. Taken together, disaffection among Sanders supporters and broad but shallow support for Biden cast serious doubt on the Democratic Party's chances of taking the White House in November..  State-specific Details.  Florida : Only about 61% of Biden's supporters are enthusiastic while just 53% feel an emotional connection. About 21% of Sanders supporters say they won't vote for Biden in November—6% say they'll vote for Trump, 8% for a third party and 7% will stay home..  Ohio : Only 48% of Biden's supporters are enthusiastic and about two-in-five (40%) feel an emotional connection. As for Sanders supporters, about 28% say they won't vote for Biden in November, 6% say they'll vote for Trump, 14% for a third party and 8% will stay home..  Illinois : Significantly less than half of Biden voters (about 41%) are enthusiastic supporters and only 39% feel an emotional connection. If Biden is the nominee, about 7% of Sanders supporters say they'll vote for Trump, 11% for a third party and 5% won't vote at all..  ABOUT THIS RESEARCH.  This research was fielded from March 6 – 12, 2020. To qualify for this study, respondents were required to be registered voters likely to vote in the 2020 presidential election. Sample collection was balanced to state-specific U.S. Census numbers for gender, age, ethnicity and urban/suburban/rural residency. In addition, we also established minimum quotas based on party identification to ensure reliable sub-group analyses..  In addition, appropriate weights have been applied based on U.S. Census figures for state population, gender and age, along with party membership..  Discrete sample samples and associated margins of error are noted below. All margins of error have been calculated at the 95% confidence level in the most conservative case. • Florida sample (closed primary, Democrats only): n=877 (MoE: +/- 3.3%) Illinois sample (open primary, Democrats and Independents): n=960 (MoE: +/- 3.1%) Ohio sample (open primary, Democrats and Independents): n=880 (MoE: +/- 3.3%).

Molly Beestrum, MLIS, education and curriculum coordinator for the Galter Health Sciences Library and Learning Center , has been named Illinois Academic Librarian of the Year by the Illinois Library Association (ILA). The award, presented by the ILA Illinois Association of College and Research Libraries Forum, recognizes an Illinois librarian’s outstanding statewide contribution to academic or research librarianship and to library development..  “I have been an academic librarian my entire career, and it is incredibly rewarding and humbling to be recognized this way,” Beestrum said. “So much of librarianship depends on collaboration and teamwork, so I can’t reflect on this award without thinking of the generous mentors early in my career, and of the remarkable, dedicated colleagues I’ve had in academia and in the Illinois Library Association.”.  Beestrum’s career as an academic librarian spans more than 15 years, having held positions at various academic institutions around Chicago before joining Galter as its education and curriculum coordinator in September 2018..  In this role, Beestrum is the point person for all curricular and student-centered library support at Galter. Specifically, she helps conduct orientation and resource sessions for all new student groups; meets with students for consults on Area of Scholarly Concentration research; offers capstone and thesis support; coordinates systematic reviews; provides resource support and literature searches; and works with program faculty to determine how best to promote information literacy in Feinberg’s student body. Beestrum is also the co-chair of the Galter Diversity and Inclusion Working Group and serves on Galter’s Reference Working Group and Systematic Review Working Group..  “Molly’s innovative and user-focused approach has strengthened partnerships with educational programs across campus, created more effective ways to support information literacy, and has contributed significantly to Galter’s support of our shared mission to ‘impact the practice of medicine through discovery and education.’ We are absolutely thrilled to see this recognition of her outstanding efforts on behalf of the students and faculty in the Feinberg School of Medicine, and look forward to her continuing leadership on new opportunities to support student and trainee success,” said Kristi Holmes, PhD , director of the Galter Health Sciences Library and professor of Preventive Medicine in the Division of Health and Biomedical Informatics and of Medical Education ..  While Beestrum’s role has had its challenges, such as the learning curve that comes with understanding Feinberg’s curriculum and various programs, working with students continues to be the most rewarding part of her job, she said..  “I love meeting with students one-on-one and learning about their projects. Instructing students and connecting Galter resources to their coursework is incredibly gratifying. I get to see their excitement when they learn about a database that helps them with their project, or their relief they when realize that I can assist them with their literature searches,” Beestrum said..  Beestrum is also a member of the ILA Executive Board and served as ILA president from 2019 to 2020. As ILA president, Beestrum led the organization through providing daily updates with resources for reliable and accurate information about the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Census, and community activism and support in response to the nation’s increasing call for racial and social justice. She also advocated for the protection of library staff and the public and the implementation of measures to reduce community transmission of COVID-19..  “The Galter Health Sciences Library and Learning Center is a next-generation fully integrated knowledge management hub for the Feinberg School of Medicine. It enables innovative ways of partnering to advance education and research because of its dedicated professionals, and recognition of Molly’s successes by her peers is well earned. We are grateful for her many accomplishments supporting development of tomorrow’s healthcare providers and excited for her continued leadership,” said Richard D’Aquila, MD , the Howard Taylor Ricketts, MD, Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases , associate vice president of research, for Clinical and Translational Research, director of the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute ( NUCATS ) and a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University..  Beestrum will be honored with the award during the 2020 Illinois Library Association Annual Conference, which will be held virtually in October.","[0.5008282661437988, 0.4991717040538788]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5008282661437988
869,"Home WP Original Stories ‘Seismic Disruption’: Chicago Estimates Combined Budget Shortfall of $2 billion for This... ‘Seismic Disruption’: Chicago Estimates Combined Budget Shortfall of $2 billion for This Year And Next – Wirepoints September 1, 2020 Print.  By: Ted Dabrowski, John Klingner and Mark Glennon.  Chicago on Monday released its budget forecast for 2021 accompanied by an address from Mayor Lori Lightfoot. The forecast and speech are part of the annual run-up to completion of the coming year’s budget..  Illinois faces a “seismic disruption” of its economy, Lightfoot said. Unfortunately she offered no seismic response or reforms, just vague aspirations and stronger rhetoric..  Let’s look at some of the key things the report and Lightfoot said and break them down: The budget shortfall – the “official” one – will hit $800 million this year and $1.2 billion in 2021..  In truth, nobody knows how bad the shortfall will get because we have no idea how long other things will persist, including riots, the pandemic and the city’s response to the pandemic in the form of lockdown rules. Nor do we know how quickly flight from the city will accelerate. The “seismic disruption” of Chicago’s economy means 2021 requires a “pandemic” budget. “Also affecting the recovery was looting and damage to our businesses that occurred three months ago and again more recently,” she said..  That’s certainly true, but what changed since April? Then, she said, “I think we’re very well-situated to weather this storm because we anticipated in our budget forecast for 2020 that we would experience in this year some kind of economic downturn…. Now, nobody anticipated that it would be due to a pandemic. But we built the budget this year to be able to be responsive to that kind of worst-case scenario.”.  The seismic disruption was clear long ago, but no aggressive steps were taken to address it, and Lightfoot announced no new ones..  And what kind of “pandemic budget” in a city with a shrinking population that was already broke calls for a spending increase of over 11%? That’s the projected increase from 2020 to 2021 shown in the report..  It’s a similar story for Chicago schools, which have a separate budget. CPS spending is set to go up by 7 percent in 2021. Property tax increase, layoffs and furloughs? Maybe, but she said those “are at the end of my list of tools and options.”.  Layoffs and pay cuts should have been implemented years ago..  Budget steps will probably include use of federal stimulus funds, another $100 million in savings from debt refinancing and further unspecified cuts and borrowing.

870,"By Ted Dabrowski, John Klingner and Mark Glennon | Sep 2, 2020.  Chicago on Monday released its budget forecast for 2021 accompanied by an address from Mayor Lori Lightfoot. The forecast and speech are part of the annual run-up to completion of the coming year’s budget..  Illinois faces a “seismic disruption” of its economy, Lightfoot said. Unfortunately she offered no seismic response or reforms, just vague aspirations and stronger rhetoric..  Let’s look at some of the key things the report and Lightfoot said and break them down:.  The budget shortfall – the “official” one – will hit $800 million this year and $1.2 billion in 2021. In truth, nobody knows how bad the shortfall will get because we have no idea how long other things will persist, including riots, the pandemic and the city’s response to the pandemic in the form of lockdown rules. Nor do we know how quickly flight from the city will accelerate..  The “seismic disruption” of Chicago’s economy means 2021 requires a “pandemic” budget. “Also affecting the recovery was looting and damage to our businesses that occurred three months ago and again more recently,” she said. That’s certainly true, but what changed since April? Then, she said, “I think we’re very well-situated to weather this storm because we anticipated in our budget forecast for 2020 that we would experience in this year some kind of economic downturn…. Now, nobody anticipated that it would be due to a pandemic. But we built the budget this year to be able to be responsive to that kind of worst-case scenario.”.  The seismic disruption was clear long ago, but no aggressive steps were taken to address it, and Lightfoot announced no new ones..  And what kind of “pandemic budget” in a city with a shrinking population that was already broke calls for a spending increase of over 11%? That’s the projected increase from 2020 to 2021 shown in the report..  It’s a similar story for Chicago schools, which have a separate budget. CPS spending is set to go up by 7 percent in 2021..  Property tax increase, layoffs and furloughs? Maybe, but she said those “are at the end of my list of tools and options.” Layoffs and pay cuts should have been implemented years ago.

Budget steps will probably include use of federal stimulus funds, another $100 million in savings from debt refinancing and further unspecified cuts and borrowing.

Chicago was the extreme outlier among big cities long before the pandemic on pensions, credit ratings, finances, home values, and more..  Tax increment finance districts — TIFs — will be raided for their surpluses, Lightfoot clearly indicated. TIF surpluses, however, do not reliably produce recurring revenue. They are little more than slush funds, it’s widely agreed, and how much of a surplus is available is unclear..  The crisis requires “reimagining” the city’s workforce, Lightfoot said, and “making needed changes in places that are not being fully utilized during the remainder of this crisis and in our post-COVID-19 world.” What that means, if anything, is unknown..

871,".  (Undated, IL) -- Illinois is losing more people than any state in the country. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Illinois' population has dropped by about 168-thousand-700 people since 2010, more than double number-two West Virginia. Illinois' population is also declining at the second-fastest rate, more than one percent in the last decade.

872,"Chicagoans who venture to other cities have long noticed that many of them enjoy a profusion of something that’s not so easy to find here: food trucks. Chicago has its share of people with adventurous dining tastes and money to spend. But it has more than its share of restrictions on this culinary innovation — and locals are deprived as a result..  That’s why we’re glad to see that Mayor Lori Lightfoot is offering an ordinance to loosen the reins. It would extend the time a truck could stay in one spot from two hours to four. It would also let food trucks operate from any legal parking space, scrapping the rule that they must stay 200 feet away from any bricks-and-mortar restaurant, which puts most of the Loop off-limits..  Advertisement The existing requirements were designed to serve the interests of restaurants, but not diners. After the ordinance was enacted in 2012, the number of food trucks in the city fell sharply. One operator who had to quit her mobile business was cupcake baker Laura Pekarik, who sued to overturn the rules. But in May, the Illinois Supreme Court upheld them as a reasonable way to protect restaurants from free-market competition..  But why should restaurants get protection? They offer an entirely different dining experience that happens to be more popular than ever. Restaurant food and drink sales have boomed over the past decade, even as the food truck business was enjoying rapid growth..  There is room in the meal marketplace for both types of business, catering to different needs. Sometimes you want an Italian meal over a bottle of wine or a place to sip coffee while tapping at your laptop; sometimes you want a taco or a lobster roll to eat on the go. Some days you want to have your lunch on a park bench while soaking up the sun, and some days you want to be in a cozy booth out of the elements..  The mayor’s changes would help Chicago shed its reputation for being hostile to a form of food delivery that suits 21st-century tastes and lifestyles. A 2018 survey published by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranked Chicago 13th nationally in receptiveness to movable feasts. “The experience of operating a food truck in Chicago is perhaps one of the most difficult in the country,” it concluded. By contrast, Indianapolis ranked fifth, thanks to simple, generous rules and low permit fees..  Kudos to the mayor for bringing a new approach, which her office describes as just one of her “latest efforts to support innovative business types and creative owners.” She even won the support of the Illinois Restaurant Association, which said, “By expanding operating hours for food trucks, Chicago is encouraging innovation while balancing the interests of both food trucks and restaurants.”.

879,"Illinois lost nearly 105,000 people in net domestic migration between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2019, according to new numbers released Monday by the U.S. Census Bureau. In total, the Land of Lincoln lost on net 51,250 people, the largest annual population decline this decade..  It’s the sixth consecutive year Illinois’ population declined. The 51,250 in net population loss is roughly the size of the village of Hoffman Estates in suburban Chicago or Normal in downstate McLean County..  Last year, Illinois dropped from the fifth to the sixth most populous state, losing an estimated 45,000 people and falling behind Pennsylvania. In 2017, Illinois lost around 40,000 people. In 2016, there was a loss around 38,000 people. In 2015, there was a loss of around 25,000. In 2014, there was a loss of around 10,000..  The cumulative total is almost 160,000 lost from Illinois in the past 10 years..  “It’s kind of a disturbing trend because we’re looking at if it holds out next year that we’ll probably be losing at least one congressional seat so that certainly cuts into our congressional representation,” Northern Illinois University Senior Research Associate Brian Harger said Monday. “It also impacts some of our eligibility for federal aid.”.

Population losses come with a myriad of financial implications for Illinois officials. Many federal grants and other assistance is calculated based on population.

880,"Illinois lost nearly 105,000 people in net domestic migration between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2019, according to new numbers released Monday by the U.S. Census Bureau. In total, the Land of Lincoln lost on net 51,250 people, the largest annual population decline this decade..  It’s the sixth consecutive year Illinois’ population declined. The 51,250 in net population loss is roughly the size of the village of Hoffman Estates in suburban Chicago or Normal in downstate McLean County..  Last year, Illinois dropped from the fifth to the sixth most populous state, losing an estimated 45,000 people and falling behind Pennsylvania. In 2017, Illinois lost around 40,000 people. In 2016, there was a loss around 38,000 people. In 2015, there was a loss of around 25,000. In 2014, there was a loss of around 10,000..  The cumulative total is almost 160,000 lost from Illinois in the past 10 years..  “It’s kind of a disturbing trend because we’re looking at if it holds out next year that we’ll probably be losing at least one congressional seat so that certainly cuts into our congressional representation,” Northern Illinois University Senior Research Associate Brian Harger said Monday. “It also impacts some of our eligibility for federal aid.”.

881,"Illinois plans on spending $400 million over the next several years to improve internet access to farms and small towns..  But first, the state needs to know who has a reliable internet connection and who doesn’t..  The federal government tracks where high-speed internet is available. But the mapping has been criticized for overstating access, particularly in rural areas. Around 30 percent of residents living in rural Illinois lack internet access at speeds of 25 mbps and above, according to a report from the Federal Communications Commission..  Matt Schmit, director of the new Illinois Office of Broadband, said the office’s first project is developing the state’s own map, which it is currently looking for a third-party vendor to do..  “We can chart where we are today, where we want to go, and the progress that we’re making on an annual basis,” Schmit said..  He said the mapping program will include information from internet service providers and customers..  “We want to have a continuing conversation with broadband stakeholders… who may have different experiences when it comes to broadband service in one part of the state, and a map might be telling a different story,” he said. “And we're going to try to reconcile that difference, just so we're able to make the best investments we can in the areas that needed the most.”.  Right now, telecommunication companies report to the Federal Communications Commission by census tract where they offer internet and at what speeds. The problem, according to broadband advocates, is that if internet access is available to even one house in the census tract, that area is considered served..  Illinois’ congressional delegation asked the Federal Communications Commission for specific changes to its process last summer..  “What should be of great concern to government, the telecommunications industry, and American consumers is the significant lack of detail, accuracy, and granularity of these broadband maps,” the letter reads ..  They said the current process can keep small internet companies or cooperatives from qualifying for needed money to build infrastructure and serve more rural customers..  Schmit previously was a lawmaker in Minnesota and helped start a broadband program there..  The program developed its own statewide map, said Angie Dickison, manager of the Minnesota Broadband Office. She said the state looked at broadband access by service area, instead of census block..  “That gives us a little bit better look at where the coverage actually exists,” Dickison said..  Under Minnesota law, the state aims for everyone to have 25 mbps download speeds by 2022. Currently, around 93% of the population has that, up from 70% in 2011..  Illinois’ law does not have a specific speed or access goal set, but Schmit said his office will develop the goals with its Broadband Advisory Council ..  Illinois lawmakers earmarked money for the projects in its multibillion dollar infrastructure plan, funded by a combination of tax increases and an expansion of gambling..  Schmit said the broadband office plans in early 2020 to give out the first round of grant funding to build internet infrastructure. Copyright 2020 NPR Illinois | 91.9 UIS.

886,"Agricultural census data allows tracking of acres operated by farms of different sizes. We use this data to track grain farm concentration over time. Acres operated by farms with over 2,000 acres has risen from 16.0 percent of Illinois acres in 1997 to 32.9 percent in 2017..  Unless some unforeseen event changes agriculture, the trend of higher acres operated by larger farmers will continue. The geography of concentration varies across Illinois counties. Census Data on Farm Size.  Table 1 contains the percent of harvested acres by farm size category. Data come from the U.S. Census of Agriculture and are available from the National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) through the Quick Stats website. Data are available for each census year from 1997 to the present. Census years are five years apart. Click Image to Enlarge.  There are two panels in Table 1. Panel A shows percent of acres operated by different farm sizes in groups that come from NASS. These percentages are summarized into three groups in Panel B: Less than 1,000 acres includes all size categories below 1,000 acres in Panel A. 1,000 to 1,999 acres is the same category from Panel A. Over 2,000 acres is the sum of the 2,000 to 4,999 and over 5,000 acre categories in Panel A..  The focus in the remainder of this article will be on values in Panel B. Growth in Concentration over Time.  In 2017, 39.8 percent of farmland in Illinois was operated by farms of less than 1,000 acres (see the final column in Panel B, Table 1). Farms with from 1,000 to 1,999 acres farmed 27.3% of the acres, and farm with over 2,000 acres farmed 32.9% of acres. The sum of the three categories for each year equals 100 percent..  Three trends are evident in Panel B of Table 1. First, farms with less than 1,000 acres are losing control of Illinois farmland, going from 57.6 percent in 1997 to 39.8 percent in 2017. Declines occurred in each census year. From 1997 to 2017, farms with less than 1,000 acres decreased farming percentage by 18 percentage points (57.6 percent in 1997 – 39.8 percent in 2017)..  Second, farms in the 1,000 to 1,999 remained roughly stable in terms of percent of acres farmed, with an increase from 1997 to 2002, and then a decline after that. From 1997 to 2002, acres farmed increased from 26.5 percent to 30.2 percent. Then, the percentage declined each census year to 27.3 percent in 2017. In terms of percent operated, farms from 1,000 to 1,999 acres are roughly in the same position in 2017 as in 1997, but with a decreasing trend since 2002..  Third, farms with over 2,000 acres grew in acres operated. In 1997, farms with over 2,000 acres operated 16.0 percent of acres farmed in Illinois. In 2017, the percentage grew to 32.9 percent. An increase of about 3 percent occurred in each five-year period between censuses. Concentration by County.  Figure 1 shows the percent of acres operated by farms with over 2,000 acres by Illinois county in 2017. There is a considerable range across Illinois counties. The three highest percentages are in southern Illinois: Gallatin with 72%, White with 68%, and Lawrence with 56%. There are size counties that the census indicates that there are 0 percent farmed by over 2,000 acre farms: Cook, DuPage, Johnson, Lake, Pope, and Putnam. These 0 percent counties have limited agricultural farmland. Click Image to Enlarge.  In most of Illinois, the percentage of land operated by farms over 2,000 acres is less than 40% (see Figure 1. There are several notable exceptions. In northern Illinois, McHenry and Grundy Counties have over 45% of the farmland operated by farms with over 2000 acre..  In central Illinois, there are several counties with over 40% of acres operated by 2,000 plus acre farms: Sangamon (52%), Scott (51%), Moultrie (49%), Christian (48%), Mason (48%), and Piatt (46%). Many counties in south east and southern Illinois have over 40% of land farmed by 2,000 plus acre farms. Summary and Commentary.  As is well known, the percent of acres operated by larger farms has grown over time, with most of the acres coming from farms with less than 500 acres. One would expect those trends to continue. Even without any introductions of new technologies, there are powerful forces at work leading to increasing farm size. An increase to 36% of farmland operated by 2,000 plus acre farms should be expected in the 2022 census..  Perhaps surprisingly, the levels of concentration are uneven across Illinois. There are areas with higher concentration, particularly in central and southern Illinois. Overall, local market conditions likely play a significant role in acres operated by different farm sizes.","[0.5009470582008362, 0.4990529417991638]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5009470582008362
887,"Chicago Tribune | May 14, 2020 | 5:18 PM Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, left, chats with county Treasurer Maria Pappas before delivering her budget address in 2015.(Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) For months, Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas has been working on plans to alter property tax deadlines in her office. She moved this year’s May tax sale to protect homeowners with back taxes due, and weeks ago began coordinating with President Toni Preckwinkle to waive interest fees that pile up on late payers..  “I submit that means relief for our people,” she wrote to Preckwinkle on April 29 of the waiver push. “Too many are jobless. They fear becoming homeless. We must act.” Advertisement.  The Cook County Board at its May 21 meeting is expected to vote on the plan to waive two months of interest penalties that would start accumulating after Cook County’s Aug. 3 property tax deadline. About a dozen other counties have approved measures aimed at some form of property tax relief due to COVID-19 layoffs and shutdowns..  If approved, the altered waiver schedule could delay the disbursement of money to taxing bodies — schools, cities, libraries, park districts. Those are the entities funded by local property tax revenue; in hard hit regions of Chicago, including the south suburbs, taxing bodies for decades have been forced to jack up their tax rates due to declining property values, delinquent properties and the flight of businesses and homeowners to more tax-friendly states. It’s a vicious cycle perpetuated by inaction on the part of state elected officials to address skyrocketing pension costs that squeeze local governments. Advertisement.  Still, the county board should approve the Pappas-Preckwinkle proposal to waive late fees. It would give property owners throughout Cook County time to catch up. To take a breath. “The problem with the (Aug. 3) due date is that people don’t have the money,” Pappas said. That pretty much says it all..  Restaurant owners, apartment landlords, mom-and-pop businesses that have been closed, and homeowners out of a job deserve a break. Property tax bills in Cook County can be unforgiving, both for the homeowner in struggling Ford Heights and in the Gold Coast. Gov. J.B. Pritzker, for example, paid more than $156,000 for the first installment of property taxes this year on his Astor Street estate, not including the mansion he bought next door, according to county property tax records. He’ll owe about the same this summer for the second installment on the main house..  The neighboring Pritzker property is the one that got him in trouble with the Cook County inspector general for allegedly removing toilets in 2015 during a rehab project to lower the home’s assessment. Pritzker ended up repaying the county about $330,00 in 2018, just before his election as governor, for the value of the breaks he received. On that property, he paid a first installment tax bill of more than $82,000 earlier this year, records show..  Of course there are bigger, broader and more complicated property tax dilemmas facing Illinois than toilet removal schemes — though that one was a doozy and, at one point, caught the eye of federal investigators, according to WBEZ ..  The state’s high property tax burden due to thousands of layers of local governments, expensive labor contracts and uncontrolled pension costs continue to drive residents and businesses to lower-cost states. For the sixth straight year, Illinois’ population dropped last year while every bordering state’s population grew. The state legislature could have put an amendment on the fall ballot to ease pension costs. Lawmakers could lower workers’ compensation costs for businesses. They could reduce state mandates that hike up the costs of doing business. They could do more to enable local governments including school districts to combine. They could cut state government costs instead of allowing the state budget to balloon each year. They could quit their addiction to borrowing..  But instead of tackling efficiencies, the latest property tax task force established by Pritzker last summer recommended — wait for it — higher sales taxes. Even Pritzker threw cold water on that idea while Republicans complained of being left out of the discussion. “For a state that is so in need of property tax reform, the Democrats have instead proposed tax increases,” House GOP Leader Jim Durkin said in January of the task force’s recommendations. “Heaven help the middle class.”.  Lawmakers did move to consolidate downstate pubic safety pension funds, which is designed to improve investment returns. We’ll see..  But nibbling around the edges won’t solve the property tax problems of Illinois. Treasurer Pappas over the years has included more information on Cook County property tax bills and on her website to illuminate the cash crunch. Last year, she began listing the raw numbers of active employees paying into a particular pension fund, and the number of retirees depending on that pension fund, for each Cook County taxing body including Chicago’s..  For 169 governmental bodies, the numbers were lopsided. In some cases thousands more retirees were drawing from a fund than active workers were paying into it. One example: Even at the small Arlington Heights Park District, 432 retirees were pulling from that district’s pension fund with only 103 active employees paying into it.

Have our elected officials done it? Not in Springfield, leaving it to county officials to do what they can. In this case, the Cook County Board will be presented with waiving interest fees on late tax payments. It’s worth doing.

Alvarez characterized the census as “the one way we really have to twist the government’s arm to represent you and invest in you.”.  “We all win when we’re all counted,” he said..  Some of the hardest-to-count communities Schuyler’s organization serves have the most to lose in an undercount. Those communities are often reliant on local health departments, and a complete count is essential to ensuring they receive adequate funding..  “The census numbers are utilized by the US government to determine the government pass-through funds that go to health and well-being programs like health departments, Medicare, Medicaid, the Head Start programs, all kinds of education programs, Pell Grants, school lunches, senior programs like Meals on Wheels, and the various senior transportation systems,” she said..

A new study found that Illinois is one of the loudest states in the country. Iowa may lose its hearing by the time I'm done typing up this article..  Noise pollution is a real thing. You especially get more of in bigger cities. Traffic, people, construction, and more play into noise pollution. But what states give off the most noise? Think about where the big cities are at and I bet you will guess correctly which states are the loudest..  Fortunately for us, Zippia wondered the same thing. So to find out which states are the loudest and which ones are the quietest, Zippia ranked each state 1-to-50 in 4 categories: Home size (Smaller homes are louder) Household/family size (The more people living together, the more noise) People per Sq. Mile (The more people, the noisier the state) Cars per Sq. Mile (The more cars, the noisier the state).  They looked at Realtor.com average home size, they used Census data to find the average number of people living in homes in each state, they looked at Statista for data on car registrations per state, came from Statista , and they usedCensus data to find each state’s population density..  After all of that math and data research, here is what they found:.  New Jersey was the loudest state according to Zippia. New Jersey has an average house size of 1,740 square feet , they have 1,207 people per square mile, and they have 371 cars per square mile..  Illinois was not far behind New Jersey. Zippia found that Illinois ranked as the 5th loudest state. Illinois has an average house size of 1,632 square feet , they have 231 people per square mile, and they have 81 cars per square mile..  What about on the other side of the river in Iowa ? Iowa ranked as the 32nd loudest state. Iowa has an average house size of 1,550 square feet , they have 55 people per square mile, and they have 22 cars per square mile.","[0.6782509684562683, 0.3217490017414093]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6782509684562683
891,"By Joe Barrett.  CHICAGO -- Chicago officials projected a record $1.2 billion budget gap for 2021, as the coronavirus pandemic wallops economic activity and increases city expenses..  For the current year, the nation's third-largest city is already facing a nearly $800 million shortfall in its projected $4.4 billion budget, essentially for the same reasons. It hopes to close that gap by year-end through a combination of coronavirus-related help from the federal government, debt refinancing, hiring slowdowns and service cuts..  ""It is clear that without another round of federal stimulus funding, Chicago, like many other cities, will be facing a set of very hard choices,"" said Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, in prepared remarks..  Officials said in a press release that the city had made strides to fix its structural budget problems, and that most of the shortfalls for this year and next are attributed to the pandemic..  Still, the city faces one of the nation's largest unfunded pension liabilities and has been suffering from population decline, which also saps economic growth..  One glimmer of hope is the passage of legislation for a city casino, whose revenues will be dedicated to police and fire union pensions, easing the future burden on the general fund..  Ms. Lightfoot said in a press conference that the city would aim to continue investment in community safety and neighborhood improvements to address a surge in violent crime on its South and West sides..

892,"OMAHA, Neb. — As food banks have struggled to meet soaring demand from people suddenly out of work because of the coronavirus pandemic, it has been especially troubling to see farmers have to bury produce, dump milk and euthanize hogs..  Now some states are providing more money to help pay for food that might otherwise go to waste, the U.S. Agriculture Department is spending $3 billion to help get farm products to food banks, and a senator is seeking $8 billion more to buy farm produce for food banks..  ""Obviously nobody likes to see waste of good food,"" said Mark Quandt, executive director of the Regional Food Bank of Northeastern New York. ""And to know that farmers put so much work and money and energy into producing the product. That's got to be breaking their heart to then have to just dump product like that or just throw it away or plow it under."" ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT.  Farmers were left with little choice after the closure of restaurants and schools abruptly ended much of the demand for the food they produced..  Thousands of acres of Florida fruits and vegetables and California's leafy greens have been plowed over or left to rot. Meanwhile, dairy farmers in Vermont, New York and Wisconsin have had to dump millions of gallons of milk. Hog farmers were hit by a drop in demand and the temporary closure of some slaughterhouses, forcing them to euthanize pigs that couldn't be processed into bacon and pork chops..  This has coincided with a spike in demand at food banks, with nearly 39 million people suddenly out of work. In Florida, for example, 12 food banks have had to scramble to increase deliveries from 6 million pounds of food per week to 10 million pounds..  A U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more than 10% of U.S. households reported not being able to get enough food some of the time or often, and a survey for the Data Foundation found that 37% of unemployed Americans ran out of food in the past month..  Thanks to various government and private efforts, at least some of the food that would have been wasted is now being delivered to the people who need it..  New York state created a $25 million program this spring so that food banks can purchase locally made agricultural products. Quandt said he is already planning to use the $4.3 million his food bank will receive to buy milk, cheese, yogurt, applesauce, grape juice and other products..  ""It will be a tremendous help,"" he said..  Chris Noble, who has a dairy farm about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Rochester, said the Nourish New York program gave him an outlet for some of the milk his coop was dumping and provided money to cover his costs. He worked with other farmers in western New York to send dairy products to a food bank in New York City..  ""It doesn't feel good to see our life's work go down the drain like that,"" said Noble. ""To be able to meet the needs of our community with the food we produce and not see it go to waste is really impactful."".  In Iowa, state officials and the Iowa Pork Producers Association have raised more than $130,000 to help pay for the processing of pigs to supply meat for food banks. The effort gives hog farmers such as Kevin Rasmussen an outlet so they won't have to euthanize their animals but it doesn't compensate them. So far, 364 pigs have been donated..  ""The last thing we want to do is waste anything,"" said Rasmussen, who donated seven pigs from his northern Iowa farm to the program this month. ""Everybody is doing everything they can to keep from euthanizing animals and throwing product away."".  Other states, such as Florida and California, had existing programs to help get donated crops to food banks by paying part of the cost of harvesting them. Those programs are getting a boost from donations now and California is adding $2 million to its state budget for its program..  The biggest effort is a $3 billion federal program aimed at buying fresh produce, dairy and meat and delivering it to food banks. That program has been slowed by questions about some of the companies that received the initial $1.2 billion contracts..  ""Some of the companies that got bids, people are kind of scratching their heads like 'wait this isn't a food distributor, why are they winning the award?'"" said Celia Cole, of the Feeding Texas association of food banks..  One of the companies that has received the most scrutiny is a San Antonio wedding and event planning company called CRE8AD8 that received one of the biggest contracts, worth roughly $39 million. Several large, well-known food distribution companies were passed over in the bidding in favor of smaller companies..  Brent Erenwert, CEO of Brothers Produce, a Houston-based produce distributor that applied but didn't get a contract, said he is concerned the USDA program will fall short of its goals because of the companies awarded contracts..  ""We've got a fiasco on our hands right here,"" Erenwert said. ""There's just no way or shape this will help the farmer or the end user that's going to need this product."".  USDA officials said they are confident the selected companies can complete the job..  Separately, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York has proposed spending $8 billion on fresh produce grown in 20 states and providing the crops to food banks. That proposal would provide money to food banks to purchase fruits, vegetables and nuts directly from farmers..  ___ ","[0.5092026591300964, 0.49079737067222595]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5092026591300964

894,"Why I left Chicago and moved to Madison.  By ESTHER J. CEPEDAMADISON, Wis. -- The first time I saw the dome of Wisconsin's capitol building, I was informed that -- way at the tippy-top -- there was a lady with a badger on her head..  It wasn't a joke. The gilded bronze statue is named ""Wisconsin,"" symbolizing the state motto ""Forward."" She's 15 feet, 5 inches tall, weighs over 3 tons and holds a globe with an eagle perched on it in her left hand and a badger, the state animal, on top of her helmet..  She's quite beautiful..  Just like the rest of Madison, which is a city I knew only because an internet acquaintance turned me on to Forward Madison, FC, the town's third-division pro soccer league. With its gorgeous uniforms and quirky social media presence, I got sucked into a fan vortex so strong that soon I was making weekly long trips from the northwest suburbs of Chicago to Madison, Wisconsin, home of the Flamingos..  The promise of a new life in a different place, with new people to love, made this Chicago girl flee suburban Illinois to peek behind the so-called Cheddar Curtain..  It's not that I needed to find out how good cheese curds taste (far better than their cringe-y name implies) but because my new home was either going to be Chicago, Los Angeles or Wisconsin -- and Madison won. Hands-down, no contest..  My youngest graduated from high school last year and, at that time, I leaned in to Chicago. I started trekking in from the 'burbs (where I'd fled to 18 years prior so that I'd have a snowball's chance at a home with a backyard and a decent school system for my babies). I loved to go to the concerts, comedy shows, podcast tapings, fan cub meetups, magic classes and other cultural events that make the Windy City so special..  But I found street congestion that was 20-years-worth of worse than it had been when I left for the suburbs in 1999. And neighborhoods that had once been solidly working class (read: affordable) were completely gentrified and unlivable unless you had tons of money to plow into rent or a sky-high mortgage..  The media business in Chicago was on its knees, as it continues to be, and teaching gigs at Chicago Public Schools promised to be heartbreakers..  In short, Chicago didn't have much to offer someone living a modest life and looking at retirement as the next major passage. Meanwhile, the state of Illinois, just like the city, was losing people like me at an astonishing rate..  In 2019, analysis of census data found that the Prairie State's population fell for the sixth year in a row. The local National Public Radio affiliate, WBEZ, estimated that 1,628,866 people left Illinois for other states from 2014 to 2018 -- up 15.6% from the number that left the state from 2009 to 2013..  Most people who left were in the ultra-desirable age bracket of 20-34, but the greatest increase of people leaving were those 65 and older (almost 50% more between 2014 to 2018), trailed closely by 50-64 year olds. And these people were more often middle- and high-income than low-income..  Reasons cited were job- and housing-related. The state's financial situation surely also had a role to play. Truthinaccounting.org recently gave the state an ""F"" grade after an analysis of the latest available audited financial reports found that every state taxpayer would have to kick in $52,000 to bail Illinois out of a debt burden of $226 billion, mostly due to underfunded pension obligations..  ""This report shows that Illinois went into the coronavirus pandemic with bad fiscal health, and it will probably come out of the crisis even worse,"" truthinaccounting.org 's analysis said..  The state is well known for being corrupt -- six Illinois governors have been charged with crimes, four were convicted, and Rod Blagojevich was the first to be impeached and removed from office, yet recently got a pass from President Donald Trump -- and the city of Chicago has its own reputation for corruption..  But it was Chicago's celebrated neighborhoods that made me sad every time I went into town..  The march of progress has made old tracts unaffordable and terribly bland, with the same chain pharmacies, coffee shops and fast food places replacing all the spots that had given the city so much character. Oh well..  My move to Madison isn't the only journey I'm on right now. After ten years of working as a syndicated columnist, I've decided to strike out to new pastures. I'm so grateful to all of my readers for your constant interest and support. I'll miss you, but you won't have to look too far to find me online..  And: Madison isn't called Mad City for nothing. Come visit me some time, there are plenty of dive bars and gritty restaurants -- and a golden lady with a badger on her head will be here to greet you.Esther Cepeda's email address is or follow her on Twitter @estherjcepeda.(c) 2020, Washington Post Writers Group Posted at 06:22 PM | Permalink","[0.5025551319122314, 0.49744483828544617]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5025551319122314
895,"US job losses in May could raise 3-month total to 30 million By Christopher Rugaber Associated Press | Jun 03, 2020 | 2:46 PM In this May 21, 2020 file photo, a man looks at signs of a closed store due to COVID-19 in Niles, Illinois. The payroll company ADP reported Wednesday that businesses have let go of a combined 22.6 million jobs since March. (Nam Y. Huh/AP) WASHINGTON - The epic damage to America’s job market from the viral outbreak will come into sharper focus Friday when the government releases the May employment report: Eight million more jobs are estimated to have been lost. Unemployment could near 20%. And potentially fewer than half of all adults may be working. Beneath the dismal figures will be signs that job cuts, severe as they are, are slowing as more businesses gradually or partially reopen. Still, the economy is mired in a recession, and any rebound in hiring will likely be painfully slow. Economists foresee unemployment remaining in double-digits through the November elections and into 2021. Advertisement If their forecast of 8 million jobs lost in May proves correct, it would come on top of April’s loss of 20.5 million jobs — the worst monthly loss on record — and bring total job cuts in the three months since the viral outbreak intensified to nearly 30 million. That’s more than three times the jobs lost in the 2008-2009 Great Recession. And if the jobless rate does reach 20% for May, it would be double the worst level during that previous recession. Overhanging the jobs picture is widespread uncertainty about how long the unemployed will remain out of work. Most of the layoffs in recent months were a direct result of the sudden shutdowns of businesses in response to the coronavirus pandemic. As many of these businesses reopen, at least partially, workers who had been laid off have held out hope of being rehired soon. Advertisement But some small employers might not reopen at all if the recession drags on much longer. And even once companies do reopen, their business may not fully return until Americans are confident they can shop, eat out and return to other previous habits without becoming sick. For now, most people who have lost jobs still say they expect their unemployment to prove temporary. [Most read] Watch live: Former President Barack Obama holds virtual town hall to discuss policing and civil unrest that has followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis » Even if just one-third of the job losses turn out to be permanent, though, that would leave 10 million people who will need to find work at new employers or even in new occupations. That is still more than all the jobs lost in the Great Recession. A hole that size would take years to fill. Hiring will likely rebound over the summer and fall as states and cities further lift restrictions on economic activity. But it won't match the huge job cuts this spring. Oxford Economics, a consulting firm, estimates that the economy will regain 17 million jobs by year's end, a huge increase by historic standards. But that would make up for barely more than half the losses. Seth Carpenter, an economist at UBS, said that after an initial bounce-back, future hiring will likely be slow and could be interrupted by another wave of the pandemic. Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork, notes that the fastest year for job growth since the Great Recession was 3 million jobs in 2014. Even at that pace, it would take at least several years to return to the pre-pandemic job market. Since mid-March, more than 40 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits. That doesn’t mean that that many people are still unemployed. The figure likely includes some duplicate filings: In some states, self-employed and “gig” workers applied under their regular state unemployment systems before they were able to file under a new federal program that has made them eligible for benefits for the first time. [Most read] Arrest warrants issued as 4 Minneapolis cops are now charged in the death of George Floyd » In addition, some people who lost jobs early and applied for unemployment aid have been rehired. That, along with slowing layoffs, helps explain why the net job loss for May is expected to be far less than April's. Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 3 million people who were initially laid off have already been rehired. Weekly surveys of small businesses by the Census Bureau show an uptick in the number of such companies that are hiring and providing more hours of work, though the gains are slight. In mid-May, the most recent data available, nearly 10% of small companies surveyed said they had added jobs in the past week, and 12% said they had added hours. Both figures were roughly double their level three weeks earlier. Still, 16% said they had cut jobs, and a third said they were still cutting hours — figures that are consistent with ongoing but smaller job cuts in May. Three-quarters of states have allowed dining-in services to resume at restaurants, though most are still restricting total capacity. Many states have reopened gyms, hair salons and movie theaters. But a meaningful rebound will require greater public willingness to return to their old activities without fear of contracting the virus.

899,"By T.H. Lawrence | Jun 3, 2020 Former Illinois resident Art Havenhill, a Tea Party backer. | TEA Party Patriots.  Art Havenhill was born, raised and educated in Illinois. For three-quarters of a century he called the Land of Lincoln his home..  But in late 2018 Havenhill and his wife left, moving to North Carolina. Taxes, especially high property taxes, were a major reason..  He says he is disappointed the Illinois Legislature did not consider serious property tax reform during the 2020 session but he is not surprised. Havenhill, 76, said high taxes, an out-of-control pensions system and “elected incompetents” forced him and his wife and to flee Illinois, their state of birth and home for 70-plus years, in September 2018..  Havenhill was born in Chicago and grew up and went to school in Oak Lawn. He bought his first home in Park Forest, later lived in Plainfield and finally resided in Seneca before moving to North Carolina..  Havenhill said he has had several careers. He worked 11 years in credit and collections, 24 years in the automotive aftermarket, and nine years in casinos, as a dealer at a Harrah’s casino. He rose pit supervisor before transferring to slots, where he trained employees..  As seniors, the Haverhills' property tax level was locked in, he said, but by the time they left the state, they were paying around $2,800 annually for a single-level ranch home that was about 1,600 square feet and set on nine-tenths of an acre..  “For people who were not seniors, they were considerably more,” Havenhill said. “Property taxes were part of the reason we left; overall taxation fed into it much more.”.  In North Carolina they have a home with a finished basement, meaning they are taxed on 4,000 square feet. Their property tax bill is $800, less than a third of what they paid for a smaller house in Illinois..  Havenhill knows there is a steady stream of people leaving Illinois. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the state’s population fell by 168,700 people from 2010-2019. No other state saw such a large decline during a decade when the nation’s population rose by nearly 22 million.

He said a systematic change in state government is needed, but he is not optimistic..  “People have tried in the past, and they get shut down,” Havenhill said. “There’s nothing they can do. That had a lot to do with our reasoning to leave Illinois. We don’t think Illinois can survive.”.  He said Republicans were unable to accomplish much or institute real reform during their time in charge. He called them ineffective and unable to push for change..  The state’s pension system, which is deeply in debt, is a vivid example..  “It makes me and you and so many people out there responsible for taking care of their own livelihood when they retire along with the people in the pension system,” he said. “The pension system there needs to be eradicated. They need to do away with it and replace it with a 4K.”.  Havenhill admires Adam Andrzejewski, who sought the Republican nomination for governor in 2010 and is the founder and chief executive officer of OpenTheBooks.com . Havenhill said Illinois needs a complete examination of its finances..  “Believe me, the left did not want that done at all,” he said..  Havenhill was the founder and coordinator for the LaSalle County Tea Party in Ottawa and a state coordinator for TEA Party Patriots . He is still involved with the TEA Party movement in North Carolina..  While he lives in the Tar Heel State, he still cares deeply for his home state. Havenhill said he simply can’t afford to live there anymore. Want to get notified whenever we write about TEA PARTY PATRIOTS ACTION ?.

900,"Winter Weather Advisory Issued for Several Chicago-Area Counties Friday.  Census data shows most South Side communities have significantly lower life expectancies than those on the North Side. In fact, NBC 5 Investigates found that South Side residents are up to 14 times more likely to develop diabetes than those who live near Wrigley Field..  “The way we have been going about it individually is unsustainable, so we’ve decided that coming together collectively can address access to care issues,” Charles Holland of St. Bernard Hospital said. “It could really improve patient care overall on the South Side of Chicago.”.  Holland said that the new group doesn’t have a name, but they are hoping to bring back many residents who travel out of the area for hospital care. Plans include building three to six outpatient centers and a brand new modern major hospital..  “All of the hospital institutions that are part of this process are committed to the idea that nothing closes until something new is open and serving patients,” Holland said..  The new hospital group says the $1.1 billion investment will go a long way, but it will take more than a building to improve health..  “It’s not just a building that’s going to solve this problem,” Holland said. “It’s also being very involved in educating patients and helping to change patient behavior.”.  The mayor’s office said it’s looking forward to the new integrated health care system, saying all residents deserve access to quality health care services close to home..  “The agreement announced today is an innovative proposal to ensure Chicago’s South Side residents have access to quality and accessible healthcare services,” the mayor’s office said in a statement..  The new hospital system plans to announce a name and its leaders later this year. Funding for the project will come from private and public sources.

Illinois Unemployment Rate Drops to New Historical Low in December.  SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) announced today that the unemployment rate fell -0.1 percentage point to 3.7 percent, a new historical low, while nonfarm payrolls added +8,000 jobs in December, based on preliminary data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and released by IDES. The November monthly change in payrolls was revised from the preliminary report from -17,200 to -13,400 jobs..  The state’s unemployment rate is +0.2 percentage points higher than the national unemployment rate reported for December 2019, which was 3.5 percent, unchanged from the previous month. The Illinois unemployment rate was down -0.6 percentage point from a year ago when it was 4.3 percent..  Illinois payroll employment has shown variability since the beginning of the year, as have national payrolls. Average payroll employment in Illinois during the October to December three-month period, which provides a more stable measure of payroll employment change, was up +900 jobs, compared to the September to November three-month period. The largest average gains were found in Educational and Health Services (+2,900), Leisure and Hospitality (+1,900) and Government (+1,700)..  “Over the past year, Governor Pritzker has worked hard to improve Illinois’ economy and create the conditions for good jobs around the state that will build long-term economic success,” said Deputy Governor Dan Hynes. “From the bipartisan balanced budget and historic Rebuild Illinois infrastructure plan to lifting up workers and families by raising the minimum wage, this administration is creating an economy that works for everyone.” “Governor Pritzker has implemented a number of policies and strategies that continue to address the needs of the diverse Illinois workforce,” said Erin Guthrie, Acting Director of the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. “The Five-Year Economic and Rebuild Illinois Plans, coupled with the minimum wage increase, are steps that will help create a symbiotic environment in which businesses and workers can thrive.”.  Compared to a year ago, nonfarm payroll employment increased by +45,000 jobs with the largest gains in: Educational and Health Services (+17,100), Leisure and Hospitality (+16,900), and Government (+13,400). The industry sectors with the largest over-the-year declines were: Trade, Transportation and Utilities (-4,600), Manufacturing (-1,900) and Construction (-1,200). Illinois nonfarm payrolls were up +0.7 percent over-the-year as compared to the nation’s +1.4 percent over-the-year gain in December..  The number of unemployed workers decreased from the prior month, -2.4 percent to 240,100, a new record low, and was down -13.2 percent over the same month for the prior year. The labor force was down -0.3 percent over-the-month but up +0.1 percent over-the-year. The unemployment rate identifies those individuals who are out of work and seeking employment..  An individual who exhausts or is ineligible for benefits is still reflected in the unemployment rate if they actively seek work. IDES maintains the state’s largest job search engine, Illinois Job Link (IJL), to help connect jobseekers to employers who are hiring, which recently showed 60,792 posted resumes with 90,561 jobs available..  2014-2018 seasonally adjusted labor force data for Illinois, and all other states, have been revised as required by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The monthly historical revisions to state labor force estimates reflect new national benchmark controls, state working-age population controls, seasonal factors, as well as updated total nonfarm jobs and unemployment benefits claims inputs. Illinois labor force data were also smoothed to eliminate large monthly changes as a result of volatility in the monthly Census Population Survey (CPS) and national benchmarking. For these reasons, the comments and tables citing unemployment rates in previous news releases/materials may no longer be valid. Monthly seasonally adjusted unemployment rates for Illinois and the Chicago-Naperville-Arlington Heights Metropolitan Division are available here . Monthly 1990-2018 seasonally adjusted nonfarm payroll employment data for Illinois have been revised. To control for potential survey error, the estimates are benchmarked annually to universal counts derived primarily from unemployment insurance tax reports.

903,"State policymakers are looking at ways to help stem Illinois’ population loss. U.S. Census data shows Illinois led the nation in the past decade in terms of population decline, losing nearly 160,000 in just six years. Treasurer Michael Frerichs understands people want security and a plan to stabilize the state’s finances moving forward. “In the Treasurer’s office we’re looking for ways to grow our economy, to create opportunities,” Frerichs said. “If people have good jobs here, they want to stay. It’s clear that we have high property taxes and we should do something about that, but people should also be aware that Illinois has had population decline and we’ve lost congressman ever since the 1920s.” Because of Illinois population decline, demographers have projected the state will lose at least one seat in Congress in the next reapportionment after the 2020 Census. Frerichs said the state’s cold winters don’t help make Illinois a more attractive destination. State Sen. Neil Anderson, R-Andalusia, said it was clear that Illinois policies have hindered job growth. As for his Democratic colleagues, he said: “behind closed doors a lot of them understand it, but other places I think they just bury their heads in the sand and hope that it all goes away.” “It’s not going away,” Anderson said. “The only thing that’s going away is people.“ Comptroller Susana Mendoza said taxes aren’t the only issue. “So there’s a lot that we can do,” Mendoza said. “I don’t think it’s all about taxes. I think the quality of life and the ability to have good schools and give people who are graduating from our colleges an incentive to stay in Illinois with good-paying jobs. Those are all part of the equation. It’s not like one thing will solve this issue.” State Sen.

906,"From the Lisa Sims, News from State Senator Chuck Weaver Non-citizens ‘accidentally’ registered to vote According to media reports, more than 500 people who are not citizens and are not legally eligible to vote in elections, were registered to vote through the state’s Automatic Voter Registration (AVR) system, which was signed into law in 2017. The AVR system automatically registers voters when they apply for a driver’s license or state ID card, unless the individual opts out of the process. Between July 2, 2018, and Dec. 13, 2019, the registration information of 574 people was “improperly forwarded” to the Illinois State Board of Elections, according to a Dec. 18, 2019, letter from the Illinois Secretary of State’s office to the State Board of Elections. The 574 individuals had all checked a “no” box on a question asking if they were U.S. citizens. According to the Secretary of State’s office, the issue was due to a “programming error” involved with the registration process. The Illinois State Board of Elections has notified the local election authorities where the individuals reside, and has sent letters to the individuals themselves. Of the improperly registered voters, 126 live in Chicago, 135 in other parts of Cook County, 56 in DuPage County, 54 in Lake County, 1 in Christian County, and 1 in Sangamon County. On. Jan. 21, all Republican Senators sent a letter to the Secretary of State’s office seeking further information about the issue. The request included information on which locations erroneously registered voters, what investigatory steps would be taken and what would be done to prevent situations like this in the future. “It is imperative the residents of Illinois know their elections are being managed and conducted in a lawful manner, and ensuring our laws are being implemented correctly is a practical matter, not a partisan one,” the letter stated. Since being signed into law in August 2017, the Illinois AVR system has so far registered more than 600,000 individuals to vote. Legislative process begins anew The spring legislative session begins Jan. 28, and State Senators and Representatives are currently finalizing their legislative agendas and filing their proposals in legislative form so their ideas can be considered in the coming months. In the Senate, the deadline for the introduction of substantive bills, which deal with new laws and changes to existing laws, is Feb. 14. Those bills then have until March 27 to be heard in committees, and until April 24 to be called for a vote in the Senate. After that, the Senate considers legislation that has passed the House of Representatives, and appropriations or spending bills that will form the state’s budget. The session is scheduled to adjourn on May 31. Push for Fair Maps continues As a new legislative session begins, Senate Republicans are again calling for action to fix the current partisan practice of drawing gerrymandered maps. Every 10 years, the state is required to reapportion legislative and Congressional districts to match the results of the most recent census. Illinois currently has a “winner take all” system where one party has the complete power to draw the maps, which typically leads to confusing and strangely shaped or “gerrymandered” districts. They note that the maps are typically drawn not to best represent the people of Illinois and their communities, but to offer the party in power the best chance at electoral success. The process has often been called out for allowing politicians to pick their districts, instead of the people choosing their representatives. Numerous attempts throughout the years to fix the system have been blocked by legislative leaders and lawsuits. Still, the General Assembly does have the power to put the question of whether to fix the current system on the ballot for voters to decide. The concept of Fair Maps has broad bipartisan support among rank-and-file lawmakers, Gov. J.B. Pritzker has expressed his support for the idea, and former President Barack Obama made the issue a key component of his speech to the General Assembly in 2016. New law eliminates license suspension for non-payment of fines Individuals who fail to pay tickets for most non-moving violations will no longer face the loss of their driver’s license. The “License to Work Act” removes the penalty of suspension for a number of offenses, including parking tickets and tollway violations. Previously, the state suspended more than 50,000 licenses per year for failure to pay tickets, fines, and fees. Supporters of the new law hope that it will enable people to continue working and earning money to pay the fines and fees. At the same time, opponents fear it will make it easier to ignore fines and fees, and by extension, the laws that result in those fines and fees. January is Blood Donor Month Because blood donations often drop off right after the holidays, January has been recognized as Blood Donor Awareness Month since 1970, to raise awareness of the need for blood and platelet donations during the winter months. The American Red Cross is reminding people of the importance of donating blood. In the United States, someone needs blood every two seconds, and nearly 21 million blood components are transfused every year. Despite medical and technological advances, blood cannot be manufactured, so donations are the only way to get blood to those in need. The organization also notes that one donation can save three lives. According to the Red Cross, while 38 percent of the population is eligible to donate blood at any given time, typically only about 10 percent actually do.","[0.5005121231079102, 0.4994879364967346]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5005121231079102

Unlike most jobs numbers, it is based not on surveys and estimates but on an actual hard count of private-sector jobs covered by unemployment insurance that is considered highly reliable..

That's not even a tenth of a percent, and far and away is the lowest annual rise since the city and state began recovering from the subprime mortgage recession a decade ago..  The numbers are preliminary but in past years have changed little after initial publication..  The report found weakness in every corner of the metropolitan area, including downtown Chicago, which had been growing faster than the nation as a whole but now has fallen behind..  Job growth in the central area—defined by the report as the Loop (Central Business District) and outer business ring—was just 7,000 year to year.

The question is whether that trend reversed and went back at least to the January level in the second quarter of the year..  Still, even a gain of 25,000 year to year would be an annual increase of just 0.7 percent at a time when the national job growth rate, after a pending recalibration, is likely to be twice that..

Others, however, say the tiny growth is all too consistent with what they’ve been seeing..  “Metropolitan Chicago is experiencing prolonged slow growth,” said Austen Edwards, senior policy analyst at the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. “Since 2001, the region’s annual job growth has been approximately one-third the national average. While the region continues to expand employment slightly, national trends are interacting with regional issues to constrain economic growth.”.  Ergo, Edwards added, while the March figures may have been a little on the dour side, they generally are in line with the city’s long-term trajectory..  The ultra-slow-growth data also is consistent with U.S. Census Bureau estimates that metro Chicago has lost population in recent years—perhaps because job opportunities are better in other cities..

According to the United States Census Bureau, 84% of the people in Chicago lived in their current houses for at least one year. Consequently, the housing market in Chicago is also booming, even with its modest prices. It’s a trend that will continue for the coming years..  If you have a home in Chicago, you need to maintain it well for you and your family’s physical and mental well-being. The problem is, not all may have the time to clean their house.

You can also utilize the professional services of maids in Chicago so you can spend quality time with people who matter the most..  Thus, all you need to do is secure the right service. With that, here are four questions you should ask before choosing who to hire for the house cleaning services. Photo by The Creative Exchange on Unsplash Does the Cleaning Service Have Business Permits and Licenses?.  First, you want to hire a maid service that is legally operating. It might be common sense, but some people get cleaning services from just anyone..  Operating a cleaning service in Chicago has specific standards to uphold. You need to check if they have permits and licenses to give the best service possible..  Remember, these are people you do not know entering your house. Besides, you do not want to get scammed or have something stolen from you. So, it’s better to be safe than have a crisis later. Did the Cleaning Maids Have Background Check?.  Now that you found a legal maid cleaning service, you need to review if they do background checks for their personnel. Since you want to maintain the safety of your family, make sure that the person entering your home has no criminal record..  Reputable house cleaning services based in Chicago conduct rigorous background checks to ensure your security. Photo by The Creative Exchange on Unsplash What are the Rates for the Service?.  There are different rates for different cleaning services. Be sure to get the best price for your needs..  On average, a cleaning service in Chicago roughly charges $100-$130 for cleaning a one-bedroom and bathroom apartment. But this might differ based on the package you get and the size of your home..  Some companies give out discounts for recurring weekly and monthly services. They can also have additional cleaning services for refrigerators, cabinets, and many more..  Therefore, be as specific as possible. When you find your maid service in Chicago, bear in mind to inquire about the fees on the exact parts of your home that the personnel will clean. What Equipment and Supplies Are They Using? Are You Okay with Them Using That in Your House?.  Another essential question to ask is the equipment they are utilizing. Will they bring their vacuum cleaner and mop? If yes, are you okay that they have used that for other houses? Photo by Andy Fitzsimon on Unsplash.  You do not know what kind of dirt the equipment got from their previous client. What if there are dog or cat hair and one of the people in your house is allergic?.  Are they using safe and green cleaning supplies? Is the chemical content safe for your furniture and fixtures?.  If you find any equipment or supplies you do not want them to use, you can opt to lend your equipment instead. In this way, you know that you are safe and secured..  Employing the right cleaning service provider in Chicago is not that easy. But if you know what questions to ask, you can get the best maid cleaning service for your needs.","[0.513540506362915, 0.48645955324172974]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.513540506362915

When you look statewide from 2010-2018, the Latino population is increasing at a faster rate of 9%.Congressman Garcia said Latinos must ""overcome fear and confusion"" about census 2020, referring to the battle that killed a question about citizenship.""The citizenship question is no longer there,"" said Oswaldo Alvarez, Illinois' Statewide Census Director.

920,"Getty Images.  More Instagram-worthy spots like this, please..  Metropolitan Chicago continues to get smaller, at least compared to other big American cities. But it also continues to get relatively richer..  That’s the conclusion in the Brookings Institution's annual look at how American cities are doing..  According to the data, over the decade that ended in 2018, the three-state Chicago metropolitan region ranked 42nd in overall growth among the top 53 U.S. metropolitan areas, with the number of new jobs and gross metropolitan product no better than 40th. That's not very good..  But when it comes to what Brookings dubs “prosperity”—a standard that includes the cost of living, change in the annual wage and change in productivity—we’re solidly in the middle, at 25th. And when it comes to sharing the wealth among racial groups, or “inclusion,” the region is making up ground with other metros, ranking 7th of the 53 and 4th when it comes to the poverty rate, which actually decreased 2.5 percentage points over that decade..  Those trends were accentuated in just the past year, 2017-18. In that period, metro Chicago ranked 45th in growth, 9th in prosperity and 8th in inclusion..  So what’s up?.  The data suggest to me the region is losing relatively low-income jobs and population but gaining on the higher end of both. That’s consistent with a shift from manufacturing and lower-end positions to a so-called knowledge economy, and consistent with other recent reports that the city is losing lots of black residents but college graduate rates are rising quickly among those who remain..  Brookings’ Alan Berube, the chief author of the report, says population changes indeed may be part of the explanation, but he believes other factors may be at least as significant..  For instance, “There were broader recovery trends in the Chicago regional economy over this period (including a rising share of adults in employment) that contributed to its better-than-average performance on economic inclusion,” Berube said. “And to the more basic question, Chicago as a region had about the same population in 2018 as in 2008 (9.5 million), with 4 percent more jobs, and 12 percent more regional output.”.  Definitely something to chew over, but no simple explanations at this point. Maybe better answers will come from the about-to-begin decennial census. Letter to the Editor.

924,"Personal income growth in Illinois is lagging behind the rest of the country..  A new report released by Pew Charitable Trusts found that the state’s income growth was 49th in the nation over the past decade, at an annualized rate of 1.1 percent. Illinois remained in the bottom ten for the first half of 2019, with a growth rate of 2 percent..  “The data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis that we use to track state personal income shows us that since the recession began, and over the past year, drops in farm earnings contributed the most to the slow growth in total personal income in Illinois,” said Joanna Biernacka-Lievestro an officer at The Pew Charitable Trusts..  The report pointed to low commodity prices, adverse weather conditions, international trade disputes and decreased assistant payments in the second quarter of 2019 to farmers..  The report also found that rapid population growth was typically associated with a strong labor force and economic expansion. Biernacka-Lievestro said a shrinking or slow-growing population can be both a cause and effect of weakened economic prospects..  “Illinois was one of only two states that actually lost population between 2008 and 2018,” Biernacka-Lievestro said. “Illinois lost about 6,000 residents over the decade, which may not sound like a lot, but translates into a negative, even though small, annual growth rate, which makes Illinois the second slowest-growing state over the 10 years. What may be even more revealing is the trend line. Illinois population stopped growing in 2013 and has fallen for five straight years.”.  Personal income sums up all the money and benefits that residents receive from work, certain investments and other sources such as government benefits. It is one way to track a state’s economic trends..  Over the past year, western states largely led the way when it came to personal income growth, with Washington, Utah, and Arizona topping the list..  “The longest recovery on the record has played out unevenly across states as the pace of growth since the recession differs across the country,” Biernacka-Lievestro said. “But over the past year, growth was widespread with all fifty states recording gains in personal income. Even though growth has been slower in the Midwestern states over the past decade, it is important to remember that all states recorded gains since the second quarter of last year.”.  North Dakota and Utah tied for the strongest annualized growth since the start of the recession.

930,"Senate Democrats backing marijuana decriminalization in response to legalization in Illinois, Michigan Dan Carden dan.carden@nwi.com, 219-933-3357.  Senate Democratic Leader Tim Lanane, D-Anderson Dan Carden, The Times Save.  Northwest Indiana next year will be bordered by two states, Illinois and Michigan, where recreational marijuana is legal for adults to use..  That almost certainly means many more people traveling through or visiting the Region will be arrested for marijuana possession, clogging up county jails and courts with nonviolent offenders nabbed for having a drug that's acceptable to consume in their home state..  Democrats in the Indiana Senate last week said they believe that's a huge waste of Hoosier taxpayer dollars..  So they plan to file legislation, when the General Assembly convenes in January, to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana..  ""For simple possession of minor amounts of marijuana you will not go to jail,"" said Senate Democratic Leader Tim Lanane, D-Anderson..  ""You will still be held accountable within the judicial system, but it will become an infraction and not a misdemeanor as it currently is."".  Lanane said under the Democrats' proposal, set to be sponsored by state Sen. Karen Tallian, D-Ogden Dunes, the process of being stopped by police for marijuana possession would be similar to getting a speeding ticket, rather than the potentially life-altering ordeal it now is..  ""When those folks are arrested they're taken somewhere and it's the county jail. And they stay there, some of them, far too long, because they simply can't make bond,"" Lanane said..  ""So it's all part of this process of bond reform and jail overcrowding that we need to look at."".  According to Lanane, possession of marijuana is the second-highest incident for arrest in Indiana, and having even small amounts of the drug can result in up to 18 months behind bars..  ""We're not saying it should be legalized. We're saying possession of small amounts should be decriminalized,"" Lanane said..  The Republican-controlled Legislature repeatedly has refused to act on prior Democratic proposals to either decriminalize or legalize marijuana in Indiana, based on the theory that a person using marijuana eventually will turn to more dangerous and addictive drugs..  However, with legal marijuana available in states adjacent to 15 of Indiana's 92 counties, many county leaders, including Lake County Council President Ted Bilski, D-Hobart, are asking for decriminalization simply to avoid overburdening law enforcement..  Lanane said they're telling him: ""Stop clogging up our jails, stop clogging up our judicial system by putting people in jail for possession of small amounts of marijuana."".  Besides marijuana decriminalization, Senate Democrats plan to focus during the 10-week legislative session on proposals to reform Indiana's redistricting process and to require the safe storage and sale of firearms..  On redistricting, Lanane said the drawing of new legislative district boundaries following the 2020 U.S. Census ought to be done by a nonpartisan citizens commission, instead of by the state lawmakers who have the most to gain from favorable lines..  ""We believe that it's time to finally end the process of manipulating state voting maps in favor of a particular political party,"" Lanane said. ""I don't think there's any doubt that's what occurred in the last go-around in terms of redistricting in the state of Indiana."".  State Sen. David Niezgodski, D-South Bend, agreed. He said, ""The voter should have the right to choose their elected officials. The elected officials shouldn't be the ones choosing their voters."".  On guns, Lanane said Senate Democrats are calling for all private gun sales to be processed through a federally licensed dealer to ensure a background check is completed before the transaction is finalized..  Likewise, Democrats want gun owners with children in their homes to be required to lock up their weapons, or consistently use trigger locks, to ensure children aren't able to access guns or shoot them if they do..  ""Research shows that kids that get the weapons, that are committing some of these mass shootings at schools, get them from their homes. Even responsible gun owners want to see this measure because obviously if something happens that looks bad on them,"" said state Sen. J.D.

Sam Yingling, D-Grayslake, is still encouraging everyone to fill out the 2020 census questionnaire..  “Accurate census data is crucial to making sure that our community is maximizing the amount of resources we receive,” said Yingling. “I encourage all members of the community to take a few minutes to fill out the census and be counted.”.  The census can be filled out online, by phone, or by mail, and is required to be filled out by law. The data gathered from the census plays a critical role in determining how the federal government allocates billions of dollars to schools, roads, hospitals, and more. The census does not ask any questions regarding citizenship. Yingling wants to ensure that people do not forget about the importance of the census due to the large focus on the pandemic..  “With the pandemic we are currently going through, we need as many federal dollars as we can get,” said Yingling. “Filling out the census is a quick, easy way to help support the critical infrastructure in our community that keeps us safe during hard times like these.”.

After officers reported that people were continuing to defy the rules, the mayor said he had directed the city's police department to use its discretion in issuing citations and arrests..  ""These are very serious times and I'm begging you to please stay at home,"" Brant Walker, mayor of Alton, Illinois, said in a briefing on Friday. Less than 48 hours later, police broke up a gathering at Hiram's Tavern in downtown Alton. Among those in attendance: Walker's wife. Walker announced in a statement on Monday that police had investigated and stopped a social gathering in violation of Illinois' statewide order around 1 a.m. on Sunday. He said police also informed him that his wife was there.

Here's what that means for you Illinois' stay at home order prohibits all public and private gatherings of any number of people outside a single household or living unit. The Alton Police Department said in a press release it had received several complaints that the tavern was continuing to operate on weekends. Officers found no unauthorized activity until Sunday when ""several individuals were located inside Hiram's Tavern in an area outside public view, clearly disregarding the executive order and public pleas for compliance,"" according to the release. Alton police confirmed to CNN that officers issued a criminal complaint for reckless conduct -- a class A misdemeanor charge punishable by up to 364 days in jail and/or a fine of $2,500 -- to everyone who had gathered at the bar. The mayor said in his statement that he was embarrassed by his wife's actions. ""My wife is an adult capable of making her own decisions, and in this instance she exhibited a stunning lack of judgement,"" Walker said. ""She now faces the same consequences for her ill-advised decision as the other individuals who chose to violate the 'Stay At Home' order during this incident."" ""I am embarrassed by this incident and apologize to the citizens of Alton for any embarrassment this incident may cause our City,"" he added.

937,"Census estimates nearly half of Illinois has responded voluntarily Posted on April 7, 2020 Census officials say Illinois is ahead of the national average in terms of responding to the U.S. Census. (Photo courtesy: United States Census/Facebook).  By Illinois Radio Network.  SPRINGFIELD – Illinois is ahead of the national average in terms of responding to the U.S. Census, according to federal officials. In total, 66,700,000 residents have responded to the U.S. Census, the nation’s decennial headcount initiated by the Constitution. By March 30, just under 40 percent of Illinois households had responded to the U.S. Census. As of April 5 , Illinois had surged to just under 50 percent, a lower rate than only seven other states. “We are optimistic in Illinois that we will be getting an accurate count,” said Tim Olson, associate director for field operations for the U.S. Census. The response rate is because of the availability of filling out the Census online. “Every additional household that responds online or over the phone, or with a paper form is one less household that the Census Bureau needs to send someone to get the information,” he said. Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Virginia have the highest response rates at just over 50 percent. Trout Valley, a small village of just over 500 in McHenry County, has the third-highest response rate in America, at 78.1%.

And according to the public health commissioner, 52% of those testing positive are black..  Health disparities and access to care play a key role. Many essential workers holding down jobs like driving buses, childcare or in grocery stores are black. As the pandemic continues to take a toll on health and economics, there are calls for addressing underlying racial inequities..  Linda Rae Murray, a retired doctor who teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago's School of Public Health, said the high mortality rate for blacks doesn't surprise her..  ""It makes me furious. It makes me angry. The pandemic hits different populations differently,"" Murray said. ""For African-Americans we have higher rates of diabetes, higher rates of blood pressure, coronary diseases and many other medical conditions that make people more vulnerable to having bad outcomes to this virus."".

""This is a call to action moment for all of us. When we talk about equity and inclusion, they're not just nice notions. They're an imperative that we must embrace as a city,"" Lightfoot said..  The mayor's office created a new racial equity rapid response team. The idea is to work with community leaders to create a system of checking in on people and then direct resources to vulnerable communities..

""And that when communities were impacted, whether natural or human emergencies, can we use the work that we're doing in emergency response to actually build a bridge to longer term so we are building greater resiliency."".

942,"https://ift.tt/2ztRZ2l.  Illinois will become the first state to provide Medicaid for undocumented seniors not only because of what state Rep. Delia Ramirez has heard from her constituents, but because of her own family’s experience..  Tucked in near the end of the 465-page budget implementation bill that passed the Illinois General Assembly late Saturday night was a provision giving Medicaid access to noncitizens over 65 years old and whose income is $12,670 or less, which is at or under the federal poverty level..  Gov. JB Pritzker said he will approve next year’s budget and its implementations. Medicaid services for qualified undocumented seniors will kick in July 1 when the 2021 budget year begins..  The expansion was a big win for the Legislative Latino Caucus, which Ramirez took lead on the effort through the health and human services working group leading up to the special session. She said the coverage will save the state money in the long run, costing about $2 million, which in her opinion, “is nothing to a $2 billion Medicaid bill.”.  She said it’s about three times cheaper to cover undocumented seniors than it is to not cover them and then “have them in a hospital when they’re already dying and are in stage three of cancer and other things because they didn’t show up until they tested positive with coronavirus and then all these other things they had also came to light and became too late to prevent.”.  One of the leading motivators for Ramirez was her mother, who is now a U.S. citizen. She was a homecare worker with diabetes who stopped working on March 24 because she and the 89-year-old person she was taking care of decided it’d be safer for her to stop visiting amid the pandemic..  When the Chicago Democrat asked her mother why she stopped paying for insurance after joining unemployment, her mother explained that they simply couldn’t afford it. Ramirez’s father retired without pension benefits and brings in just enough money to cover his medications and all other bills..  “‘I can’t pay out of pocket $500 a month (for insurance),’” Ramirez said what her mother told her. “‘So until I go back to work, I have no insurance and I’m going to pray that I stay as healthy as possible and not go anywhere, so that I’m not in a position where I have to end up in a hospital with a bill we can’t afford.’”.  Ramirez had a similar bill last year that failed to reach a vote on the House floor, but she said the COVID-19 pandemic has shined a light on the need for expanded health care coverage..  She represents one of the hardest-hit districts from the pandemic, which primarily includes the Humboldt Park neighborhood in Chicago. The positivity rate for the virus in Ramirez’s district reached nearly 50%, she said. The COVID-19 death rate in Illinois for Latinos is about 19% while Latinos make up about 17% of the state’s population, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health and U.S. Census Bureau 2019 estimates..  Additionally, she noted that about 250,000 families in the state didn’t receive an economic stimulus check because they were either mixed status families or undocumented..  “You could imagine the financial hardship,” Ramirez said. “No access to health care, no access to unemployment insurance, living in multi-generational homes, no place to isolate. All of this equates to a higher risk of people not just testing positive, but literally dying.”.  She said there was some opposition to her bill last year from lawmakers saying “we should only be focusing on citizens,” or asking how the state will pay for it. But during this year’s special session, she didn’t hear any opposition..  “Just this piece right here for a group of people who have been told that no resources — you can pay taxes, you can do this, you can do that, you can be in this country for 25 years attempting to legalize, but you can’t get this basic health care, basic ability to stay alive, covered. If ever before, this pandemic has shown us how critical that is,” Ramirez said..  She also highlighted health care as a human right, undocumented or not, and that COVID-19 “has shown the way public health binds us all together and that denying health care to someone is hurting all of us.”.  ASI Home Care is one company that will benefit from the measure. Although based in Chicago, patients can be from anywhere in the state as ASI Home Care offers a variety of telehealth and remote monitoring services..  Marta Cerda, its CEO, said ASI Home Care is one of the few, if not only, Latino-led agencies in the state providing various home care services in English and Spanish..  “When COVID hit, one of my biggest moments of upset or despair was that I wanted to take care of undocumented elderly and we really couldn’t do that under the circumstances we were under. Our programs don’t allow for that,” Cerda said. “So, because of the passage of this provision, they will be able to access Medicaid and they will be able to enter into our program, so we’ll be able to take care of them.”.  The General Assembly won’t return to Springfield until the veto session on Nov. 17 as Ramirez said there is more to be done, pointing to people who may make $100 too much to qualify for the expanded services and still can’t afford health care..  “When I think about my mother and father who have been here for 37 years, there’s significantly far more to be done,” Ramirez said, “so that people are not put in a position that they have to choose between their property taxes and their medication.”.

943,"This Illinois community will use recreational marijuana sales tax proceeds to fund local reparations program Genevieve Bookwalter Pioneer Press Save.  CHICAGO — Evanston aldermen on Monday approved directing all sales tax revenue collected from recreational marijuana purchases to a fund that will establish a local reparations program..  Officials say the program will help the city’s black population stay in Evanston while also providing training for jobs and other benefits..  “We can implement funding to directly invest in black Evanston,” said Ald. Robin Rue Simmons, 5th Ward, who proposed the reparations bill..  While Evanston officials have voted to permit, tax and appropriate money from recreational marijuana sales, many other suburbs have voted not to allow recreational marijuana dispensaries to open when the businesses become legal next year under state law..  Evanston leaders say they see the dispensaries as an opportunity to pay for a local reparations program that would address the lingering institutional effects of slavery and discrimination. The proposal passed 8-1, with Ald. Tom Suffredin, 6th Ward, voting against it..  Simmons said the source of the money was especially appropriate, as many black residents were victims of the “war on drugs” and spent time in jail for smoking marijuana, a substance that in specific quantities will now be permitted in Illinois..  The tax on marijuana will “be invested in the community it unfairly policed and damaged,” Simmons said..  A committee of residents is currently examining ways to spend the money and how to best support the black community through housing, education and economic incentives. The fund will be capped at $10 million, according to city of Evanston staff reports. City estimates project the marijuana tax could generate $500,000 to $750,000 per year..  “This is a really special moment in the city of Evanston and also in the country,” said Ald. Peter Braithwaite, 2nd Ward..  Community members attending the meeting praised the effort and thanked the council for investing in residents who were harmed by discriminatory housing and other past policies..  “I support the approval of the ordinance for the city of Evanston to commit all of the anticipated tax revenue from the recreational marijuana businesses, to support work aimed at intentionally repairing harms done to the black community from policies and practices in so many different areas,” said Oliver Ruff, a retired teacher and Evanston resident..  Simmons’ proposal came as Evanston’s black population decreased from 22.5% of the population in 2000 to 16.9% in 2017, according to U.S. Census data..  The idea that the United States should make reparations to the descendants of slaves has been part of the national conversation since the slave trade ended, but there has been little formal action and much debate. Questions include what form reparations should take, and what institutions or individuals should make them..  Frustrated by the lack of action at the national level, Rue Simmons has said she believed a local reparations program could gain traction quickly and have a more immediate impact..

947,"Jul 15, 2020 at 1:23 PM Chicago’s Dreadhead Cowboy has taken on a new cause. Already a horseback-riding sensation at Chicago-area Black Lives Matters protests, where he’s braved tear gas and befriended police, and a favorite in majority Black neighborhoods, where he rides to promote his dream of a stable in the central city, the cowboy recently got a pitch from the office of Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Advertisement “They basically said, ‘We’re on the same team, so why not help each other?‘” he said. So starting this week, the Dreadhead Cowboy, otherwise known as Adam Hollingsworth, is riding with a green and black Census 2020 flag, a Census 2020 mask and a message for Chicagoans: If you want better funding for your schools and your community, if you want to have your voice heard, take a few minutes and fill out your census survey. Advertisement Hollingsworth, 33, a former boxer and exotic dancer, said he filled out the census survey for the first time this year, and it only took him a few minutes.

People stop to pet Unity the horse as the Dreadhead Cowboy, aka Adam Hollingsworth, rides him down West Madison Street on June 25, 2020, in the East Garfield Park neighborhood of Chicago. (Erin Hooley/Chicago Tribune) During a visit to Garfield Park on Tuesday, he said that many people already know of his new mission. “They’re basically telling me as soon as they see me: ‘We did our census. You ain’t gotta worry about it,‘” he said with a chuckle. People take photos of him and his horse, he said, and as usual, he pauses to give kids a chance to ride. Hollingsworth keeps his horses in the south suburbs and trucks them into Chicago for rides through city streets. Fans have compared him to Batman and lauded him for a June peacekeeping trip into the Latino Little Village neighborhood to defuse tensions over fears of looting by Black protesters. The cowboy got a very warm reception from Little Village. The mayor’s office confirmed the arrangement with Hollingsworth, with a spokesperson saying via email that Hollingsworth will be visiting neighborhoods where he is a trusted voice, including East and West Garfield Park, Washington Park, Woodlawn, Englewood, West Englewood, Greater Grand Crossing, North and South Lawndale, and Back of the Yards.

948,"U.S. Census stresses importance of including Arab Americans and Muslims in the 2020 Census count during event at DuSable Museum of African American History on Wednesday. The Census has hired several Arab Americans to assist from Chicago and is receiving support from the influential American Arab Chamber of Commerce By Ray Hanania.  Illinois representatives of the U.S. Census said Wednesday that engaging Arab Americans in the 2020 Census is a priority that will benefit their community as well as reinforce their needs in everyday society..  Ellisa Johnson, the deputy regional census manager for the Chicago Region of the U.S. Census Bureau, spoke directly about the need for Arab Americans and people of the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) to complete the 2020 Census forms..  Johnson was one of the many officials who participated in a program to rally support for the Census held at the DuSable Museum of African American History in Chicago on East 57th Street..  Delivered by FeedBurner.  Partnership Census Specialist Amjad T. Assi, deputy regional census manager for the Chicago Region Ellisa Johnson, and American Arab Chamber of Commerce President Hasan Nijem.

We want to make sure we have a diverse workforce, that is why we have the staff we do that speaks up to 21 different languages,” Johnson said noting the Census impacts how much federal funding is allocated to support communities over the next 10 years, which is estimated at more than $675 billion a year across the country..  “That is vitally important to us to make sure we have fair representation that represents every single population here in the State of Illinois and particularly in the City of Chicago. In some areas, we have over 124 different languages and we wanted to make sure we have a work force that looks that way and that can reach those populations when it comes time to knock on doors and encourage people to responds to the census.”.  The DuSable Museum event was held in the “Sunken Gardens outdoors, maintaining strict social distancing and the wearing of face masks to protect attendees from COVID-19 infection..  “The census impacts all of us no matter what your race is. We want everyone to feel included in the Census because it is all about everyone. It’s not just about one group,” Johnson added..  “It is vitally important for the MENA Community and all of our diverse communities in the State of Illinois to make sure everyone is counted. It impacts all of us.” Partnership Census Specialist Amjad T. Assi and American Arab Chamber of Commerce President Hasan Nijem. Photo courtesy of Ray Hanania.  The State has allocated more than $20 million that has been distributed to many ethnic American and racial organizations in Illinois, although many Arab Americans have called for more funds to be allocated directly to the Arab American community..  Wednesday’s program at the DuSable Museum included among the audience several prominent Arab American leaders including Hasan Nijem who is the president of the American Arab Chamber of Commerce, as well as Reema Kamran, executive director of the Islamic Muslim Civic Coalition..  “We are very proud that the U.S. Census has reached out to the Arab American and Muslim community to hire individuals from our community to work on their staff to ensure that we are included and fully represented,” Nijem said..  The American Arab Chamber of Commerce has been very active in recent months defending the rights of Hookah Lounge owners and also a dozen Arab American businesses that were looted and burned down during the post-George Floyd protests in Chicago alone..  “If we are not engaged and involved actively, sometimes we don’t get noticed and we are not given the extensive role that we deserve. Arab Americans are very active in the Chicagoland area as business people, politicians, government officials, activists with many organizations and also veterans and family members,” Nijem added..  “The Census must reach out to us and include us in order to fulfill their mission fully and properly. But we also have to reach out to them and participate and show support so they can see who we are. Sometimes our community focuses too much on politics and the Middle East and not enough about our needs and lives right here in America. There is a balance we need to strike.”.  Nijem noted that several Arab Americans have been hired by the Census to fill this void. Among those at the DuSable event was Dr. Amjad T. Assi, a partnership specialist at the U.S. Census Bureau hired to engage Arab and Muslim Americans as well as in higher education in the Chicago Region..  Also attending and speaking was Shamiram William Youkhanna, an Assyrian American member of the U.S. Census bureau. The Assyrian community is an important Arabic-speaking Christian community that originates from the Arab World and which has a large population presence in Chicago..

949,"Barry Richard Getty Images.  Mayor Trainwreck has finally figured out what bloodstained Chicago needs to get its mind off of the carnage of children and young adults: it's Census Cowboy to the rescue..  Donning a bright green cowboy hat, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced that Census Cowboy would be riding into troubled neighborhoods where compliance with the federal census is less than 30 percent to encourage folks to fill out and return their census forms. After all, the census is different from voting in that you have to be alive to matter..  Adam Hollingsworth, known widely in Chicago as the Dreadhead Cowboy, is a horse breeder who provides riding lessons to inner-city kids. The Daily Wire describes Hollingsworth as ""something of a goodwill ambassador to the city government"" who has appeared in recent marches and protests..  Mayor Lightfoot confesses to being a fan of the 1960's Batman television series and calls Census Cowboy a ""superhero."" In urging Chicagoans to participate in the federal census, Lightfoot took a dig at President Trump, suggesting he might ""enjoy seeing a major drop in population, particularly in minority communities."".  At a time when Chicago is experiencing a tremendous spike in gun violence that has left several children, including a 20-month-old dead, Mayor Lightfoot might want to focus on keeping residents alive..  Instead of Census Cowboy, perhaps Mayor Lightfoot should summon ICE Cowboy and FBI Cowboy to help to clean up the streets while there are still enough people to count for the census..  The Trump Administration has offered countless times to assist Chicago and America's other once-great cities to combat violent gang-related crime and poverty. But as of now, the Bat Phone remains silent..  Barry Richard is the host of The Barry Richard Show on 1420 WBSM New Bedford.

954,"If the eventual Democratic nominee for president defeats Donald Trump in November and is sincere about addressing the reparations issue that has been central to the Democrats’ debate s, they might already have a blueprint to follow..  City officials in Evanston, Illinois, in an effort led by Alderwoman Robin Sue Simmons, have agreed to use taxes from the sale of recreational marijuana to fund a local reparations program..  The move makes the Chicago suburb’s City Council the first legislative body in the country to address compensation to the descendants of enslaved people..  Officials and activists here in Philadelphia honored Simmons for her work on Reparations Awareness Day, which was Feb. 25..  “She actually got something done,” said Philadelphia City Councilman Kenyatta Johnson, who presented Simmons with resolutions and a small gift from City Council. “It’s easy to introduce the bill, but what are you doing to make sure that bill gets passed?”.  “What she has done is historic in the reparations movement,” said Osaze Osayada, male co-chairman of the Philadelphia chapter of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America (N’COBRA). “They have a defined plan of who is going to get it and where the money is going to come from.”.  Simmons’ plan stems from the idea that African Americans should gain the most from the sale of cannabis because Blacks have suffered the most due to the policing of marijuan a..  “Our community was damaged due to the war on drugs and marijuana convictions and this is an opportunity to make that right,” said Simmons, who is Black. “It’s part of the larger picture. The Black community has suffered incalculable trauma stemming from slaver y, redlinin g, Jim Crow and the war on drug s. It didn’t just end with the end of slavery.”.  Evanston has approximately 74,100 residents, approximately 16.6% of whom are Black, according to Census dat a. Simmons represents the city’s predominantly African-American Fifth Ward..  Illinois approved the sale of recreational marijuana last June, and the first sales of recreational cannabis were allowed on Jan. 1..  Evanston city officials still are deciding what form the reparations will take..  The Evanston City Council’s Reparations Subcommittee, headed by Simmons, has begun meetings around issues of housing discrimination, mental and emotional health, and other issues such as mass incarceration and income inequality, all residues, Simmons said, “of the trauma that still exists today in the African-American community” due to the trans-Atlantic slave trade..  Other cities have taken note of the pla n. Simmons says she has heard from “more than a dozen elected leaders in other cities across the nation,” all of them larger than Evanston. Her hope is that other municipal and state governments and the federal government will pay attention to what Evanston is doing..  “I believe that this is a model that can be used in cities across the nation,” Simmons said. “My hope is that Evanston won’t necessarily be the blueprint, but we can be the inspiration. Every city is going to have different damages and different opportunities to fund it. The remedies might look different; the demographics of cities are different..  “We’re certainly here to answer any questions about our process, but each community will need to look at their communities specific to moving forward with reparations,” Simmons continued. “This needs to be layered on at a municipal, state and federal level, at institutions big and small. We’re all responsible for the damages done to the Black community.”.  In Pennsylvania, Democratic state Rep. Chris Rabb has announced plans to introduce a bill addressing systemic racism in Pennsylvani a. It would be the first bill of its kind calling for a state to make restitution for systemic racism..  “The bottom line is reparations help everyone,” said Rabb, in attendance Wednesday. “It helps society at all levels. That’s a message that is really important. No one can be truly competitive or know what justice is if a whole subset of society is being oppressed.”.  215-893-5732","[0.5011135339736938, 0.49888643622398376]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5011135339736938

959,"E-learning a challenge Chicago schools amid virus closures Updated 10:12 am EDT, Saturday, March 28, 2020.  CHICAGO (AP) — Unprecedented school closures in Illinois caused by the coronavirus pandemic have left many school systems with a major challenge to improve e-learning methods..  Schools are closed statewide through at least April 7, with the possibility of more extensions. Of particular concern is Chicago Public Schools, where a majority of students are considered economically disadvantaged, lacking proper devices or inadequate internet access at home, the Chicago Tribune reported..  Of households within the boundaries of CPS, about 14% didn’t have a home computer and 24% lack a broadband internet subscription, according to 2018 U.S. Census Bureau data..  Rather than wait for officials to act, parents and teachers have taken matters into their own hands, including a public video plea on Twitter from the principal at Passage Charter School in Andersonville asking for donations of laptops or tablets..  “We serve mostly immigrant and refugee students, and we have a real need for devices for online learning,” Principal Jeremy Riggs said in the video. “There is a huge equity issue for me. In order for all of our kids to have access, we need some help."".  CPS officials say they're doing “whatever we can to help bridge the digital divide” for the district's 355,000 students. The Board of Education unanimously approved a $75 million coronavirus spending proposal that will be used for a new “device equity strategy.”.  Some internet providers such as Comcast and AT&T have all taken measures to help, including adding free broadband internet for two months for new low-income customers..  “We’re seeing really strong interest in the offer,” Comcast spokesman Jack Segal said in an email. “We’ve been doing outreach to schools and school districts, veteran-serving organizations and partners that work with seniors to make sure low-income households in our footprint know and are doing our best to help as many people as we can get online.”.

In partnership with the philanthropic arm of Ford Motor Company, the Chicago Urban League is launching the Emergency Capital Access Program (ECAP) to provide small grants, technical assistance, and advisory services to Black-owned small businesses that have been negatively affected by COVID-19. The League’s Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation will deliver the program and expects to provide grants up to $5,000 to about 20 businesses..  The program is part of the League’s COVID-19 Community Help Center, launched in April. Business owners will be able to apply for the program through the Help Center website beginning August 17..  “Over the past few months, our Help Center has worked with hundreds of small business owners to assist them in recovering from interruption caused by the pandemic, and the need is still great,” said Chicago Urban League President & CEO Karen Freeman-Wilson. “This new initiative and support from Ford will help us make a difference for more local, Black-owned businesses and the communities they serve.”.  Ford created ECAP as a pilot program with the National Urban League to offer crucial economic support to businesses that provide a stabilizing influence for communities hard hit by the pandemic..  Chicago was one of six National Urban League affiliates to receive $100,000 from Ford to deliver the program..  “Small businesses are a cornerstone of the African American community and play a vital role in their economic success,” said Pamela Alexander, director of Community Development, Ford Motor Company Fund..  “The impact of the COVID pandemic has created economic uncertainty that necessitates immediate action..  Our long-term partnership with the National Urban League allows us to quickly mobilize an initiative such as the Emergency Capital Access Program to get immediate assistance to those businesses in need.”.  Here’s how the program will work in Chicago: The League’s Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation will recruit qualified businesses as possible grant recipients. Qualified applicants will be awarded grants of $2,000 – $5,000 for the remainder of 2020. Qualified applicants must participate in pre-grant counseling services to access short-term needs. Funding priority will be given to “person-to-person” businesses heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and those located in Census tracts with greater than 25% Black residency..  For more details about the program, visit the COVID-19 Community Help Center website, [ www.culcovid19.com .[CC1]]..  “Access to capital is one of the biggest hurdles Black-owned businesses face, and the pandemic has only widened the racial disparity,” National Urban League President and CEO Marc H. Morial said. “Far-sighted and enlightened partners like Ford are essential to rebuilding an economy that is both fair and thriving. We’re extremely grateful for Ford’s support.”.

In investing $2 million over two years to bolster Chicago West Side communities, the AMA is showing its commitment to fight social and economic barriers to optimal health and acknowledging that health is created beyond the walls of hospitals and doctors’ offices..  At an event announcing the investment, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot shared her “gratitude with Dr. James Madara and everyone at the AMA for their commitment to creating equity here in Chicago. … The AMA has a national reach as we all know, but we are proud that it continues to call Chicago home.” Fostering healthier communities.  This episode of AMA Doc Talk explores how physicians can better serve their patients by thinking beyond the walls of the exam room. Listen Now (Apple Podcasts).  At the event, Dr. Madara, the AMA’s Executive Vice President and CEO, noted the tremendous barriers faced by West Side families, which then contribute to an alarming 14-year gap in life expectancy compared to those living in communities only a short distance away..  The AMA’s investment is part of an overall contribution of $6 million made by a partnership of six Chicago hospital systems and partners committed to West Side United , mission that seeks to cut in half the life-expectancy gap that exists between the city’s affluent communities and its poor West Side neighborhoods. According to U.S. Census data, nearly one-fifth of Chicago’s West Side households live below the poverty level. Nearly half of the area’s residents are black; 34% are Hispanic and 17% are white..  The funds will be invested through four community development financial institutions (CDFIs)—mission-driven financial institutions certified by the U.S. Department of Treasury to finance businesses, nonprofits, micro enterprises, and affordable housing serving low-income communities. The CDFIs will offer loan capital to small businesses and organizations throughout the West Side based on the community’s needs, such as improving access to affordable housing and healthy foods, financing local business projects, or supporting job creation efforts and educational programs.

Learn more about the AMA’s West Side United investment and the AMA’s work on health equity , which recognizes that systemwide bias and institutionalized racism continue to contribute to inequities across the U.S. health system. The AMA is fighting for greater health equity by identifying and eliminating inequities through advocacy, community leadership and education. Our town.  The event at which Lightfoot and Dr. Madara spoke was in the historic Austin Town Hall building constructed in 1870. Dr. Madara noted that the AMA has been headquartered in Chicago since 1888..  “Improving the health of Chicago communities is also really personal for us,” he said. “This is our town.”.  That sentiment was echoed by Omar Lateef, DO, CEO of Rush University Medical Center, a West Side United member organization..  “We’ve been on the West Side of Chicago for 180 years and this is our community,” Dr. Lateef said. “We’re a large business on the West Side of Chicago. How we hire, purchase and invest, we’re learning, can actually make a profound difference.”.  The goal is that these business decisions will lead to the hospital’s neighbors “living longer and better lives,” Dr. Lateef said..  According to the Democracy Collaborative’s Healthcare Anchor Network, if health systems nationwide redirect even a small portion of their investment assets to place-based investments, billions of dollars would be shifted toward addressing economic and environmental disparities in local communities..  In an AMA Leadership Viewpoints column about the West Side United commitment, AMA President Patrice A. Harris, MD, MA, wrote that helping achieve greater health care equity was an essential element of the AMA’s mission to improve public health..  “We strive to ensure that all people have access to appropriate, high-quality, evidence-based care—no matter who they are or where they live,” Dr. Harris wrote. “There is a growing recognition and response among physicians that structural, social, economic and political pressures can harm the health of the public, particularly in marginalized communities that often confront significant barriers to achieving optimal health.” A tale of two fires.  Famously, much of Chicago was rebuilt rapidly after the great fire of 1871, but little has been done on a two-mile strip of the West Side’s main commercial district that was destroyed after fires swept through the area following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King in 1968.

She added that “success breeds success,” and that others will take notice when they see the commitment being made toward restoring the health of the West Side..  “My expectation is that this $6 million certainly will go a long way in helping those that will be the recipients, but it will also spur and attract other investment,” Lightfoot said, adding that West Side United efforts could be a model to use in other parts of the city..  In an AMA video , Dr. Harris called on physicians and health systems to look for opportunities in their neighborhoods and towns to identify and remove barriers to health care access..  “Together, we can bring greater equity in health care, one community at a time,” she said..  Similarly, Dr. Madara closed his remarks by thanking “physicians everywhere and in every community” who understand the importance of health equity and work tirelessly to achieve it..

While population drops in Illinois and Chicago have gained significant attention in recent years, a growing number of workers and households have led to an increase in road travel, according to a new white paper from the Urban Transportation Center at UIC..  Through an examination of federal data from the last decade covering trends in population, jobs, number of households, labor force participation and income, UIC transportation researchers analyzed how these variables collectively led to more vehicle miles traveled in the state and city during the time in which population has been declining..  The new report, co-authored by Siim Sööt, former director of the center, and P.S. Sriraj, director of the center and research associate professor at UIC, also suggests encouraging economic trends in the Land of Lincoln..  “Increases in employment and a growing number of households lead to the consumption of big-ticket items such as appliances, cars and homes. They counteract a drop in population,” the report states..  From a transportation perspective, the number of jobs, amount of households and figures of household income in a particular region are more important than the number of people, according to the researchers..  Since 2010, Illinois has lost approximately 100,000 residents, but the number of jobs has jumped by nearly 600,000. Given the population developments, the census data and homeownership rates suggest that while large households are leaving, they are being replaced by small households..  Another key determining factor related to travel is household income, they said..  Despite Illinois’ decreasing population, real median household incomes in the state have increased by nearly $12,000 since 2014. Incomes are higher than at any time this millennium and remain above those in Kentucky, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Michigan, which also shares a border via the Lake Michigan water boundary..  The researchers indicate that household incomes in Illinois initially declined, but have sharply recovered to outpace the incomes in the adjacent states..  For example, in 2018 Illinois’ median household income level was $7,000 ahead of the national median and Wisconsin, and $10,000 higher than Indiana..  Illinois homeownership is near the national level but much higher than in peer states – California, Texas and New York — where rates are pulled down by the largest metropolitan areas..  Together these factors have led to rising numbers of miles traveled on the state’s highways especially in urban areas like Chicago, which indicates that congestion is growing..  “It may reflect more commuting to and from work, more shopping trips, more freight being transported or a host of other transportation needs as jobs increase and households are formed,” they reported..

976,"I wrote this article for the Lawrence County Genealogical Society newsletter early 2006. I’m sharing my older articles on my blog so that they might help researchers online..  My interest in the Ackman family begins with my great-great-great-great grandmother, Artemecia Jane Ackman, born 30 October, 1846, in Kenton County, Kentucky. She was the daughter of Isaac Ackman and Nancy Harmon, who, by 1850, were established in Schuyler County in Western Illinois. When I moved to Lawrence County, bordering Indiana on the eastern side of Illinois, I noticed the Ackman name in the area. It didn’t take long to find a connection between the Lawrence County family and the Kenton County clan..  Alma Ackman Rainey published a history of the Ackman family in 1965. In her work, A History of the Ackman Family, 1695-1965 , she traced the Southeast Illinois Ackmans, and also included some of the Western Illinois branches..  Rainey’s work states that there were three brothers, William, Charles, and John, who fought in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. She gives an incomplete list of the children of William Ackman (Norton’s ancestor). She also states that Charles Ackman married Sallie Johnson, the daughter of Thomas Johnson who was related to the Johnsons of Georgetown, Kentucky. The children of Charles and Sallie Johnson are listed as Rebecca, born 26 March, 1807; Henry, Mary Ann, Malissa, Sally, and John. Charles Johnson “Johnst” Ackman, born in Maryland, 02 September, 1825, died Sept. 7, 1870..  Her words are vague, but it seems she believed the father of Charles Johnson was this older Charles who married Sallie Johnson..  “Charles Ackman died at sea. After the death of Charles Ackman the family moved to northern Kentucky where Charles Johnson Ackman grew to manhood. He later went to Lawrence County, Illinois—entered land and bought the same outright. Married Nancy Jane Berkshire of Boon County, Kentucky; born July 8, 1829—died July 26, 1897. Married June 15, 1848 by the Justice of the Peace James Nabb, Lawrenceville, Illinois. Children: Francis Marion, born 1849; Charles Henry, born 1851; George Washington, born 1854; Theodore, born 1855; California, born 1858; John Wesley, born 1861; Mary Ann, born 1868; and Howard Johnson, born 1870.”.  There seems to have been some confusion between Charles Johnson “Johnst” Ackman of Lawrence County, and an older, earlier Lawrence County man named, Charles Ackman. Records in Lawrence County, Illinois, prove that Charles Johnson Ackman was the son of Charles and Margaret Ackman, not Charles and Sallie. The Charles and Sallie Ackman that Mrs. Rainey named are most likely, Johnst’s grandparents..  Dorchester County, Maryland, marriages list the union of Charles Ackman to Sarah Walker on 11 May, 1796. The birth of Charles Johnson Ackman is sometimes given as Dorchester County, Maryland, so there is a strong probability that these people are the Charles and Sally that Rainey describes. However, Sally (often a nickname for Sarah) is not a Johnson, she is a Walker..  A Charles Ackman is listed in Fayette County, Kentucky in the 1830 census. This man had married Margaret Johnson on 10 November, 1824. (Fayette County Kentucky Records, Vol. III, by Cook and Cook lists Acman as ACMAR.) Benjamin M. Taul was surety for this marriage. By 1830, the couple had two males and one female under 10 in their household..  Charles Ackman and his wife, Margaret, moved to Lawrence County, Illinois. He entered land on 6 January, 1837. The family is listed in the 1840 census with the following data: One male 40-50 (Charles), one female 40-50 (Margaret), two males and one female 10-15 (Charles Johnson, John Henry, and Mary Ann), three females 5-10 (Sarah, Margaret, and Susan), and one female under 5 (Rebecca)..  This Charles Ackman died on 5 February, 1849, leaving a will. In it he names his wife, Margaret, and sons, John Henry and Charles Johnson. The daughters are mentioned, but not named. The later estates of John Henry and Johnson verify the names of these daughters..  Charles Ackman is buried in the Ackman-Hollister Cemetery, south of Lawrenceville on Route 1. The tombstone reads, “Charles Acman, born March 27, 1801, Died February 5, 1849, 48 years.” (Note: Irene Black’s Cemeteries of Lawrence County , 1976, gives the death as 1819 and the age as 18. The correct date and age were verified at the cemetery by Norton, December 2006.).  The 1850 Census of Lawrence County, Illinois, listed the widow and her family living next door to Charles Johnson and his new wife..  Denison Township.

It is a survey that is mandated by the Constitution and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, a nonpartisan government agency. The 2020 Census counts the population in the United States and five U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). It counts people and the specific demographics of race and gender per area..  Each year, Census data informs federal funding for more than 100 programs, including school lunches, highway construction, and education. Over the next decade, lawmakers, business owners, and many others will use 2020 Census data to make critical decisions. The results will show where communities need new schools, new health clinics, new roads, and more services for families, older adults, and children..  Completing the census is one more way you can help your community. When you fill out the census, you help amplify your community’s voice and ensure federal funds go to support critical services..  You only have until September 30, 2020 to be counted in the Census, so don’t wait!.  Make sure you are counted this year by taking the Census by phone (844.330.2020) or online ( 2020census.gov ).

978,"Using Representable, residents can input information about their communities — geographic borders, historical information, cultural and ethnic members and economic factors — to draw more “actionable” maps for use by lawmakers during redistricting, said company co-founder Preet Iyer..  This latest attempt by CHANGE at reform comes after the failure of a proposed constitutional amendment that would have created an independent redistricting commission. The amendment did not get the requisite legislative support it needed before a May 3 deadline, after the Illinois General Assembly halted its session in March in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic..  The state’s Constitution specifies that lawmakers have until June 30, 2021, to create an agreed-upon redistricting plan. If they are unsuccessful, a bipartisan commission will be convened to finish the job..  Ryan Tolley, policy director for CHANGE Illinois, said both the House and Senate held at least 15 hearings in 2011 — the last year legislators were tasked with drawing new maps — to hear from communities about their representation needs. The group’s partnership with Representable is meant to encourage residents to attend any hearings with tangible proposals. Some Carbondale restaurants put business on hold until local COVID cases stabilize.  “Even though we weren’t able to change the process, we can’t just let the remap go forward without making a concerted effort to ensure our communities are playing an active role in advocating for themselves,” Tolley said. “It’s so vitally important for these communities to be at the table, because everyone’s ability to advocate for themselves over the next decade is going to, in part, be dictated by this.”.  Complicating the General Assembly’s timetable this year is uncertainty the U.S. Census Bureau will get states, President Donald Trump and Congress the data it is tasked with obtaining and analyzing in time..  Due to COVID-19, census workers were delayed by three or four months in outreach and counting efforts this year, Jay Young, executive director of Common Cause, said. The bureau asked for an extension to report information to the federal and state governments, but later retracted that request. Common Cause is a nonpartisan government watchdog group..  “Whatever is going to happen, it is not clear when data will ultimately get first to the president and then to the states to allow them to do their remap,” Young said. “There are lots of things that feel broken right now, and even if you set aside all the things already going on in the General Assembly that makes things complicated and confusing and hard to predict, this is the sort of task that is going to be especially complicated.” Low census response across Southern Illinois puts millions of federal dollars at risk.  The situation in Illinois will be “particularly messy,” he added, in underserved communities classified as traditionally hard to count..  In a news release announcing Representable, CHANGE Illinois wrote that “in too many previous redistricting cycles, politicians draw districts that splinter and split up neighborhoods and communities of people with common bonds… Splitting up neighborhoods or natural communities dilutes people’s political power and advocacy strength.”.

979,"Illinois Historic Preservation Tax Credit Program Encourages Economic Revitalization / MyRadioLink.com Jul 10, 2020 8:53 AM.  For Immediate Release.  Illinois Historic Preservation Tax Credit Program Encourages Economic Revitalization.  SPRINGFIELD, Ill. – The Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) today announced the third round of recipients of the Illinois Historic Preservation Tax Credit Program, a statewide historic preservation incentive that encourages private investment in historic properties across Illinois..  “What’s great about this program is that it encourages substantial private investment and leverages federal tax credits to create construction jobs, boost local economies and bring underutilized buildings back to life and back onto the tax rolls,” said IDNR Director Colleen Callahan. “The rehabilitations and the businesses that relocate into them generate millions of dollars in state and local tax revenues, so it really a win-win for communities and business owners.”.  The state tax credit program gives priority to buildings that are in low-income census tracts, federally declared disaster areas, and counties that border a state with a competitive statewide historic tax credit. Buildings that were once owned by a governmental entity and whose development partnership includes a Community Development Entity, a low-profit organization, or a not-for-profit organization also are given priority for an allocation..  Four building rehabilitation projects received allocations for state income tax credits in the first of this year’s two application rounds. These projects have and will continue to create local construction jobs to help restart the state’s economy. Bloomington High School at 510 E. Washington Street in Bloomington is being converted into Washington Senior Apartments, an affordable over-55 community. • Garfield Elementary School at 1518 25th Avenue, in Moline has been successfully rehabilitated into affordable senior housing. • Shimer College campus at 203 E. Seminary Street, in Mt. Carroll is being transformed into a mixed-use neighborhood with residential, commercial, and community amenities. • West Pullman Elementary School at 11941 S. Parnell Avenue, in Chicago, one of the 49 schools closed across Chicago in 2013, is being renovated into 60-units of affordable senior housing..  The Illinois Historic Preservation Tax Credit Program, administered by the IDNR State Historic Preservation Office, is available to owners of historic structures who undertake certified rehabilitations making them eligible for a tax credit of 25 percent of their qualified rehabilitation costs up to $3 million per project. Credits are limited to a total of $15 million in allocations per year, with a total of $75 million in tax credits available over the five years that the program is to be in effect..  During this first round of the second year of the Illinois Historic Preservation Tax Credit Program, complete applications received represented 16 historic properties in nine different communities across the state. The total private reinvestment of all project applications is estimated to exceed $290 million. The total amount of credits requested were approximately $29.3 million, and $7.5 million of credits were able to be allocated. The rehabilitation tax credits are awarded only after substantial private investment has been made in local communities..

Devon during regular business hours. Please call before coming to make sure a staff member is available to pick up the food outside the office. Staff will wear masks and gloves and follow social distancing procedures. Please consider donating non-perishable food, clothing, and any other goods you can spare—every item helps! Utility Billing Relief The City of Chicago is launching the Utility Billing Relief (UBR) Program—a new initiative to make water and sewer charges more affordable for low-income residents. Water is a basic human right. This new program will make it so families do not have to choose between paying for utilities and other needed services. The new program offers a reduced rate on water, sewer, and the water-sewer tax for homeowners who meet LIHEAP income eligibility criteria . It also puts a hold on late payment penalties and debt collection for outstanding bills, and offers debt forgiveness after successfully completing one year with no past due balance. Interested residents can apply for the program at www.chicago.gov/UBR . For more information, call (312) 744-4426 or email . Chicago Census Challenge Chicago has launched a citywide challenge to see which ward can deliver the highest increase in census response. The winning ward will get ice cream for the entire neighborhood's children. Take the census now at my2020census.gov or by calling 844-330-2020. The Census Challenge has already begun and will go through July 17. I am pleased to say that our neighborhood is currently in third place out of the city's 50 wards. However, there are still nearly 8,000 uncounted households in the 50th Ward, so we have a lot of work to do! Information collected from the census is used to ensure equal political representation and fair allocation of government resources. This cycle, more than $800 billion in federal funding is at stake for everything from education and healthcare to infrastructure and social safety net programs. Visit www.chicago.gov/census for more information about the Census Challenge and how you can help our city! Block Parties Canceled The Department of Transportation has canceled all block parties in Chicago through September 7, 2020. This decision is based on recommendations from the CDC and local and state health officials. Block parties may not be happening, but the City is still holding plenty of remote and socially distant cultural events this summer.

982,"About a third of Illinois households still need to fill out their 2020 census forms, according to the U.S. Census Bureau ..  Census officials touted Wednesday upcoming efforts to encourage people to participate in the census before the in-person follow-up begins, which was delayed until this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic..  The efforts include more paid advertising and census takers standing outside grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential businesses to help people fill out the forms. A spokesman for the regional census office in Chicago could not confirm if workers would be posted outside of Illinois businesses in the next few weeks..  People who fill out the form – or self-respond – avoid getting an in-person visit, said Tim Olson, associate director of field operations for the U.S. Census Bureau..  “We believe that through these new efforts that we’re launching in a week from now we’ll even achieve a higher self-response than what we have now,” Olson said on a call with reporters..  The federal agency has extended the timeframe for when residents can fill out the form online , over the phone or by mail through October 31..  Nationwide, the self-response rate is 61.9%, while Illinois’ is 66.7%, according to a map on the Census Bureau’s website. The Prairie State is ahead of most others, but lags behind the 70.5% response rate from the 2010 Census..  The overall response rate is good, said Jay Young, director of Common Cause Illinois – a Chicago-based civic engagement group working to ensure an accurate count. But he said there are still concerns about certain demographics being undercounted..  “The hard-to-count communities that we thought were going to be hard to count on the outset still remain communities of concern – the immigrant communities, children under five, people who have food insecurity, housing insecurity,” he said..  The coronavirus pandemic has hampered some efforts to ensure all Illinoisans participate..  Young said advocates across the state had planned in-person events for the spring and summer. Before the pandemic hit and restrictions on gatherings were put in place, Common Cause asked its members to plan house parties where people could fill out their census forms and organize efforts to make sure their whole block was counted..  Now, Young said they're sending emails or phone banking. Other groups are handing out census education material at school lunch pick-ups..  “They’re really thinking about what your community is doing in this time and trying to connect there,” Young said..  One bit of good news, said Young, is that Illinois, unlike most states, is still providing more than $14 million in grants to local governments and nonprofits to promote census participation..  On Thursday, the governor extended the life of the statewide Census Advisory Panel, which recommends how to spend the money, through the end of the year..  The pandemic has also changed the bureau’s operations. Door-to-door canvassing that was supposed to start in May got pushed to this summer. Census workers are set to begin in most of the U.S. in mid-August. Work will begin sooner in parts of Missouri, Indiana, Kansas and eight more states..  Census officials said their workers will be equipped with masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, and will be advised to keep a six-foot distance from those they interview.

984,"Illinois is in a precarious position when it comes to the 2020 census. The count determines congressional representation, and the state is at risk for losing up to two seats..  Central and southern Illinois appear most vulnerable to losing a congressional seat, which is why it’s especially important to make sure everyone participates, according to Anita Banerji, director of the Democracy Initiative with Forefront Illinois. The Chicago-based civic engagement nonprofit has been working to ensure an accurate count..  Representatives from the farm bureau, local governments and other nonprofits met in Springfield recently to learn how to promote census participation in rural areas. About 12% of Illinois' population lives in small towns and sparsely populated areas..  Banerji said there are unique challenges to getting an accurate count in these places..  “It's the lack of access to technology. It's the distrust in government,” she said. “It's the lack of awareness, lack of connectivity to community resources.”.  Banerji said local and state governments should partner with churches, PTAs and farm bureaus to get the message out about participating in the census..  “You've got so many different of these historically undercounted populations that are residing in rural Illinois, that the messaging looks different,” she said..  She presented with U.S. Census Bureau regional director Ellissa Johnson to the U.S. Department of Agricultural Illinois Rural partners..  Johnson said while the vast majority of households will get mail reminders to fill out the form online, certain households in rural areas will get a paper copy dropped off, which they can fill out and mail back. A map of those areas is on the Census website ..  The bureau is hiring more than 18,000 workers across the state to assist with the tally..  Johnson said they’re looking for individuals to go door-to-door to assist people who did not respond online after the mail-in reminders with filling out the forms..  “So we want to make sure that we're hiring individuals from certain communities,” she said. “If you live in that community, we want to make sure that we're hiring from those communities, so that people can be familiar with who's knocking on their doors.”.  Macomb Mayor Mike Inman said only about 30% of the positions for census workers in McDonough County have been filled..  Inman said the pay is $17.50 per hour. He said mileage will be paid for workers who use their own vehicle for the job. And there is another reason why some people might find the temporary positions appealing..  ""For those folks that are getting supplemental income from either SNAP or TANF or some other state or federal aid, this income will not affect those aid components to those individuals,"" he said..  Inman said training will start early next year and some positions could continue into early summer..  Information about census jobs can be found on the 2020 Census website ..  The count begins in January with those in nursing homes, college dorms, prisons and other group housing. More information can be found on the website – census dot gov..  Residents can expect a first letter directing them to fill out census forms online in mid-March..  Rich Egger with Tri-States Public Radio in Macomb contributed to this report.

If voters in November approve a switch from a flat to a graduated income tax, income will increase in six months. “In the budget we passed,” said House Majority Leader Greg Harris (D-Chicago), “we did not count on revenue from the progressive income tax.” The budget relies heavily on borrowing from the federal government, but Harris says the state already qualifies for several billion dollars. “We watch our revenue numbers every month,” said Harris, in an interview this week. “We built enough flexibility into the budget so that we can exchange federal revenues for Federal Reserve borrowing, so we have a lot of flexibility so we can respond every month. Even if the legislature cannot come back, we built that in.” After cancelling most of the spring session, the House and Senate returned for four days in May to complete the budget.

Top Census Bureau officials have said it would be impossible to meet the end-of-the-year deadline, and that the bureau expected bipartisan support for the request..  The request passed the Democratic-controlled House as part of coronavirus-relief legislation but it has not gone anywhere in the Republican-controlled Senate.

999,"A 102-year-old former Chicago teacher donned an unconventional outfit to cast her vote Thursday — a pink-and-white hazmat suit..  A picture on the Chicago Teachers Union’s Twitter account captured the moment Beatrice Lumpkin dropped her mail-in ballot into a mailbox: “Good morning! This is 102-year-old CTU retiree Bea Lumpkin casting her vote-by-mail ballot,” the union wrote..  “If Bea can do it, anyone can do it. Vote!”.  The longtime Chicago teacher was surrounded by fellow Chicago Teachers Union members as she fulfilled her civic duty, according to Fox News..  “Bea is truly universally beloved in our union, where she remains an active and dedicated retiree who shows up at as many picket lines and union events as she can, and remains very active in our work, plus writes occasionally for our monthly member publication, Chicago Union Teacher, most recently on the desperate need to address climate change,” a spokesman for the CTU told the network..  Lumpkin, despite her age, remains active in the union and, until the pandemic hit, regularly attended protests along with her fellow members — in March 2019, CTU posted a video on Facebook of her at the age of 100, protesting at the Chicago International Charter School headquarters..

My dad has a condo in Miami which I can stay in the spare bedroom, and my mom a house in Chicago which has another spare bedroom that I can stay in. However, I am getting to the point where I want to invest in real estate..  Curious which you think is a better real estate market for someone looking to buy something in the $250k-$400k range?

1006,"in Daily Dose , Featured , Foreclosure , News 5 hours ago 42 Views.  Illinois’ housing market was one of the weakest in the nation prior to 2020, Illinois Policy reports. If the unemployment rate remains high and if demand does not continue to outpace supply in housing markets across the state, close to 130,000 households could fall behind on their mortgage payments. This means Illinois’ mortgage delinquency rate could double to nearly 9%, the highest since it peaked at 11% during the Great Recession..  Illinois has had the third-lowest housing price appreciation in the United States on average since the end of the Great Recession. Weak housing appreciation is largely tied to declining demand as Illinois continues to experience population decline and more Illinoisans continue to favor renting over homeownership. Despite relatively low home prices and mortgage rates, homeownership is further discouraged by added costs such as property taxes, which are second-highest in the nation..  Other than the cost of their loans, property taxes are often Illinois homeowners’ largest annual housing expense. Recent homeowners likely make the equivalent of nearly seven additional mortgage payments each year because of property taxes. he median Illinoisan with a mortgage pays $4,900 in property taxes on their $203,400 home, a property tax rate of 2.4% (the WalletHub survey includes those without a mortgage and shows Illinois’ property tax rate at 2.3%, both are second highest in the nation). This is the third consecutive year Illinois ranked No. 2 in the property tax survey..  Now that 1.5 million Illinoisans have lost their jobs and income has fallen, many families may fall behind on their mortgage payments. Using data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the Illinois Policy Institute projection for mortgage delinquency uses the relationship between aggregate unemployment, housing price appreciation and aggregate mortgage delinquency..  ""With many Illinois homeowners uncertain about how they will be able to pay the bills, state lawmakers should return to Springfield for a special session to provide relief for these families or more counties should act to delay due dates,"" said Illinois Policy.","[0.9382990598678589, 0.06170092523097992]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.9382990598678589

1008,"St. Jane de Chantal elementary school Google Street View Five Catholic elementary schools, one of them in Chicago and the rest in the suburbs, are set to close at the end of the school year because of low enrollment and financial trouble, the Archdiocese of Chicago announced Monday. The Chicago school, St. Jane de Chantal in Garfield Ridge on the Southwest Side, has lost almost 100 students in the past three years and missed its fundraising goal to keep the school open one more year, the archdiocese said. “School closures are difficult and complicated and we realize the impact this has on students, their families and our staff,” said Jim Rigg, superintendent of Catholic Schools, in a statement. “The archdiocese will be working with each affected student and employee to assist them in finding places at other Catholic schools.” St. Jane employed 14 teachers and six staff members, and enrolled 202 K-8 students during the 2018-19 school year, according to state records. The school had 245 students in the 2017-18 school year, 272 in 2016-17 and 281 in 2015-16, records show. The suburban schools the archdiocese plans to shut down are St. Colette in Rolling Meadows; St. Joseph in Round Lake; St. Louise de Marillac in La Grange Park; and St. Maria Goretti in Schiller Park. The archdiocese currently educates more than 70,000 students at 209 schools. The closings come after the Chicago Sun-Times reported in February 2019 that the archdiocese is more than $200 million in debt , mostly related to sex abuse claims. An archdiocese spokeswoman said those financial troubles are unrelated to the school closings and instead cited individual schools’ fundraising failures and statewide population decline as reasons why the schools could no longer afford to operate. The archdiocese works with schools to set fundraising goals, and there’s a limit on how much the schools can be supported if they can’t sustain themselves, the spokeswoman said. The Catholic church has also endured decades of declines in attendance, with a 2018 Archdiocese of Chicago report finding only 20% of Chicago-area Catholics went to church that October.

As we start a new spring legislative session, I remain committed to working with local and state officials to make the kind of changes that will help boost Illinois’ economy, keep our residents and businesses from leaving, and protect taxpayers..  Seclusion rooms face public scrutiny.  Following a public outcry about the investigation released by the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica detailing the use of isolation rooms throughout the state’s public schools, lawmakers held their first hearing about the controversial practice..  The scathing report described overuse of physical restraint and isolated timeouts, prompting state lawmakers to gather on Jan. 7 for a joint hearing in Chicago to discuss legislation to ban the use of solitary confinement rooms. According to the report, more than 20,000 incidents of isolation were used in schools in less than two years..  Until the report, students could be isolated or restrained if they were deemed a safety threat to themselves or others. After the report was released, the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) took action to ban “isolated seclusion” in schools..  Further investigation is being done by the ISBE to gather data on public schools’ seclusion practices and incidents. Meanwhile, two bills—Senate Bill 2315 and House Bill 3975—have been introduced to ban schools from placing a student in seclusion..  Comptroller pumps brakes on red-light camera debt.  In the midst of ethical probes at the Capitol, the state’s Office of the Comptroller has recently announced that it will no longer assist municipalities in collecting fines for violations caught by red-light cameras. The red-light camera industry and contracts with local municipalities and political officials have recently come under scrutiny as federal investigations continue..  In 2012, the General Assembly authorized municipalities and other local governments to use the Office of the Comptroller to help collect debts resulting from unpaid traffic tickets. Outstanding debts were collected from violators by withholding state income tax refunds or other payments..  According to the Office of the Comptroller, this method of collection has been used to recover unpaid child support, overpayment of benefits, and other types of debt..  The Comptroller Office’s assistance with unpaid traffic tickets from red-light cameras will come to an end on Feb. 6..  It is anticipated that red-light cameras will be a topic of discussion during the spring legislative session. Legislation has been filed to analyze the use of the cameras and to ban red-light cameras..  Tax credit offered to small businesses in wake of minimum wage hike.  Effective Jan. 1, Illinois’ minimum wage increased from $8.25 per hour to $9.25 per hour, putting additional cost burdens on small-business owners across the state. Wages will continue to increase incrementally to $15 per hour by 2025..  To help offset increased costs to the business community, small businesses are being encouraged to take advantage of a tax credit available to businesses and nonprofits with 50 full-time equivalent employees or fewer..  The Minimum Wage Credit will allow small businesses a maximum credit of 25 percent of the difference between the new minimum wage and what each employee was paid previously. The percentage allowed each proceeding year will decrease before it sunsets in 2026. Businesses can begin to claim the credit on their quarterly Illinois Withholding Income Tax Returns..  While this is not a long-term solution for small businesses, it will provide a measure of relief to employers as they face the hardships imposed by the minimum wage increase.

According to the report, more than 20,000 incidents of isolation were used in schools in less than two years..  Until the report, students could be isolated or restrained if they were deemed a safety threat to themselves or others. After the report was released, the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) took action to ban “isolated seclusion” in schools..  Further investigation is being done by the ISBE to gather data on public schools’ seclusion practices and incidents. Meanwhile, two bills—Senate Bill 2315 and House Bill 3975—have been introduced to ban schools from placing a student in seclusion..  Comptroller pumps brakes on red-light camera debt.  In the midst of ethical probes at the Capitol, the state’s Office of the Comptroller has recently announced that it will no longer assist municipalities in collecting fines for violations caught by red-light cameras. The red-light camera industry and contracts with local municipalities and political officials have recently come under scrutiny as federal investigations continue..  In 2012, the General Assembly authorized municipalities and other local governments to use the Office of the Comptroller to help collect debts resulting from unpaid traffic tickets. Outstanding debts were collected from violators by withholding state income tax refunds or other payments..  According to the Office of the Comptroller, this method of collection has been used to recover unpaid child support, overpayment of benefits, and other types of debt..  The Comptroller Office’s assistance with unpaid traffic tickets from red-light cameras will come to an end on Feb. 6..  It is anticipated that red-light cameras will be a topic of discussion during the spring legislative session. Legislation has been filed to analyze the use of the cameras and to ban red-light cameras..  Tax credit offered to small businesses in wake of minimum wage hike.  Effective Jan. 1, Illinois’ minimum wage increased from $8.25 per hour to $9.25 per hour, putting additional cost burdens on small-business owners across the state. Wages will continue to increase incrementally to $15 per hour by 2025..  To help offset increased costs to the business community, small businesses are being encouraged to take advantage of a tax credit available to businesses and nonprofits with 50 full-time equivalent employees or fewer..  The Minimum Wage Credit will allow small businesses a maximum credit of 25 percent of the difference between the new minimum wage and what each employee was paid previously. The percentage allowed each proceeding year will decrease before it sunsets in 2026. Businesses can begin to claim the credit on their quarterly Illinois Withholding Income Tax Returns..  While this is not a long-term solution for small businesses, it will provide a measure of relief to employers as they face the hardships imposed by the minimum wage increase.

1017,"Above is an example of an election mailer with Filipino translation..  COOK COUNTY, Illinois — Cook County voters can request ballots in Filipino and Korean starting in the March 2020 primary, aside from other languages that have been available since previous elections, which are English, Spanish, Chinese and Hindi..  These two additional languages were added after the Cook County board members passed the Voting Opportunity and Translation Equity (VOTE) ordinance in October, 2019. ADVERTISEMENT.  VOTE requires the county to provide ballots in languages that have more than 13,000 speakers. There could be more language offerings in future elections..  Because of the translation of ballots into Filipino, Cook County and Chicago will be looking for bilingual Filipino-English, Korean- English election judges to help those who will be using ballots in Filipino or Korean.

Cook County Board President Tony Preckwinkle said that by passing VOTE, the county fulfills its goal of expanding language access to voters, which is part of its job..  “The core of our democracy demands that all residents have equal opportunity and access to exercise their right to vote, regardless of the language they speak, their physical ability, or their level of literacy,” said Preckwinkle..  “Cook County’s offering of Tagalog ballots is a recognition of the presence and importance of the Filipino community in the area, and access to voting is a fundamental right of U.S. citizenship,” said Ryan Villoria, board member of the Alliance of Filipinos for Immigrant Rights and Empowerment..  “I am so excited. This is a historic day for our community. The language barrier has been the biggest huddle to stop Korean Americans with limited English skills from casting their votes,” said Sik Son, president of Korean-American VOICE. “The Korean ballot will break the barrier and give the community a voice that has been silenced for a long time.”.  “Around a third of all Asian Americans in Chicagoland are limited-English proficient and experience challenges with the voting process,” said Andy Kang, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Chicago. “The VOTE Ordinance helps expand ballot access for many of these Asian American and immigrant voters.”.

1021,"Illinois’ governor does not address population loss in annual speech, barely touches on massive pension debt Posted on February 3, 2020 Recent audits show a mixed bag of some funds unfunded liability going up, others going down, but overall the funds are about 40 percent funded. (Photo courtesy: WJBC/File).  By Illinois Radio Network.  SPRINGFIELD – It’s unclear what Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s plans are to address the growing unfunded pension liabilities that a shrinking number of Illinois taxpayers are increasingly on the hook for. He barely addressed pension debt and didn’t talk about the state leading the country in population loss. Of a $40 billion budget, Illinois taxpayers put more than $9 billion in the state’s five public employees’ pension funds this fiscal year. It’ll be $10 billion next fiscal year. Funding levels are set to ramp up for several years ahead, taking resources from other taxpayer-provided services. “We’re making the payments as scheduled because if we continue to do that we’ll be funded by 2045, 90 percent,” state Sen. Robert Martwick, D-Chicago, said. Recent audits show a mixed bag of some pension systems’ unfunded liability going up, others going down, but overall the funds are about 40 percent funded. Before the governor’s State of the State Address last week, Martwick said he hoped the governor addresses the issue. “We hope to see that there’s going to be a push to really analyze that ramp and see what the solution is going forward,” Martwick said. Pritzker mentioned pension buyouts and local pension consolidation, but didn’t address the growing taxpayer cost. “We’ve also begun the long work of tackling our pension problems,” the governor said Wednesday. “In addition to expanding our state pension buyout program, in the fall veto session we … [consolidated] 650 downstate and suburban first responder pension systems. “These changes, along with our landmark pension reform that consolidated police and firefighter pensions, can make a serious dent in property taxes,” he said. After the speech. House Minority Leader Jim Durkin, R-Western Springs, said taxpayers need to see how the state plans to address the $200 billion debt. “Everybody wants to say that we can’t do anything short of changing the [state] constitution but people have stuck their heads in the sands since the [state] Supreme Court came down about five years ago and they just try to ignore the problem we have with our five pensions systems,” Durkin said. “I haven’t.” The Illinois Supreme Court in 2015 ruled against a pension reform effort saying the state cannot reduce benefits that were promised. The idea of changing the state constitution through a ballot question for voters to decide whether to allow for pension reductions isn’t considered to advance at the statehouse. Without providing details, Durkin said he plans to release statements about addressing Illinois’ pension debt sometime during this session. On pension buyouts, the architects of the programs meant to save taxpayers on growing pension costs say there are mixed results. Before the governor’s speech last week, Martwick and state Rep. Mark Batinick, R-Plainfield, said they planned to meet with the governor to talk about the performance of the pension buyouts. “Some systems have had exceptionally good performance, and some have had abysmally low performance and so we’re looking at that and trying to figure out what we can do to make those more attractive,” Martwick said. “The more people that opt into them, the more money the state saves.” The Teachers’ Retirement System, the state’s largest retirement fund, provided an update on their two buyout programs Friday. “The first is the ‘AAI’, or Accelerated Annual Increase,” said TRS Communications Director Dave Urbanek. “This is available for all retiring Tier 1 members, if they decide to accept it. In the year the program’s been available, we’ve had 4,170 members become eligible for the option. 639 members have elected to accept the AAI, which is 15.3 percent of eligible members. For all of these 639 members, they will be paid $80.8 million. That $80.8 million is, technically, the ‘savings’ to TRS, although you have to remember that the funding for both programs comes from the sale of state bonds. “The second is the ‘APB,’ or Accelerated Pension Benefit,” he said. “This is available to all Tier 1 and Tier 2 inactive members. As required by the law, we notified 14,599 eligible inactive members about the program and gave them an initial estimate of what their payment would be. The program started in the fall once we nailed down the updated number of inactive members (14,599) following the close of the books on the 2018-2019 school year. So far 814 members have accepted this buyout, or 5.6 percent of everyone who’s eligible. They will be paid $98.6 million. Again, these funds come from the sale of state bonds.” TRS’s unfunded liability grew this year by more than $3 billion, to a total of $81.1 billion. Batinick agreed the buyout programs need to be more attractive, but he said Illinois also needs to reverse the loss of population. “We’re losing high income earners, and we’re attracting lower income earners, and it’s a net loss there,” Batinick said. “When you start spreading those costs over more people, plus then there will be more Tier II people (with lower pension benefits) versus Tier I, it’s certainly a way to address the problem.” Illinois led the nation in outbound migration for the decade, something else the governor didn’t address in his State of the State speech last week.

1023,"Pritzker administration launches initiative to invest in Opportunity Zones in Illinois By MORRIS HERALD-NEWS Shaw Media file photo Caption Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, seen in this undated photo, launched initiative to invest in Opportunity Zones, including in Joliet..  As part of Governor JB Pritzker’s historic $45 billion capital program, the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) recently announced a new initiative to invest $12 million to support investment in the state’s opportunity zones..  Fifth Third Bank and the Chicago-based Decennial Group will invest nearly $15 million in Illinois’ opportunity zones..  “Supporting equitable economic growth is one of the central goals of our historic $45 billion capital plan,"" Pritzker said. ""By investing $12 million in Rebuild Illinois funds in Opportunity Zone projects, we can take advantage of this federal tax incentive to stretch our capital dollars further while creating jobs and opportunity in communities that have suffered from a lack of investment for decades."".  DCEO will invite communities, nonprofits, developers, and other stakeholders to compete for $12 million in capital grants to support projects in Opportunity Zones..  These capital grants will offer matching funds for infrastructure, utility, remediation and other site preparedness related costs for affordable housing, community development, and commercial real estate projects that will create jobs and growth..  “Pairing our Rebuild Illinois capital dollars with the incentives offered by federal Opportunity Zones allows us to achieve greater impact in underserved and economically distressed areas,” said DCEO Director Erin Guthrie..  Opportunity Zones are defined as distressed or economically underserved areas census tracts. Certain types of investments made in opportunity zones that meet specific criteria stand to receive favorable capital gains tax benefits at both the federal and state levels..  Illinois designated 327 Opportunity Zones in 2018, including sites in Joliet, Pontiac, and Kankakee..  In scoring grant applications, DCEO will consider criteria such as job creation, community support, project readiness and viability, the availability of matching financing, alignment of the project with the Governor’s 5-Year Economic Plan, and ability of the project to have a positive economic impact in communities of need.

1029,"Ratings: +20,143 / 3,724 / -385 The Chicago man known as the “Dreadhead Cowboy” is facing charges after he rode his horse onto the Dan Ryan Expressway Monday, and his actions have inspired strong reactions on both sides in that ride’s aftermath. Adam Hollingsworth, who has achieved notoriety for riding his horse at protests this year and as part of a campaign to improve census participation that was launched by Mayor Lori Lightfoot, rode his horse onto the highway in a slow-speed chase during rush hour Monday, drawing a crowd of motorcycles and other vehicles as he made his way down the highway. Hollingsworth indicated that his ride was designed to draw attention to the children being hurt by violence in the city. “Kids’ lives matter!” Hollingsworth, who broadcast part of his ride on social media, said. Traffic was backed up as a result of the ride, with Illinois State Police ultimately convincing him to exit the interstate at 95th Street. He was taken into custody by authorities, and now faces several charges in connection with the incident. Now, his friends are voicing their support for his actions. “He felt like it was necessary to make a big scene,” Joshua Hatchett, a friend of Hollingsworth, said. “Sometimes you gotta create a little ruckus to get your voice across.” Eugene Burnett, one of the motorcyclists who rode alongside Hollingsworth, also supported his actions. “We don’t harm or bother anybody,” he said. “Don’t get in the way. Do something for the kids!” The “cowboy’s"" actions didn’t win universal acclaim by any stretch. A large number of social media comments quickly focused on the way Hollingsworth was cantering his horse for miles on the pavement of the interstate. Illinois State Police say the animal was bleeding from one of its front hooves when it was given to Chicago Animal Care and Control officers, and suffered an injury to another hoof during the ride. Mayor Lightfoot, who dubbed Hollingsworth the “Census Cowboy” during an event earlier this year, was also critical of the ride, describing it as a “stunt” that endangered the horse and those on the highway. “There is a right way and a wrong way to call attention to issues of great importance, and this stunt was decidedly the very wrong way,” she said. Needless to say, the debate will continue to rage on after the incident, but the “Dreadhead Cowboy’s” supporters are still behind him. “It was a peaceful protest. We weren’t breaking into stores,” Burnett said. “We’re trying to give back to the neighborhood and to change people’s minds.”","[0.5467715263366699, 0.4532284736633301]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5467715263366699

Adam Hollingsworth, 33, was escorted by a group of motorcyclists as he rode southbound lanes of the expressway, sometimes at a gallop, for several miles. On a ""social media"" Live feed while he was riding, Hollingsworth said he wanted everyone to know kids lives matter. 'Until kids' lives matter, nothing else matters,' he said.

Previously, Hollingsworth was facing charges for Reckless Conduct, Disobeying a Police Officer, Criminal Trespass to State-Supported Property, Obstruction of Traffic, and operating a non-highway-vehicle on a highway..  The incident occurred Monday afternoon when Hollingsworth rode his horse onto the Dan Ryan Expressway just after 4 p.m. He conducted a Facebook Live broadcast while on the highway, shouting “kids lives matter” as he rode the horse along the expressway. He was flanked by numerous motorcycles and other vehicles, and traffic was backed up as a result of the incident..  Eventually he exited the highway at 95 th Street, and he was taken into custody by Illinois State Police. The man dubbed the ""Census Cowboy"" took his horse down Chicago's Dan Ryan Expressway Monday afternoon during rush hour..  The horse Hollingsworth was riding was placed into the custody of Chicago Animal Care and Control. Officials say the horse suffered a bloody wound on one of its hooves, and appeared to have sores on its sides from its saddle..  A day after the incident, the felony animal cruelty charges have been approved by the State’s Attorney’s Office.

1047,"It’s no secret that much of rural Illinois, the vast region of Illinois outside of Chicago and the collar counties, feels forgotten by Chicago Democrats running Illinois when it comes to things like state spending priorities..  We see these arguments play out every day at gas stations, coffee shops and at nearly any gathering of rural residents throughout our state. If you live in rural Illinois, you probably even talked about it more than you’d care to admit this holiday season..  However, there is one area of life in which nearly nobody in rural Illinois feels forgotten — taxation and fees. With well over $1.4 billion in new taxes and fees taking effect with the new year, rural residents are far from immune from the disproportionate effects of these revenue-extraction schemes on their small towns, farms and, frankly, their resolve to remain in Illinois..  A new trade-in tax aimed at used vehicles results in double-taxation for many Illinoisans, whether their vehicle was purchased in-state or out-of-state. Hugely increased license plates fees for automobiles and higher motor fuel taxes certainly have a disproportionate effect on areas lesser served by mass transit and where commutes are longer due to employment and medical care availability..  Recreation activities enjoyed by many more people in rural areas than urban include boating, fishing and use of ATVs; boat and trailer owners are finding more taxes and fees increasingly hostile to their ability to enjoy the activities afforded them in rural Illinois. With fewer brick-and-mortar businesses in rural Illinois than in the Chicago area, new online sales tax increases ensure rural residents bear additional brunt of the tax burden for their “inconvenience” of shopping online for items unavailable nearby..  The increased taxes on all Illinoisans ⁠— rural, suburban and urban⁠— are being spent with very unequal input from stakeholders paying the bill for this excess. This is largely due to gerrymandered legislative maps and the disproportionate power structures they engender..  In the new year, we will see new debates on many new issues. Perhaps it’s long past time that supermajority Democrats, capable of passing whatever they want on their own with no Republican support, finally pass a Fair Map Amendment and finally address Illinois’ high property taxes..  Neither of these two issues contradict any progressive social stances of the governor and his supermajority party but would give many hardworking Illinoisans some hope to keep up their resolve and stay in Illinois a little while longer. After all, you’ll need them to continue paying those higher taxes and fees Democrats presented in their stockings this year..  These taxes and fees are a lot of straws to throw on the camels’ backs all at once, so I’m not surprised to hear so many backs breaking by the actions of this state they once loved. With Illinois tops in the nation in population loss, isn’t it time to try something new in 2020? After all, there is no way to extract further taxes out of the growing liege of Illinois’ expatriates..

Demographers say it’s likely Illinois will lose one U.S. congressman, if not two, come the next reapportionment..  Illinois had 25 congressional districts in 1948, but lost a seat after the 1950 census. Today, there are 18 congressional seats. Illinois lost it’s 19th congressional seat in 2013 after the 2010 reapportionment. The next reapportionment will occur after the 2020 Census and before the 2022 elections..  If Illinois loses more congressional representation because it’s bleeding population to other states, U.S. Rep.

1052,"State saw largest population loss in nation across decade BY RACHEL RODGERS rrodgers@saukvalley.com 815-632-2538 | @rj_rodgers 9:21 pm.  Illinois lost more residents than any other state during the past decade, and 2019 census data shows a sixth straight year of population loss..  The state population dropped by 51,250 people in 2019, according to new estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau, and has decreased about 159,700 people since 2010. Because of outmigration, it lost its spot in 2017 as the fifth-biggest state..  The population picture is much the same locally..  All counties in the Sauk Valley also have been in decline, with most seeing a steady drop in people for the past 2 decades..  Whiteside County showed the biggest loss since 2010, decreasing by 2,868 residents, or nearly 5 percent of the population, from 58,494 to 55,626..  Ogle County saw a drop of 2,574 people, Bureau County fell by 1,987, Lee County lost 1,808, and Carroll County decreased by 1,079 people, according to census data..  Dan Payette, executive director of the Blackhawk Hills Regional Council, recently talked about population loss to different governing bodies in the area while presenting the 5-year Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy for the six-county region..  He told the Dixon City Council in December that the downward population trend is likely to continue, and communities need to work together and focus on marketing themselves as a region to promote more growth..

1053,"State saw largest population loss in nation across decade BY RACHEL RODGERS rrodgers@saukvalley.com 815-632-2538 | @rj_rodgers 9:21 pm.  Illinois lost more residents than any other state during the past decade, and 2019 census data shows a sixth straight year of population loss..  The state population dropped by 51,250 people in 2019, according to new estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau, and has decreased about 159,700 people since 2010. Because of outmigration, it lost its spot in 2017 as the fifth-biggest state..  The population picture is much the same locally..  All counties in the Sauk Valley also have been in decline, with most seeing a steady drop in people for the past 2 decades..  Whiteside County showed the biggest loss since 2010, decreasing by 2,868 residents, or nearly 5 percent of the population, from 58,494 to 55,626..  Ogle County saw a drop of 2,574 people, Bureau County fell by 1,987, Lee County lost 1,808, and Carroll County decreased by 1,079 people, according to census data..  Dan Payette, executive director of the Blackhawk Hills Regional Council, recently talked about population loss to different governing bodies in the area while presenting the 5-year Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy for the six-county region..  He told the Dixon City Council in December that the downward population trend is likely to continue, and communities need to work together and focus on marketing themselves as a region to promote more growth..

1054,"Looking for work? How about a job that will pay close to $30 an hour? No experience needed..  The U.S. Census Bureau is hiring thousands of people in the Chicago area to make sure everyone is counted..  Morning Insider Lauren Victory takes us inside the job of a census taker..  More than 100,000 workers are still needed in our section of the country to collect data for the 2020 U.S. Census..  “We have to count over 54 million people over eight states, in 24 million households,” said Marilyn Sanders, Chicago Regional Director for the U.S. Census Bureau..  Sanders is undaunted by that task. This will be her fifth go-around involved in the constitutionally mandated count..  “Only job I’ve ever had,” she said..  Recruiting employees is one of her top priorities right now as head of the Chicago region’s 32 offices. She’s in charge of 387,000 Census workers stretching from Minnesota to Arkansas..  “We’re at about 70 percent,” she said..  The clock is ticking to fill positions. By mid-May, census takers will need to hit the streets..  “Starting out their day, they will be provided – on an iPad or an iPhone – a list of addresses that have not responded to the census,” she said. “A census taker will be given an assignment based on their availability.”.  Hourly rates paid to census takers increased from the 2010 Census, because of unemployment..  “The pay rates within the city of Chicago is $29.50 an hour,” Sanders said. “Having the pay rates that are competitive to other types of positions such as this is one of the opportunities we had to make certain we could have the number of people we needed.”.  Census takers also will be reimbursed for expenses such as mileage..  The Census Bureau also is trying to appeal to people’s sense of civic duty, with a YouTube video touting the need to “make sure every voice is heard.”.  “Together, we can shape our future,” the video’s narrator states..

1055,"Gov. J.B. Pritzker sent out one of the most popular tweets of his term following Iowa’s caucus debacle Monday night, calling for Illinois to replace the Hawkeye State in holding the nation’s first presidential primary elections in 2024..  Illinois has some work to do before taking that torch..  After all, the Illinois Secretary of State’s office is scrambling to explain how hundreds of people who identified themselves as non-U.S. citizens ended up on the voter rolls , how thousands of ineligible 16-year-olds had their information sent to election officials, and how hundreds of formerly incarcerated Illinoisans had their voter registrations mistakenly canceled ..  Beyond that, Iowa remains the electoral envy of Illinois on at least one important measure: fair maps..  House Speaker Mike Madigan first rose to the speakership in 1983 through his mapmaking prowess, and has used the power of that pen to reward allies and punish enemies for three of the last four decades..  That doesn’t happen in Iowa..  In fact, Madigan’s former chief of staff Tim Mapes went toe-to-toe with Iowa’s Senate president in a mapmaking debate four years ago . The two in 2016 spoke on a panel in Chicago sponsored by the National Council of State Legislatures..  “Legislators like to be involved in this state on how they frame their districts. Whether they like all of it is another thing,” Mapes said. “But they like to be involved, and it’s still a big part of what we do.”.  Meanwhile, Iowa has an independent commission draw the state’s legislative map every decade..  “The legislature has absolutely nothing to say about how these lines are drawn. Just ‘yay’ or ‘nay,’” said former Iowa Senate President Pam Jochum, a Democrat. She boasted that Iowa’s maps have not been challenged in court since 1970..  “Senator, great ideas for Iowa,” Mapes responded. “But they’re a little different in Illinois.”.  Mapes has since been ousted from Madigan’s office amid allegations of sexual harassment..  Pritzker ran on ending Mapes’ flippant retort..  During his gubernatorial campaign, he told Springfield political blogger Rich Miller that he would veto any map “that is in any way drafted or created by legislators, political party leaders and/or their staffs or allies.” He also said Illinois should amend the constitution to create an independent commission to draw political maps following the 2020 census..  The governor is now going back on that promise. He didn’t mention maps at all in his recent State of the State address. And when asked about it, he pledged only to “veto any unfair map that gets presented to me.” That leaves a world of daylight for Madigan shenanigans..  The most popular effort in the General Assembly to establish fair maps – a bipartisan constitutional amendment filed by Democratic state Sen. Julie Morrison – has not received Pritzker’s blessing..  Some political insiders have pushed back on independent mapmaking for what they claim are pragmatic reasons, noting that on some measures Illinois gerrymandering is not as extreme as it is in other states..  But purely mathematical measures of mapmaking don’t account for the problem at hand: the power of political leaders to favor some lawmakers and punish others through boundary lines, or the perception of such power..  Fair maps would chip away at this privilege for the state’s most powerful politicians..  Another pushback is that Pritzker shouldn’t put a redistricting constitutional amendment on the ballot in November, as it may muddy the waters for his progressive income tax hike referendum..  Of course, Illinois voters would love an opportunity to support fair maps at the ballot box. But instead of a constitutional amendment, Pritzker could instead ask the General Assembly to simply pass a statute establishing an independent map commission. That commission would draw a map on which lawmakers would vote up or down. No constitutional amendment required..  That’s what Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is poised to do. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel infamously drew one hostile alderman’s home out of his ward after the 2010 census. Since taking office, Lightfoot has pushed for an independent citizens' commission to redraw Chicago's 50-ward map..  At the state level, former Democratic state Sen. Martin Sandoval first took his seat in Springfield thanks to the remap following the 2000 census and Madigan’s political clout . The speaker was seeking support from Hispanic political leaders for his daughter’s run for Illinois attorney general, so he ensured Sandoval faced no opponents in the 2002 Democratic primary for the newly drawn 12th Senate district on Chicago’s Southwest Side..  On Jan. 28, Sandoval pleaded guilty on federal charges of bribery and tax fraud, and faces up to 13 years in prison..  Illinois might be looking down its nose at Iowa this week.

Every 10 years, the Census gives communities the chance to receive the funding they need. Sunday's ride is 13 miles long, and runs through Chicago, Oak Park, Forest Park and Maywood. Lyft provided a limited number of free Divvy bikes for the event, too.Ford wants to remind residents how important it is to complete the census and be counted. He is especially trying to target the communities he serves, which have low census responses.""If census matters in terms of dollars, and we say we are not getting our fair share, then let's go out and count the ones that are not being counted so we can get the dollars for our community,"" Alderman Emma Mitts said.This was supposed to be the last weekend to push for the census, but a federal court permitted census response to continue into October. The Trump Administration is appealing that decision.The ride begins at 9 a.m. Learn more at eventbrite.com .Chicago police also planned to pedal along to keep everyone safe.","[0.5287262201309204, 0.4712737798690796]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5287262201309204

1069,"Three cheers for the Democrats who are fighting mad about how some states have gerrymandered their legislative districts..  The National Democratic Redistricting Committee is making a big stink about gerrymandering, the undemocratic and unfair practice of drawing legislative district lines to gain a nearly insurmountable advantage over opposition candidates ""The political system is broken. The fight to fix it is now,"" declares a fundraising email, asking support for its campaign "" targeting 13 states during the 2019-2020 election cycle, including 3 gubernatorial races, 17 state legislative chambers, and one down-ballot race."" Wow, I thought. Finally, some bi-partisan support for efforts to reform Illinois congressional and legislative districting, a system that has skewed the map into laughably ""compact"" and ""contiguous"" fiefdoms. In Illinois, gerrymandering so solidly guarantees that incumbent and and politically subservient candidates are elected that sometimes no one runs against them. Efforts to reform the corrupt system have been stymied by the very lawmakers who benefit from gerrymandering. So, I went through the committee's list of endorsed candidates, to perhaps in some small way give them a boost in the coming election. Except for this: There are no Illinois Democratic candidates on the list. Not a single Democrat is willing to stand with the group's chairman, Eric H. Holder, former attorney general in the Obama administration in making the pledge :.  For too long, partisan gerrymandering has been used as a tool to manipulate electoral districts to benefit political parties instead of the voters..  I believe every elected official should be accountable to the people they represent, which means we need to end gerrymandering..  I pledge to support fair redistricting that ends map manipulation and creates truly representative districts. Obviously, the group is interested only in stamping out gerrymandering when it's done by Republicans. The group has twisted a meritorious campaign into a partisan assault. (If it's not clear, I oppose gerrymandering conducted by either Republicans or Democrats.) NDRC allies itself, as do I, with liberal Supreme C0urt Justice Elena Kagan who dissented from a high court decision that held partisan gerrymandering is a political issue not to be decided by the courts. In a dissent, Kagan correctly warned that partisan gerrymandering allows politicians to entrench themselves in office and could “irreparably damage our system of government.” She said. ""Voters should choose their own representatives, not the other way around."".  Indeed..  But not in Illinois, where Mike Madigan, the House speaker who runs the state with an iron hand and the chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party, controls the redistricting process. Not a single Illinois Democrat to my knowledge has the guts to stand alongside the national party leaders who agree with Holder that, ""The biggest rigged system in America is gerrymandering."".  How interesting that the current Democratic screed is about how ""democracy is in danger"" as never before because of the autocratic President Donald Trump and his nomination of Appellate Court Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Any Illinois Democratic who now takes up that warning about how democracy is in danger while ignoring the mess that gerrymandering has created in Illinois is a shameless hypocrite..  After the completion of the current census, redistricinting will become another hot issue in Illinois. And voters who want to do right by themselves and other Illinoisans should ask the legislative candidates where they stand on the issue.","[0.5581102967262268, 0.4418897330760956]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5581102967262268

1073,"Reprints Print Bloomberg.  In two new reports Chicago ranks as one of the nation’s most lackluster housing markets. Local experts say the area is unlikely to show any sizzle before some of the region’s well-known financial problems start to improve..  “Until we start to address the pension funds and spending issues, we’re going to continue to see weakness in the housing market,” said Jennifer Ames, a longtime top-selling broker in the city who heads the Chicago office of Engel & Volkers. “It’s not a new story.”.  The state’s $133.5 billion unfunded pension obligation hangs in the air, and with it the threat of big tax increases designed to plug the gap. That creates uncertainty about households’ future cost of homeownership..  “That type of uncertainty, not knowing how much taxes will change, has an effect,” said Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University..  Meanwhile, 2020 promises to be “more of the same steady, boring housing market” in Chicago, Smith said..  That’s a slightly more positive outlook than the economists at realtor.com, which this morning released its 2020 forecast for 100 metro areas in the U.S. For the Chicago area, the forecast shows very slight dips on both the market attributes it covers, predicting the number of sales will be down 0.9 percent and home prices will dip 0.3 percent. That’s essentially flat..  Chicago is one of 17 metro areas where the forecast is for both attributes to dip. Realtor.com doesn’t rank the 100 metros anymore (when it did, Chicago was No. 100 twice) , but 14 of the 17 are forecast to slip more deeply than Chicago..  Nationwide, realtor.com forecasts a sales decline of 1.8 percent and prices rising by 0.8 percent, all in all a meager year. Even the highest-flying market out of 100 isn’t looking at a frothy market. That’s Tucson, Ariz., where realtor.com forecasts sales increasing by 3.4 percent and prices by 3.3 percent..  In its report, realtor.com attributes next year’s lackluster real estate market to uncertainty about the U.S. economy putting a damper on both buyers’ and sellers’ outlooks and on shortages in the supply of both new and existing homes..  The other report, which looks at home price growth over the past four quarters, shows that Chicago ranks 95th of 100 metro areas. According to the late-November report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Chicago-area home prices grew by 1.6 percent over the course of the past year..  At the opposite end of the list, the metro areas with the biggest price growth were Boise City, Idaho, at 11.1 percent, and Tucson, at 10.3 percent..  Slim price growth is good news for buyers, who don’t see homes becoming less affordable too fast, but not as good for existing homeowners and sellers who may be hoping to maximize their investment and perhaps finally come up from underwater so they can afford to sell..  Both reports deal in broad strokes across entire metro areas, and in doing so they obscure the differences in submarkets within the Chicago area..  “Look at the West Loop,” said veteran agent Janet Owen, with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices KoenigRubloff Realty Group. “They have so much sales activity and they’re having bidding wars.”.  Smith of DePaul said a metrowide picture of the real estate market gets warped by the continuing shift of tastes from suburban to urban. According to the American Community Survey, an arm of the U.S. Census, the number of owner-occupied households in suburban Cook County dropped by about 19,000 in the years 2012-2017, while the city figure grew by nearly as much, 16,730. The shift, Smith said, contributes to the drop-off in demand and concomitant drop in sale prices on suburban homes. Letter to the Editor.  Have something to get off your chest?

1079,"Illinois is a step closer to phasing out the use of cancer-causing ethylene oxide, but business lobbyists are rallying to block the legislation from reaching Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s desk before the General Assembly’s fall session adjourns..  On a 60-47 vote , the Illinois House advanced a bill to the Senate that would require Northfield-based Medline Industries to move an assembly plant away from densely populated Lake County neighborhoods or switch to safer alternatives for sterilizing medical equipment by the end of next year..  Advertisement House Bill 3888, which Pritzker has vowed to sign, also would force a handful of the state’s chemical manufacturers to dramatically reduce emissions of the toxic chemical and nudge hospitals to stop using ethylene oxide by 2023..  Sponsored by Rep. Rita Mayfield, D-Waukegan, the measure is the latest response to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report that found ethylene oxide pollution is responsible for alarmingly high cancer risks in four predominantly Latino and African American census tracts surrounding Medline’s plant off Skokie Highway and Pulaski Drive in southwest Waukegan..  The Chicago Tribune first reported in November that Medline was the third-largest source of ethylene oxide in Illinois in 2014, the last year for which comprehensive figures are available, trailing only Vantage Specialty Chemicals in nearby Gurnee and the now-shuttered Sterigenics facility in west suburban Willowbrook ..  While there was a bipartisan push to force Sterigenics to close in DuPage County, most House Republicans voted against Mayfield’s measure to address similar concerns in Lake County. Rep. Jim Durkin, a Western Springs Republican and the House minority leader, voted present..  Medline has agreed to overhaul its Waukegan plant and limit its annual emissions to 150 pounds, down from 3,058 pounds reported by the company in 2014. But community groups contend that any additional ethylene oxide released close to homes and schools increases the cumulative risk of developing cancer..  “We need to call and email like never before to make sure our voices are heard by each and every senator,” the Stop EtO in Lake County group wrote in a Facebook post after the House vote..  Medline contends it needs to use ethylene oxide because it is a proven, government-approved method to sterilize medical equipment, in particular surgical kits that contain several types of materials, some of which can be damaged by alternatives such as steam or radiation..

(WTHI) - The Census was one of the many entities affected by COVID-19, but operations have began to pick back up again in both Indiana and Illinois..

News 10 visited Clark County, Illinois to see how Wabash Valley communities in the Land of Lincoln have adapted and what the update is..

That time has now passed, and census operations in Illinois are picking back up..  LeFever says workers are gradually going door to door to continue counting. He says they are hanging tags, aren’t going inside homes, and wearing masks..  Marshall’s public library and the Clark County health department are open for people to come and get help with submitting census forms..  He says one change through all of this is the Census Bureau is able to find workers much easier now since so many are out of work. Other than that, he believes the effects felt in Clark County will be minimal..  “The Census has actually gone pretty well here as far as self-response is concerned,” LeFever said, “Now they have to go out for the people who just won’t do it until you go to the door. There’s always those people who will just not do it. So you have to go out and find them and count them.”.  News 10 investigated how Indiana is doing also, and, more specifically, the surrounding Wabash Valley communities. Executive Director of the West Central Indiana Economic Development District Ryan Keller says while COVID-19 has had an impact, they’re getting right back on track with the Census..  Keller says Census operations did stop in March due to COVID-19 and didn’t pick back up until late May. They have since resumed, and Keller says they are going strong..  Over the past couple of weeks, workers have been going door to door to continue counting.That deadline has been extended through October. The deadline to fill out your Census form online was also extended to October 31st..  Keller says self-response numbers have been pretty good given the circumstances. The highest in our area is Clay County at 63%, while Parke County is the lowest at a 52% self-response rate. Vigo County is right in the middle with just over 60%..  “If COVID-19 hadn’t happened, those rates right there are a little low,” Keller said, “However, due to COVID-19, all operations ceasing, and everybody’s focus was shifted to the pandemic—I would say we are still in a really good spot for completion.”.  Keller says the number one goal is just to get people counted. It doesn’t take a lot of effort, and it will result in a lot of funding for this area..  Another point he made is with unemployment up, the Census creates a job opportunity for you at home. Keller says there’s still time to apply. All you have to do is visit 2020census.gov.

1084,"Community members joined a protest organized by the Southern Illinois Peace Coalition on Saturday to speak out against racism and militarized policing. Gallery | 4 Photos Ana Luiza Jacome/@aluizaphotography Brittany Scott, 30, rallying for the Black Lives Matter movement at the Peace and Justice monthly vigil held by the Peace Coalition of Southern Illinois, Saturday, June 6, 2020, Carbondale, ILL..  The protest, held at Carbondale’s town square, followed demonstrations held across the country and the globe in the wake of the death of George Floyd..  Around 40 demonstrators held signs on the sidewalk at the intersection of Illinois Route 51 and Route 13 as hundreds of cars drove by, some honking, waving and cheering in support..  Advertisement.  Georgeann Hartzog, a member of the peace coalition, said the organization’s vigil was to “Reject Racism and Militarized Policing: Seek Equity and Justice,” as well as advertise for the Poor People’s Campaign, which was originally started in 1968 by civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..  “We’ve been working on issues of militarism, justice, human rights, foreign policy for all these many years now,” Hartzog said. “With this continuation of violence against black bodies by people we’re paying, and people we’re paying well to do it, I think people are finally starting to see,” Hartzog said..  Hartzog said she believes the death of George Floyd has shaken people..  Jyotsna Kapur, a member of the peace coalition for nearly 20 years and an SIU professor of cinema and photography, said she believes it is important for the community to stand with its Black members..  “I think the country is in turmoil, […] and I think our Black friends, neighbors, colleagues, are feeling a lot of anger, pain, and hurt, and it’s important that we come and stand with them and show them that [they’re] not isolated and that we hear you, we see you,” Kapur said..  Kapur said she believes spending on the military and police should be reprioritized towards institutions such as health and education..  “We need people in the community to take care of each other, to protect and serve as the police say, but I don’t think an armed group of people who identify so strongly with their institution rather than with citizens, is the way to go,” Kapur said. “We need to reprioritize. I think this pandemic has shown how important it is for all around the world to reprioritize, to back off from the military expense.”.  Linda Flowers, president of the Carbondale chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was seated with a small table at the demonstration to help register individuals to vote..  Flowers stressed the importance of voting, saying that “unless all of this concern, all of these protests result in action, it doesn’t matter.”.  Flowers said the Carbondale chapter of the NAACP has been helping with voter registration as well as encouraging and educating community members on the importance of participating in the 2020 census..  One way Flowers said the community can see change for the better is if citizens continue to speak up..  “If this crowd, the crowd yesterday, go to city council meetings and encourage and demand some changes like that, then it would be for the positive work out for the citizens of the community,” Flowers said..  Flowers said she is encouraged to see young people speaking up in the community..  “I heard someone say, people of my generation are not out here today because we’re in that vulnerable population with some underlying medical conditions, so to see the young people concerned enough to organize that very successful protest done yesterday, I’m encouraged,” Flowers said..  Brittany Scott, a recent SIU social work graduate who held a sign that said “Black Lives Matter,” said she believes in higher education for police..  “I’m really here to say that I really think that a positive change as far as higher education [goes] is needed for the police,” Scott said. “And just learn how to work with people and understand where they’re coming from and approach [them] different.”.  Scott said seeing others in the community start to open their eyes and care more empowers her to get out and join as well..  Scott said a way to see change in social justice is to be “invested in those [disadvantaged] communities, and try to make it more equal, acknowledging that there aren’t a lot of the same opportunities or those opportunities are overlooked, even if you have the same qualifications.”.  Tyler Knupp, who studies computer science at SIU said he recognizes that not all feel safe in the presence of police..  “To be comfortable around a police presence is also a privilege, and people need to realize that not everyone feels safe around police because of all the brutality that happens just on the basis of being black or non-white,” Knupp said. “Freedom means nothing until everyone can feel safe in their own homes.”.  Zynn Moore, who studies languages, cultures and international trade at SIU said he was at the protest in solidarity with the Black community..  “Personally, I’m here in solidarity, because, as a queer Jewish person, I recognize the status of black people in this country and that they’re disadvantaged and that people are actually dying and it needs to stop,” Moore said..  Both Moore and Knupp said they wish to see actual political change arise from protesting..  Sports reporter Brooke Buerck can be reached at at @bbuerck25..

Population drops allow lawmakers, particularly those in the majority party of a state, to redraw congressional district maps in a process called redistricting.

U.S. Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García contended the timing of the initiative was intended to “instill fear” in immigrants not just about deportation but about participating in the 2020 census. Advertisement.  “The timing is no accident,” García said at a news conference Tuesday. “The attempted intimidation has a clear purpose: It is to intimidate our neighbors who are Latino, African American, Asian American communities in particular, not to open their doors. Trump succeeds if we do that. Trump wants us to be undercounted in our communities so that we would lose federal resources and services that are vital to our communities and weaken our political power.”.  Households across the country will start to receive mail by March 12 from the U.S. Census Bureau with instructions on how to fill out the questionnaire by phone, mail or internet . Workers hired by the federal agency will start visiting households that haven’t responded on their own by April, according to the bureau. In Chicago, community organizations have already started knocking on doors , trying to inform residents about the decennial count and to figure out how many people need help filling out the questionnaire..  Outreach groups doing work around the 2020 census had already expressed concern about the willingness of immigrants to participate because of Trump’s attempt to include a citizenship question. The questionnaire will not ask anyone about their immigration status.

The new enforcement tactic and the response by local officials marked an escalation of the long-running conflict between the Trump administration and leaders of cities like Chicago, where state and local laws prohibit police from assisting in immigration enforcement or from stopping anyone because of their immigration status..  “We will not be bullied, period, especially by a bully like President Trump who trades in hatred and scare tactics,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a video she released following news last week about the new enforcement effort. “To all our neighbors and friends, I want you to know that Chicago stands with you and will always fight to keep you safe. We are a welcoming city and proud of it, and no amount of vitriol will make us think otherwise.”.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials told The New York Times last week that the agency will divert 100 officers to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in cities around the country “in order to enhance the integrity of the immigration system, protect public safety, and strengthen our national security.”.  In Chicago, ICE officials previously said arrests are down in the area because state and local officials are no longer cooperating with them . An ICE official earlier this year said the agency no longer has access to databases in Illinois that it previously used to track noncitizens, and local jails denied more than 1,000 detainers the agency issued during fiscal 2019..  Federal officials have also argued that the lack of cooperation has led to a greater public risk, leading to collateral arrests or costing residents more if the person gets arrested again. [Most read] Column: Blagojevich commutation shows Trump is assembling a Corruption Dream Team » But García described the administration’s latest move as a “radical departure” for U.S. Customs and Border Protection..  Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said the fear of ICE has already deterred victims of violent crime from showing up in court out of fear that immigration enforcement officers could be waiting for them outside the courthouse..  Foxx said that’s why her office joined the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights in suing the Trump administration over the “public charge” rule, which could deny green cards to immigrants in the country legally who receive a form of public aid..  While the U.S. Supreme Court in January allowed the Trump administration to move forward with the new rule, an injunction in Illinois remains in effect. The county’s federal lawsuit is still pending as of this week..  “Our office will be going to the Supreme Court once again to fight to make sure that these racist policies don’t take hold,” Foxx said at the news conference..  At the state level, advocates are pushing for legislators to pass a bill that would further prevent local officials from cooperating with ICE, said Mony Ruiz-Velasco, executive director of the PASO West Suburban Action Project Advertisement.  As they did last year when Trump warned of a crackdown on those without legal residency, immigrant advocates are also promoting a know-your-rights campaign, advising people not to open their doors or speak to federal agents, to have a safety plan in place and to ask during a traffic stop if the officer is local or federal.

1095,"They decry Trump's plan to send 100 border agents to sanctuary cities and warn that it could depress the immigrants' count in the 2020 census. SHOW TRANSCRIPT.  ""The state's attorney's office does not cooperate or engage with ICE. We did not then; we do not now."".  Elected officials and immigrant advocates in Chicago are voicing their opposition to the Trump administration's latest crackdown on sanctuary cities. These are localities that refuse to help ICE identify and arrest undocumented immigrants..  Border Patrol is sending 100 officers — including elite tactical units known as BORTAC — to help ICE conduct arrests in the country's interior. BORTAC agents typically conduct high-risk missions against cartels and human traffickers along the border. But from February through May, some BORTAC agents will be deployed in sanctuary cities nationwide, including in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago..  Advocates are calling the move an intimidation tactic whose ""chilling effect"" could repress the count of immigrants in the 2020 census. Households around the country will start receiving census documents in less than a month.  ""This is a smokescreen by the president to seek to further intimidate, punish and prevent people from participating in the census. By the same token, it begs the question of what will 100 agents do nationally in 10 cities across the country."".  Local officials say they haven't noticed ramped-up ICE presence in Chicago yet. An ICE spokesperson tells Newsy the border agents would only be ""extra boots on the ground."" He added: ""These are still ICE-led operations. We're not going to change our tactics or escalate our use of force."" On top of that, ICE's acting director says it's using the agents ""to supplement enforcement activity in response to the resource challenges stemming from sanctuary city policies."".  ""To the lawmakers who support non-cooperation with ICE, please reconsider your position so that we can jointly prevent dangerous individuals like murderers, gang members, rapists, pedophiles, drug dealers and domestic abusers from being released back into our communities who are in violation of federal immigration law."".  The city of Chicago prevents local police from cooperating with ICE unless the targeted individuals have pending or prior felony convictions, an outstanding criminal warrant or have been certified as a gang member. And the state of Illinois forbids counties from transferring undocumented people they jail to ICE custody unless ICE presents a judicial warrant. ICE says these policies greatly hurt agents' abilities to do their job, hence the need for additional resources..  But Chicago officials say cooperating with ICE would undermine the trust of immigrant communities and thereby make their cities less safe..  ""When victims and witnesses are afraid to come to court because they believe that there's the potential for ICE agents to scoop them and tear them from their families, then they simply stop participating.""","[0.8411697745323181, 0.1588301658630371]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.8411697745323181

CHICAGO — For the past five years, household incomes in Chicago have been on the rise, and fewer people have been experiencing extreme economic hardship. Yet even as the needle edges slightly forward, 22 percent of Chicagoans still live in conditions of poverty, according to census data..  In a new initiative set to launch Thursday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot will take on an approach to poverty in Chicago that doesn’t shy away from Chicago’s generational, systemic and racial causes of hardship. The plan to end poverty in a generation will be unveiled at the Solutions Toward Ending Poverty (STOP) Summit Thursday at the Isadore and Sadie Dorin Forum, 25 W. Roosevelt Road..  The summit will bring together policymakers, artists, employers, nonprofit and neighborhood leaders to examine what it means to be in poverty and to analyze the history of how the city got to where it is today. From there, leaders will begin to develop a coordinated agenda for reducing and eventually eliminating poverty in Chicago..  Though Thursday’s summit on the University of Illinois at Chicago campus is invitation-only, the event aims to be a starting point for the program, with ongoing engagement planned in other parts of the city..  About 22 percent of Chicagoans fall below the Federal Poverty Level, which is an annual income of $26,200 for a family of four, according to federal guidelines..  But the story told by poverty statistics and the people trapped inside its grip is an incomplete one. Rather, poverty in Chicago is entrenched in a racialized history of the city’s businesses, policies, justice system and social infrastructure..  “We did this historically by using government as a tool to create and enforce race-based discrimination that killed, crushed, and systematically reduced the lives of too many over generations,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said at a Friday press conference in a pledge to erase generational poverty ..  RELATED: ‘Poverty Is Killing Us — All Of Us’: Lightfoot Pledges To End Generational Poverty.  After the summit, the city will spearhead a cross-sector movement designed to bridge the silos between the work already being done to address poverty, and to engage communities most impacted by economic hardship to drive forward solutions..  Those solutions won’t only be policy-driven ones, said Dan Lurie, Lightfoot’s policy director who is taking the lead on the mayor’s poverty agenda..  “This is a big, longterm effort to reposition how government is going to be partnering with and benefiting communities, and ultimately that all towards a very different version of economic growth,” Lurie said..  Lurie said the push to end poverty will be designed to “meet people where they are,” taking things a step further than the common-sense policy changes that the mayor’s office is already making headway on, like raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2020 and ending the practice of taking people’s driver’s licenses for nonmoving violations. That will also mean sitting down with folks across the city, in particular places like the West Side, “where mayor’s offices have not engaged in the past at this level,” Lurie said..  RELATED: Here’s How To Get Your Driver’s License Reinstated In Illinois (It’s Happening Soon).  “We want to really figure this out in partnership with residents, in partnership with people on the ground doing this work who are helping, these nonprofits, the social service agencies, leaders, advocates, artists. People who understand how Chicago works, and have never really had a chance to engage with the city to decide what the collective here could be,” Lurie said..  The summit itself will feature a series of panels, breakout sessions and a keynote address from Dr. Michael McAfee, the head of economic and social equity think tank Policy Link. The first panel, moderated by UIC history professor and Elizabeth Todd-Breland, will take stock of Chicago’s unique history and how it shaped the state of poverty in the city today. A second panel, moderated by the Urban Institute’s Chief Innovation Officer Erika Poethig, will examine policy agendas for addressing poverty that have been successful in cities across the country..  A closing session of the summit will feature Lightfoot in a candid conversation about the legacy of poverty in Chicago with Darryl Holliday, editorial director of civic media lab City Bureau..

YORKVILLE – Kendall County is among the top most responsive counties for the 2020 U.S. Census within Illinois, according to county officials and U.S. Census Bureau data..  Kendall County Board member Robyn Vickers, who also serves on the county’s Complete Count Commission, said there is still some legal wrangling about what the official last day to respond to the 2020 census is. Regardless, as of about 3:30 p.m. Friday, Oct. 9, households could still respond online ..  Vickers said that, as of Sunday, Oct. 4, 99.8% of all of Illinois has been enumerated – whether that means households responded themselves or an enumerator knocked on the door to complete the household census response that way. As of Friday, that percentage bumped up to 99.9%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau ..  “Which is fantastic,” Vickers said..  As of Tuesday, Kendall County’s self-response rate was at 82.1% – tied with McHenry County at the time..  As of about 2 p.m. Friday, Kendall County was reporting an 82.2% self-response rate – the second highest in the state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Monroe County had an 82.8% self-response rate and McHenry County was at 82.1%..  “I feel really good that, looking at some of the tracks of how [many households have] responded, that we may actually be closer to the 90% target that we are hoping for,” Vickers said..  As of Tuesday, Kendall County’s total response rate was at 83%, according to Vickers..  Vickers confirmed Tuesday enumerators were no longer going door-to-door for census responses..  As of about 2 p.m. Friday, Plano had a self-response rate of 77.1% and Sandwich had a 79.8% rate, per census data . Yorkville had an 82.5% self-response rate, Montgomery was at 82.7% rate and Oswego at 85.7%. According to the bureau, those five cities did not make the state’s top 100 cities with the highest self-response rate for the 2020 census..  Kendall County Board Chairman Scott Gryder said those high rankings within the county are huge. He said county officials have reiterated over and over again that the more households who respond, the more that helps the county potentially secure more funding and resources down the line..  “It’s so important,"" Gryder said..  via | Kendall County Record.

1103,"USGBC: Illinois comes in second for LEED-certified buildings.  January 23, 2020 | The office for Colliers International at 71 S. Wacker Drive in Chicago—designed by Nelson Architects and built out by J.C. Anderson—was certified LEED Platinum..  The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) has announced its list of top 10 states for LEED green building, based on the number of LEED-certified square feet per person. Illinois slipped from the top spot that it held last year to second place, behind Colorado..  Illinois has continually been among the top states for the number of buildings that earn LEED certification every year, and has been a part of the top 10 states for LEED list every single year since the list’s inception. The state certified 3.85 square feet of LEED space per resident in 2019, representing 121 projects and more than 49.3 million gross square feet of space..  LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is the most widely used green building rating system in the world with more than 100,000 projects engaged. This year’s top states are home to more than 105 million people, including more than 80,000 LEED green building professionals with the skills to support the sustainable transformation of buildings..  “As we embark on a new decade, the USGBC community is focused on helping more projects get on the path to LEED certification and a more sustainable future,” said Mahesh Ramanujam, president and CEO, USGBC. “Over the last year, the Top 10 states have certified projects that serve as incredible examples of how green building can create more sustainable and resilient spaces that improve our living standard. There is still much work to be done, but the progress made across these states shows us that our work is having a tangible impact on people’s lives. As we enter our next chapter, we are committed to helping more buildings, cities and communities improve their sustainability performance through LEED.”.  LEED-certified projects support personal health and well-being, as well as use less energy and water, reduce carbon emissions and save money for families, businesses and taxpayers. The Top 10 list is based on 2010 U.S. Census data and includes commercial and institutional green building projects certified throughout 2019.","[0.6487761735916138, 0.3512238562107086]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.6487761735916138
1104,"State Sen. Jim Oberweis (R-Sugar Grove) wonders how much longer Illinois taxpayers will be forced to carry the burden of poor policymaking..  “The solution to Chicago's budget problem is not more taxes,” Oberweis told the Will County Gazette . “Illinois already has the highest combination of state and local taxes in the nation. If Chicago were to add a city income tax to the already high taxes Chicago residents pay, it would lead to even more people leaving Illinois.”.  Supporters are pushing a city income tax to help achieve Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot's stated goal of tackling an $838 million budget shortfall. While still a candidate, Lightfoot scoffed at the notion of a municipal income tax, but she could easily change her tune now that she's faced the seriousness of the city’s fiscal crisis. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot.  A 2011 study conducted by Chicago’s Office of Inspector General estimated that a 1-percent tax could generate as much as $500 million a year. Early last year, the Action Center on Race & the Economy insisted that a 3.5-percent tax only on household incomes over $100,000 could produce upward of $1 billion..  Oberweis, now running against U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-Naperville) in the 14th Congressional District, insists that none of that could convince him to place even more burden on taxpayers..  “I have a long track record of opposing tax increases,” Oberweis said. “This is not a proposal I would support. It is not the fault of taxpayers that city leaders cannot balance the budget. The city has been horribly managed for decades. Let's get the budget under control before city leaders invent a new tax that will hurt the middle class.”.  As Chicago’s population dropped over a four-year period ending in 2017, personal income skyrocketed by more than $10 billion as wealthier residents quickly replaced poorer ones being priced out, according to Illinois Policy Institute Director of Budget Adam Schuster. But Schuster warns that an income tax could quickly drive even more people out of the city..  Oberweis has many of the same concerns..  “If you look at California, a lot of the major cities there have forced middle-class families out because of the high cost to live in those communities,” he said. “If Chicago implements an income tax, we will see the same thing here and that does not bode well for the future of Chicago.” Weekly Newsletter Sign-up and get latest news about the courts, judges and latest complaints - right to your inbox.

WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) — The leaders of Illinois cities met with their senators while in Washington for the U.S. Conference of Mayors , and while there was a lot to discuss, one issue rose above the rest..  “Infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure,” Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., said. “We need to update everything from our roads to our rails to our airports.”.  Naperville Mayor Steve Chirico and Evanston Mayor Stephen Hagerty said cities all around Illinois desperately need federal dollars to repair deteriorating roads and bridges..  “All of a sudden, it will be front and center when a bridge collapses,” Hagerty said..  The mayors spent nearly an hour Thursday morning with Duckworth and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. The senators said they listened and are dedicated to finding solutions..  But Durbin also noted little can be done until Republican President Donald Trump is on board..  “President Trump promised an infrastructure bill,” Durbin said. “We’re hoping we have one.”.  He said the president should consider raising the federal gas tax to pay for roads, noting it “hasn’t been touched in a long, long time.”.  Most mayors said they left the meeting feeling optimistic..  “We have a lot of challenges, but also we have a lot of hope,” Chirico said..  Other issues the mayors brought up included climate change and flooding, as well as new Illinois’ new recreational marijuana law..  Durbin said he is working on decriminalizing marijuana on the federal level so that cannabis business owners in his home state can operate more freely. He said the federal government must conduct studies to debunk lingering unsubstantiated misconceptions about marijuana. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

1107,"After looking at the pain of those in Palos Heights and the refusal of Illinois politicians to fix anything, it’s no wonder some residents are looking for a fresh start..  The pain in Palos Heights.  Property taxes were, of course, a sore spot for many of the attendees. Effective property taxes in Palos Heights are 2.2 percent. That’s higher than the state’s average and more than double what residents in neighboring Kentucky, Indiana and Missouri pay..  Several residents warned that the taxes they faced could drive them out of the community..  Dolores Kramarski, one of Palos Heights’ Aldermen said: “There’s a tax on everything. I’m very disappointed in this state. I was born and raised here. I thought I could retire here, but for the same amount of money I could have twice the home in Florida.”.  And while not all city residents understand why their property taxes are so high, they certainly know there’s a problem. They’ve seen both their home values fall and their incomes stagnate at the same time..  Median home values in Palos Heights are still down 12 percent when compared to 2009, according to the U.S. Census. That’s bad compared to the rising home prices in states all around Illinois . Home values in Wisconsin are up 10 percent, while in Kentucky – the neighbor with the largest increase – they’re up 26 percent. And in Tennessee, where many Illinoisans now call home, home values are up 29 percent..  Incomes in Palos Heights haven’t done much better. Median private-sector earnings are up just 9 percent since 2005, not enough to even keep up with inflation, up 29 percent over the same period..  Residents have been forced to pay more taxes with less income, with some of what they pay going toward ever-higher public safety salaries. The average wage for public safety workers has grown 34 percent, to nearly $100,000 a year, over the past 13 years. Those increases are the result of guaranteed raises provided by the state’s union-friendly collective bargaining rules..  And those aren’t the only public sector salaries residents have to pay for. There are also superintendents with $200K-plus annual salaries that will turn into $6-million-plus in lifetime pension benefits when they retire..  A worsening crisis.  What’s tough is that while taxpayers in the Palos Heights area are paying more and more money for their government, the crisis only seems to deepen..  Take public safety pensions. Despite a quadrupling of taxpayer contributions into the three local public safety funds since 2005, their unfunded liabilities have tripled to $29 million..  And at the state level, nothing is being done about multi-million-dollar pension benefits for teachers and district administrators. The top beneficiaries from Palos Heights two elementary school districts, for example, are expected to receive anywhere from $3 million to $5 million in pension benefits over the course of their retirements. The average, career teacher that has recently retired receives a starting benefit of $65,000 a year and can expect lifetime pension benefits exceeding $2.1 million..  The crisis across Illinois.  Palos Heights residents are not alone in their troubles. A vast number of residents across the state experience the same pressures every day. They’re seeing their property taxes rise year after year. Their home values are stagnating or falling . Their neighbors are leaving . And the state and local pension debts they’re on the hook for continue to skyrocket..  With no relief in sight – politicians aren’t calling for a pension amendment , labor reforms , or a real reduction in the number of local governments – it’s no wonder that groups such as New Illinois are gaining traction with disaffected Illinoisans..  The separation movement’s influence is now big enough that Gov. J.B. Pritzker felt compelled to call them and their legislative sponsors out in his 2021 budget address: “Also, trying to separate Chicago from the rest of Illinois, whether rhetorically or literally, will not solve the economic challenges of downstate Illinois. Quite the opposite. Some of you need to stop pretending that one part of Illinois can exist without all the others. We are one Illinois.”.  But the only thing Illinoisans have gotten from politicians is more taxes and higher fees. And now Gov. Pritzker and others want a progressive tax scheme..  That’s a bad idea, according to former State Sen. Patrick O’Malley , who attended the meeting. Though he now resides in Florida, the 2002 gubernatorial candidate emphatically told the crowd: “Anybody who says any tax increase is going to be constructive for Illinois truly doesn’t know the reality. There is no tax increase anybody in Illinois should vote for.”.  Ald. Kramarski agreed. “Anybody who thinks any tax is going to be in their favor is sadly mistaken,” she said..  Pritzker seems content to dismiss the concerns of ordinary Illinoisans. In response, Illinoisans are either leaving the state – or looking for a way for the state to leave .","[0.5021504163742065, 0.49784958362579346]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5021504163742065

The City partnered with Forefront’s IL Count Me In 2020 initiative to disperse a portion of its $2.7 million Census investment – the largest amount of funding Chicago has ever committed to the Census – to grant funding for community organizations. These grant funds will be used to support targeted community outreach and other initiatives to help increase Census participation for hard-to-count communities. The City of Chicago contributed $500,000 toward this community outreach effort, Uber provided an additional $100,000, the Illinois Department of Aging contributed $75,000 and the McCormick Foundation contributed $25,000..  Grant funds will be used by organizations for outreach within the City’s hardest-to-count community areas. Awardees will leverage grant dollars for community events, social media campaigns, accessible materials, and other on-the-ground outreach designed to build awareness and activate Chicago residents to complete the 2020 Census..  “Achieving a full and fair count in the upcoming census is critical to determining the necessary federal funding levels for our city, appropriate representation in Congress, and securing the continued strength of our regional economy,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “These grants stand as a vital tool to supporting Chicago’s many passionate and committed community partners who will be on the ground and working hard to include all our residents in this important process, and ensuring every voice is heard, felt and accounted for.”.

Forefront looks forward to supporting these grantees as we prepare for Illinois’ Census count this spring.”.  Nearly half of Chicago’s 2.7 million residents are considered “hard-to-count” by the U.S. Census Bureau. This includes families of color, children under five, the elderly, veterans, returning residents, individuals with high rates of mobility and housing instability, residents with disabilities, those with limited access to the Internet, and those who may be afraid to participate..  An accurate count is vital for Chicago as it determines whether the City receives an appropriate level of representation in Congress, as well as the funding that is instrumental to maintaining infrastructure, public safety, public health, and other City services. Funding for many programs benefitting Chicagoans is allocated based on the Census, including Medicaid, Head Start, SNAP, Section 8, Title I and Special Education Grants.

1109,"In his second Budget Address to lawmakers, Governor J.B. Pritzker unveiled a proposal that seeks $1.6 billion in new spending and makes some funding for priorities like education, health care and public safety contingent on the approval of his tax increase..  In other action, legislation has been filed that would change a process that too often leaves citizens waiting for medical treatment due to insurance coverage requirements. Other bills recently filed include a proposal to exempt overtime wages from the income tax, and a measure that would recognize recipients of the Air Force Combat Action Medal..  Governor says new spending relies on his tax.  The Governor put the best face possible on Illinois’ fiscal situation; unfortunately, his glowing assessment does not square with the facts, and his spending plan relies on a huge income tax increase to implement. He also skims over the most fundamental problems we have. We have one of the highest tax burdens in the nation. We are one of the most corrupt states in the nation, and are the only state in the nation that has lost population for the last six years..  We have to change the way things are done in Springfield. We have all these advantages but the politicians keep screwing it up. We have to get rid of the corruption. We have to reduce property taxes. We must address our fundamental pension problem that is stealing the future from our grandchildren. We have to get control of the run-away spending.

New legislation has been filed that would change a healthcare process that currently leaves many Illinois residents waiting for medical treatment because of insurance coverage requirements..  Illinois patients often have medical care delayed or denied because of their health plans’ use of a process called prior authorization. Senate Bill 3822 is a bipartisan solution that supporters say will bring much-needed transparency and streamlining to prior authorization requirements..  Health insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers use prior authorization to cut costs, requiring health professionals to do extra paperwork before their recommended patient care is approved. Even when authorization is granted, too often insurance companies later deny payment for medical care they approved..  Prior authorization requirements are often not based on clinically valid criteria, and are administered by individuals who lack relevant qualifications. The Prior Authorization Reform Act would make sure prior authorization requirements are based on medical evidence and administered by qualified individuals..  Senate Bill 3822 has been introduced in the Senate and awaits assignment to a legislative committee where it will receive a public hearing..  Exempting overtime wages from tax.  Illinois residents who work overtime would find some tax relief under recently filed legislation that would exempt overtime wages from the state income tax..  Senate Bill 3695 would create a deduction on any overtime wages earned in Illinois. Wages earned in excess to a taxpayer’s regular monthly or weekly salary would be exempt from the state income tax..  The state income tax on overtime wages would still be withheld from an individual’s paycheck; however, when that person goes to file their taxes for that year, they would receive a deduction equal to the amount of taxes paid on overtime wages..

1110,"by Lydia Bhattacharya February 25, 2020.  Now that homeowners have experienced multiple tax cycles under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, many have been confronted with a reduced ability to write off state and local taxes, which means property tax rates have become a more visible part of buyers’ budgets. That’s why a recent article by WalletHub that ranks U.S. states and the District of Columbia in terms of their property tax rates is worth a close look, especially for real estate professionals in [CITY]..  Illinois ranked as the state with the second highest property tax rates, with only New Jersey ranking lower. The effective real estate tax rate clocked in at 2.3 percent and the annual taxes collected on a $205,000 home (the median value for a home in the U.S.) were $4,705. Looking specifically at the state’s median home value of $187,200, Wallethub estimated that Illinoisans would pay $4,299 in that case. When compared to Alabama, the state with the second lowest property tax rate, owners of homes at the state median value ($137,200) were estimated to pay only $840 in annual taxes..  Based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Wallethub estimated that “the average American household spends $2,375 on property taxes for their homes each year.”.  Wallethub also asked a panel of “property-tax experts” about the importance of property tax rates and how they apply to different consumer groups. A key question for real estate professionals was whether people consider property taxes in the process of deciding where to move..  Of the three experts who answered this question, all agreed that property taxes are important to factor in while buying a home. Two respondents noted that, in the past, fewer buyers paid attention to property taxes, but with new tax laws in place at the federal level, many have had to adjust their budgets and be flexible during the homebuying process..  “Traditionally, property taxes were not an incredibly important consideration for people deciding to move from one location to another,” said Andrew D. Appleby, an assistant professor of law at the Stetson University College of Law. “After the TCJA, state and local taxes generally are often now an overriding consideration in the relocation decision.”.  Paula R. Worthington, a senior lecturer and academic director at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, observed that “lots of empirical evidence suggests that people are willing to pay more for houses with low property taxes than for similar houses with higher property taxes, assuming the schools and other local public services are similar. So, house prices, property taxes and local public services are closely related.”.  Also, real estate professionals should be ready to factor this into their budget conversations with first-time homebuyers. Mitchell Franklin, an associate professor of accounting at the Madden School of Business at Le Moyne College, warned that “in a high tax state, it is not uncommon for monthly property taxes to be as much as a mortgage payment.”","[0.5606642961502075, 0.43933573365211487]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5606642961502075
1111,"Getty Images.  Greg Baise.  For the sixth year in a row, Illinois' population has continued to plummet. If left up to the politicians in Springfield, it's only going to get worse..  That may sound dire, but the facts in this case couldn't be clearer. It's really a simple matter of cause and effect..  Over the last decade, Springfield politicians raised the state income tax twice to deal with out-of-control spending, and we still have an $8 billion budget deficit and bill backlog. As a result, they have instituted some of the highest taxes on middle-class families ever seen in this state. In fact, Illinois already has some of the highest state and local taxes in the country and the second-highest property taxes . This last year alone, more than a billion dollars in new taxes landed in the laps of taxpayers..  Yet, when asked to explain why Illinois is losing population, the governor ignores numerous surveys and polls showing that people and businesses are leaving the state because of high taxes and a lack of good-paying jobs. He instead claims his ""relationships"" in Springfield will somehow save the state. Never mind a 2018 United Van Lines survey showed Illinois is a top outbound state, with 46 percent of those surveyed citing jobs as the reason to leave..  Despite Illinois being ranked as one of the unfriendliest tax climates in the country, the governor would have you believe that what we really need to stem the flow of people from the state is even more taxes on job creators via a graduated income tax..  It's as if the concept of cause and effect doesn't exist in the world of Springfield politicians..  Don't take my word for it. Look no further than the two other states with large population declines: California and New York. Like Illinois, they are big states with large populations, have politicians who like to spend money and, you guessed it, have high taxes..  The one thing California and New York have right now that Illinois does not, however, is a graduated income tax..  With their graduated taxes, California and New York are witnessing business owners flee in droves, resulting in workers leaving for more promising futures in more tax friendly states. Last year, reports cited the exodus of New Yorkers to tax-friendly states as the main reason for its $2.3 billion budget deficit..  The cause and effect are obvious. Politicians rarely, if ever, stop their spending, and as business owners leave, it will be the middle class who is left holding the bag..  All of this out-of-control spending and taxing means that Illinois, New York and California are all losing a congressional seat in the same year for the first time ever. The trends show they will continue losing jobs, population and their tax base until their elected officials show fiscal discipline..

1112,"Getty Images.  Greg Baise.  For the sixth year in a row, Illinois' population has continued to plummet. If left up to the politicians in Springfield, it's only going to get worse..  That may sound dire, but the facts in this case couldn't be clearer. It's really a simple matter of cause and effect..  Over the last decade, Springfield politicians raised the state income tax twice to deal with out-of-control spending, and we still have an $8 billion budget deficit and bill backlog. As a result, they have instituted some of the highest taxes on middle-class families ever seen in this state. In fact, Illinois already has some of the highest state and local taxes in the country and the second-highest property taxes . This last year alone, more than a billion dollars in new taxes landed in the laps of taxpayers..  Yet, when asked to explain why Illinois is losing population, the governor ignores numerous surveys and polls showing that people and businesses are leaving the state because of high taxes and a lack of good-paying jobs. He instead claims his ""relationships"" in Springfield will somehow save the state. Never mind a 2018 United Van Lines survey showed Illinois is a top outbound state, with 46 percent of those surveyed citing jobs as the reason to leave..  Despite Illinois being ranked as one of the unfriendliest tax climates in the country, the governor would have you believe that what we really need to stem the flow of people from the state is even more taxes on job creators via a graduated income tax..  It's as if the concept of cause and effect doesn't exist in the world of Springfield politicians..  Don't take my word for it. Look no further than the two other states with large population declines: California and New York. Like Illinois, they are big states with large populations, have politicians who like to spend money and, you guessed it, have high taxes..  The one thing California and New York have right now that Illinois does not, however, is a graduated income tax..  With their graduated taxes, California and New York are witnessing business owners flee in droves, resulting in workers leaving for more promising futures in more tax friendly states. Last year, reports cited the exodus of New Yorkers to tax-friendly states as the main reason for its $2.3 billion budget deficit..  The cause and effect are obvious. Politicians rarely, if ever, stop their spending, and as business owners leave, it will be the middle class who is left holding the bag..  All of this out-of-control spending and taxing means that Illinois, New York and California are all losing a congressional seat in the same year for the first time ever. The trends show they will continue losing jobs, population and their tax base until their elected officials show fiscal discipline..  Luckily, Illinois voters this November have a chance to put a stop to this downward spiral by saying ""no"" to the graduated income tax..  A vote to stop this tax is a message to Springfield politicians that Illinois taxpayers will not give them even more of their hard-earned dollars until they get their spending under control.

February 25, 2020 01:35 PM Staff Chicago Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara and a rendering of the proposed Obama Presidential Center (Credit: The City of Chicago and the Obama Foundation).  The Obama Presidential Center is coming, but not without controversy. Now, Chicago is considering a measure to promote neighborhood growth and preserve affordable housing near the proposed $500 million site amid gentrification concerns from residents..  Under the proposed ordinance, the city would use about $4.5 million to help lower-income residents in the Woodlawn area make home improvements, help some buy homes and support others in buying and repairing vacant buildings, according to the Chicago Tribune..  It would also require developers to incorporate a certain number of affordable units if they want to build a residential complex on vacant land owned by the city..  Unveiled Monday, the measure can be amended based on feedback, Chicago Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara told the Tribune..  The Obama Center is expected to attract thousands of visitors, along with new businesses and development. Critics say it will also lead to rising home prices and rents..  A group called the Obama Community Benefits Agreement Coalition is advocating for an ordinance that would require new housing developments to dedicate 30 percent of their units to low-income renters. It also wants the city to establish a rental assistance fund, which isn’t included in the proposed ordinance..  Last month, the Housing Department proposed a less stringent measure, which would apply only to census tracts within three-fifths of a mile of the Obama Center .

1114,"Illinois may boast some of the lowest divorce rates in the nation, but think twice before you dub the state a lover’s paradise..  In Illinois, 6.6 percent of marriages end in divorce, according to 2018 United States Census Bureau data. Other states with notably low divorce rates include Hawaii, New York and Vermont. Arkansas tops the list as the divorce capital of the nation, with the state home to 17.14 divorced people per 1,000 married individuals..  Nationwide, it seems love isn’t everlasting: couples marrying for the first time in the United States have an approximately 50 percent chance of divorcing. Overall rates paint a slightly more promising picture, with the percent of divorced American couples hovering around 16 percent..  Joshua Stern, a founder and managing partner of the Illinois-based divorce and family law firm Stern Perkoski, said a couple’s decision to stay together often comes down to cost. In Illinois, divorce can come with a hefty price tag — according to the Berry K. Tucker & Associates, Ltd. website, Illinois ranks among the top ten states with the priciest divorce fees, which the Chicago-based family law firm estimates amount to around $13,800..  Accounting for factors like child custody and support, alimony, and property division, divorce fees can total upwards of $35,000. Financial problems are the primary contributing factor in 36.1 percent of divorces, according to a study conducted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information..  “People think a lot about the cash flow and when and where they’re going to see the kids,” Stern said. “Inevitably, if you get divorced, you’re now taking two incomes that are supporting one household and asking them to support two households. Usually, people see a drop in their available cash flow.”.  Victoria Baum, a marriage and relationship counselor who formerly practiced in Evanston, said “there’s no simple answer” to explain the state’s low divorce rate. The popularity of cohabitation — an arrangement in which an unmarried, romantically-involved couple lives together — may deflate Illinois’ divorce rate. In the state, less than 65 percent of people older than 15 years old are married, according to 2017 American Community Survey estimates..  The age at which couples marry and have children may also explain their marriages’ longevity. In Illinois, men get married at an average age of 30, and most women tie the knot at around 29. Twenty years ago, the average man found himself hitched at 26.8, and the average woman at 25.1..  Maturity may play a role: Couples who marry and have children later in life tend to be more financially secure, and, as a result, bicker far less about money matters, according to Spring Tree Counseling licensed marriage and family therapist Farrah Walker..  “Older couples have had that time to develop a shared idea of what they want their marriage to look like,” Walker said. “Having kids automatically creates strain on relationships; it’s less strenuous when your relationship has had longer to develop. You’re getting married older in a different stage of life. You had time to develop some of those habits in a relationship prior to having kids.”.  Aside from delaying the big day or choosing to forgo it altogether, what else can couples do to ensure nothing but death does them part? Evanston-based licensed marriage and family therapist Tom Hammerman said long-lasting marriages are often characterized by open communication, which couples therapy can facilitate..  Hammerman said couples considering divorce should first pursue marriage counseling..  “The role of couples therapy is that I get people to be able to have conversations in a way they’re not able to do on their own,” Hammerman said. “How people talk in relationships and how they communicate with each other makes a huge difference.”.  Still, there’s no guarantee Illinois couples are certain to live happily ever after. Understanding the Prairie State’s low divorce rate comes down to “sociological, not psychological” factors, Baum said..  Ultimately, chalking up the low rates to marital harmony is “a case,” Baum said, “of rose-colored glasses.”.

The analysis categorized essential workers by using 12 occupation categories released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The categories include employees who work in health care support, building and ground maintenance, transportation and construction.

More than 54% of essential workers in the Chicago area are people of color, compared to 44% of all regional workers, the study found. Essential workers include those who work for the CTA, Pace and Metra.(Terrence Antonio James/Chicago Tribune).  More than 54% of essential workers are people of color, compared with 44% of all workers in the region, the study found. Black workers are most overrepresented in health care support and protective services jobs, whereas Hispanic workers are overrepresented in both construction and food service industries, according to the analysis. Many essential workers live on the South and West sides of the city; in nearby south, southwest and west suburban Cook County; and in job centers in Lake, DuPage and Will counties, according to the analysis..  The analysis also found that 1 in 4 essential workers lives in a census tract that has a median household income at least 30% below the regional median of $70,500..  However, the estimates excluded workers in some industries that have become essential during the coronavirus pandemic. For example, grocery store employees are classified under a nonessential occupation role as retail sales workers. Austen Edwards, a senior policy analyst at the agency, said the analysis speaks to new and long-running economic pressures that workers in these sectors are facing. In beginning to examine data, Chicago can better look at how to provide better equitable access to education, health care and government services, he said..  “It speaks to longer-term trends in employment that we continue to see play out today,” he said. “When we’re thinking of coronavirus and the shift to long-term recovery, we need to have a strong understanding of long-term trends and what opportunities are being presented to workers.” Latest Coronavirus","[0.6953021287918091, 0.3046979010105133]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6953021287918091
1119,"(The Center Square) – With the last session days of April having been canceled, reform advocates’ hopes of passing a ballot initiative before Illinois redraws its political boundaries become a near impossibility. The Illinois Constitution requires a ballot initiative to be enacted via the General Assembly six months before the election that it will be on. November’s election is the last chance to change the state’s guiding charter before lawmakers are to take decennial Census data and rework political boundaries, absent public input. With the final three chances for a constitutional amendment having been canceled due to the still-prevalent threat of COVID-19, the state’s deadline is almost assuredly to be reached without lawmakers acting on the two proposals. Each has dozens of sponsors and bipartisan support. A February poll commissioned by Change Illinois, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that 75 percent of the state’s voters support the ballot initiatives. Under the proposals, an independent redistricting commission would be chosen to draw the political maps for the Illinois Senate and House. Advocates have said this will provide for fairer elections instead of placing power over district lines in the hands of politicians who have a vested interest in getting re-elected. “It’s such a political process that we go through,” said Ryan Tolley, policy director at Change Illinois. “We really need to understand what’s best for Illinois voters.” Tolley said an independent map commission wouldn’t magically tip the political scales toward Republicans, but rather create more competitive races. Just about half of Illinois lawmakers will be unopposed in their November elections..  Senate Minority Leader Bill Brady, R-Bloomington, released a statement Monday afternoon calling for lawmakers to return to Springfield..  “Today I called the governor, the speaker of the House and the president of the Senate and told them Illinois Senate Republicans stand ready to return to Springfield to take up the timely and important issues facing Illinois and its residents such as the fair maps amendment and COVID-19 related issues,"" he said. ""The work we do for our residents is essential and it can be done in a safe manner by following the proper social distancing guidelines. Other units of government are meeting and doing the people’s business. It is time for the Illinois legislature to do so.” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said on the campaign trail that he would veto any legislative map drawn by Democrats that seemed unfair. Should he veto the proposal crafted by legislative Democrats, a unified caucus in both House and Senate could override it and make the maps a reality. “President Harmon has worked throughout his legislative career to improve the redistricting process,” said John Patterson, spokesman for Senate President Don Harmon. “He looks forward to working with advocates to explore ideas once we are able to move past this global pandemic and its fallout.” Patterson confirmed that one of the lawmakers who sponsored the amendment was in discussion to institute a similar measure by law.

1123,"Today, we weigh in on two Illinois legislative races featuring incumbents from each party. Rep. Tony McCombie, a Savanna Republican, represents District 71, while Rep. Mike Halpin is a Rock Island Democrat representing the 72nd House district..  The two lawmakers could hardly be more different in political philosophy, but we hope voters return both of them in November. Here's why:.  Illinois District 71.  McCombie is a former mayor who knows her district, who knows that Illinois’ population loss is an especially big issue for border communities like ours. She is a fiscal conservative in a state that needs more of them, and since she was elected in 2016, she has grown in the job..  McCombie isn’t just a knee-jerk, pro-business Republican. She has demonstrated her support for labor, and she is a strong voice for changing Springfield's corrupt practices. There's much to like about her..  We would say the same about her opponent, Joan Padilla, the executive director of a non-profit cancer wellness center in Dixon. She speaks with clarity about the state’s fiscal challenges, but she balances those concerns with a mission to improve needed services. Her non-profit experience is appealing, and she has clearly thought about the issues..  Still, we believe McCombie is the best choice in this race. We like her local government experience and her common-sense approach. McCombie offers straight talk and will push for controls on spending and continue demanding ethics reform. We endorse Tony McCombie..  Illinois District 72.  State Rep. Mike Halpin fits his party and his district. He has a strong progressive record, working for labor and working families. Halpin backs the constitutional amendment allowing the state to enact a graduated income tax to raise more money from wealthier Illinoisans, and he makes convincing arguments for the change. He is a legislator who does his homework, which we saw clearly on this issue and others in our interview with him..  A lawyer, Halpin has worked hard to help people. He backed the measure to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. And while this editorial board did not like the plan that was eventually approved, we respect Halpin's vote and his belief that it is best for his working-class constituents..  Halpin is running against Republican Glen Evans Sr., who has run for several positions in previous elections..  We believe Halpin is the best choice in this race. We would like to see more independence from him, though. We wish he had been among those lawmakers who called out Speaker Mike Madigan in the wake of the ComEd scandal. Instead, he dodged questions about it. Still, he is a solid and thoughtful legislator. We endorse Mike Halpin.

1124,"CARTHAGE, Ill. — Carthage Mayor Jim Nightingale wants to make sure his community and others across Hancock County get a share of COVID-19 support available from the state and federal government..  “It seems like with this virus and the money coming back from the federal government to the state that small communities are just being left out. I’m hoping that maybe there’s a solution for this,” Nightingale said..  Nightingale, fellow mayors and other Hancock County leaders had a chance to discuss concerns and look for solutions at a Wednesday afternoon roundtable with U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood, state Sen. Jil Tracy and state Rep. Randy Frese..  “Rural Illinois really needs help. We’ve just had no resources to draw on. We’ve kind of been drowning,” Hancock County Economic Development Executive Director Belynda Allen said. “This event will help raise awareness not only for Hancock County but also for the rest of Illinois. It can hopefully get some eyes on these parts of Illinois where it’s difficult for them to get resources and help they need to get through this.”.  Even the venue, the Legacy Theater in Carthage, offered a stark reminder of what the county stands to lose – and already has lost due to COVID-19..  “The Legacy Theater hasn’t been able to have a show all year,” Allen said. “Tourism is devastated. Ag is taking a huge hit.”.  LaHood heard from mayors across the county frustrated in dealing with state government, worried about revenue shortfalls and concerned about COVID’s impact on census numbers..  LaHood supports another federal relief package to help businesses still disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and municipalities, particularly those with populations less than 250,000..  With Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat, he introduced the Clean Start Act which, if approved as part of the next relief package, would provide a 50% tax credit or tax incentive for schools or businesses to write off costs of personal protective equipment, plexiglass, cleaning supplies and masks to help “on the economic side and on the health care side” to protect customers, workers and kids..  “When we look at the next relief package, the next stimulus package, we’ll be trying to assist them with the bureaucracy, getting them the resources they need,” LaHood said. “We also have to understand where the money needs to go.”.  Another area of concern, underscored by the pandemic, is the lack of connectivity in rural areas, and it’s become an issue for urban and rural legislators. “It affects education, affects business, affects our farmer and of course health care,” LaHood said..  Carl Sandburg College President Seamus Reilly said the digital divide is one of the greatest barriers in education and key to growth of rural communities..  “The digital divide can become the economic digital connection for Hancock County and all the parts of western Illinois, but to do that we need the state and federal government to build that internet highway,” Reilly said..  With people likely to continue working from home even after COVID-19, with reliable broadband service, “Hancock County becomes an area where people can live and work anywhere in the world,” said Blanche Shoup, director of the Workforce Investment Board of Western Illinois..  Nightingale said Carthage expects to see the biggest financial impact on its sales tax revenue and its share of the state income tax..  In its budget for the year starting May 1, the city trimmed its anticipated sales tax revenues by 25% and its state tax revenue by 10% “so we wouldn’t have to go back to the council and amend the budget,” he said. “Right now we’re pretty much on track.”.  Hancock County Farm Bureau Manager Kristin Huls said it was important for LaHood to hear about the struggles being faced by farmers, communities and business owners in the rural part of the state..  “We have new businesses coming and also some going,” Huls said. “We hear about how it’s affecting the cities, but maybe not so much the rural communities.”.  Carthage banker Mike Bavery worked with several customers on Paycheck Protection Program loans, which had a very simple application process, but to get forgiveness of the loans is “arduous work” for small businesses trying to get back on their feet..  While there’s broad agreement in Congress that any loan under $150,000 should be forgiven, “it’s clearly a deficiency we have not solved. We have to work on it,” LaHood said..  Communities joined forces with Hancock County in June to seek nearly $300,000 through the Downstate Small Business Stabilization Program for 14 businesses grants, but is still waiting to hear about the grants. “These people really need some help,” Nightingale said..  The mayors see value in working together as a group — and working with the County Board, Nightingale said..  “It’s very important in small counties like Hancock,” he said. “We just feel like with this we’ve got a greater voice to our legislators.”","[0.5052409172058105, 0.49475908279418945]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5052409172058105
1125,"/ Francis Menton My first blog post on the subject of Chicago was way back in 2012 . In that post, I placed Chicago in the special category of American cities that I called the “basket cases” — places with declining populations, astoundingly high rates of violent crime, in every case mostly black on black, and, of course, uninterrupted rule by leftist Democrats for generations. I had this to say about Chicago: You may ask, is Chicago really basket case? . . . The downtown is in good shape, with new condos and office towers; the near north side is upscale and attractive. But the population has gone from a peak of 3,620,962 in the 1950 census to just 2,695,598 in 2010. [And if instead of staying downtown you take] the Green Line el south from the loop to the end of the line, . . . you will observe huge deteriorated public housing projects surrounded by vast vacant areas and abandoned private buildings. The violent crime rate also clearly qualifies Chicago for the label of basket case. Murders hit a peak of 756 in 2016 (about 28 per hundred thousand people, compared to a rate for the U.S. as a whole of about 5 per 100,000). After a few years of modest declines, murders are on track to equal or top the 756 this year, with 440 through July . In fact, July 2020 just set a new record for most murders in a month, with 105 . Of course, Chicago has been ruled entirely by Democrats for generations. Its last Republican mayor left office in 1931. Of 50 alderman in the city, 46 are Democrats and the other 4 are Independents. In the 2016 election , the city of Chicago voted for Clinton over Trump by 84% to 13%. Which brings us up to the last couple of days. Apparently, on Sunday there was an incident where the Chicago police shot and injured a black suspect. The police claim that the suspect was armed and had shot at them first; but they have no video to prove that. Whether the police behaved wrongly remains to be established, and if they did, the officers in question should be dealt with accordingly. But there is no justifying what followed. On Sunday night into Monday there was a first wave of looting in the downtown area. On Monday, the Chicago chapter of Black Lives Matter put out a press release that dropped all pretense of “peaceful protests” and explicitly sought to justify the looting, while also threatening further violence: The mayor clearly has not learned anything since [the killing of George Floyd in] May, and she would be wise to understand that the people will keep rising up until the CPD is abolished and our Black communities are fully invested in. Contrary to Mayor Lightfoot’s position, Black lives are and always will be more important than downtown corporations who siphon Tax Increment Financing (T.I.F.) money, while avoiding taxes, and exploiting the labor of Black and Brown Chicagoans. These corporations have “looted” more from our communities than a few protesters ever could. . . . [Some] commentators seem to believe that the immense wealth that has been hoarded in downtown Chicago is in some way all of ours. The South and West sides have seen no benefits to this hoarding. . . . When protesters attack high-end retail stores that are owned by the wealthy and service the wealthy, that is not “our” city and has never been meant for us. At a BLM demonstration yesterday, a large banner explicitly advocated looting: Then last night, a second wave of looting erupted in Chicago, including both in the downtown and in the luxury shopping district just north of downtown known as the “Miracle Mile.” There are many videos of the looting, which appears to have been orchestrated on social media. I’m just completely mystified about the thought process. Let’s assume the worst for the police as to the incident on Sunday. Even so, how is that somehow a bigger issue than the well-over-300 blacks murdered so far this year in Chicago by people who are not the police? And again, even if you assume the worst about the police incident, how is looting an appropriate response? Encouraging young black people to go out on looting sprees is making them completely unemployable in any professional job and ruining whatever chance they might have had for high paying jobs and careers. The demonstrators shout “black lives matter” while they destroy black lives by the hundreds or thousands. We are witnessing the complete dead end of the progressive movement in Marxist idiocy.

""There's definitely a need for more teachers, and especially in southern Illinois where we have a lower population rate,"" said Shawnee Community College Interim President Kathleen Curphy. She is in favor of a new bill that would help keep aspiring teachers in Illinois. ""And it's very, very hard to bring in outsiders; so, if we have the opportunity to grow our own or to keep our local people here, we should use that opportunity to do so."".  Senate Bill 1809 generated overwhelming support in the senate where it passed 56-to-1 in April. The MAP Grant Teacher Extension bill offers an additional year of funding for students who enroll in a state-approved educator program, and teaches in Illinois for a minimum of three years..  Shawnee student Faith Giel said being financially stable is an important part of continuing her education. She said she will look into applying for this program if it becomes law..  ""They're giving me the tools I need to give those students what they need later on,"" said Giel. ""So, it is incentive, and it's exactly what education is about; offering tools and getting people to where they need to be (to be) successful."".  Shawnee is already in the process of addressing teacher shortages. Shawnee redesigned its teaching program to make the transition to SIU, SEMO and Murray easier for students..  ""They can come here, finish a degree, go to SIUC in Carbondale and then stay in the area where their family and friends are,"" said Curphy.  Which is exactly what Giel said she wants: to finish school and stay in Illinois with a career in teaching, ""Because I wouldn't want to teach in a place that doesn't feel like home."".  To keep recipients of the additional grant funding in Illinois, teachers who fail to live up to their end of the bargain would be required to repay a portion of that funding dependent on how long they taught here.","[0.7604315280914307, 0.23956845700740814]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.7604315280914307

1135,"Illinois low census response puts federal dollars at risk Updated 10:07 am EDT, Sunday, August 23, 2020.  CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) — A low census response rate in southern Illinois is putting millions of federal dollars for infrastructure improvements, education and social service programs at risk..  As of Monday, only about 46% of Carbondale households had responded to the 2020 census survey, The Southern Illinoisan reports. City officials estimate a loss of about $1,600 per year for every person who fails to respond — or $16,000 over a decade. The census count concludes Sept. 30..  Most southern Illinois counties' response rate is significantly below the overall Illinois response rate of 69%..  Carbondale Planning Director Chris Wallace said the city's low response rate is mostly tied to Southern Illinois University students. College students are counted in the community where they attend school, not where their home address is. He says the student population is traditionally hard to reach and the coronavirus pandemic has made it even harder..  Students have not returned to campus since spring break due to the pandemic. Jeanine Beasley, media coordinator for the U.S. Census Bureau’s Chicago office, said the agency is working directly with the university to count students who were living both on and off campus during the spring semester..

Last Thursday, 5/21/2020, great information was shared by notable figures: Carl Tutt Chairman – 100 BMC Partner, Green Technologies, LLC, Juan Thomas, JD Founder – Thomas Law Group, Darryl Arrington Assistant VP DePaul University, Michael Frerichs Illinois State Treasurer. While Facebook was brought in a little late on the conversation and had technical difficulties, we were still able to catch some great information..  Daryl Arrington addressed the concerns of many with the reopening of colleges and Universities and how to address specific criteria. “We are looking into how to deal with state regulations and how to keep the students safe. Schools will do a variety of online learning and be open, but this pandemic is changing how we are doing things”..  Michael Frerichs goes into great detail about how the treasures office is helping small business and why they are helping small businesses..  “The best investments we can make is in Illinois small businesses because 1) we make money and 2) if we help keep people employed and help these businesses grow, that means more tax dollars coming into the state and lower unemployment.”.  Frerichs also tells us a problem with the PPP program and why many small businesses weren’t allowed to participate. Frerichs says, “All the money went to the big banks, and those banks wanted to work with their established customers, most of whom are the big businesses. The banks are just getting a fee based on the number of dollars loaned out, so they felt it was better to have a few companies with large amounts of loans rather than small companies with smaller loans.”.  He says the treasures office took an opposite approach. Carl Tutt discusses the importance of the 2020 census and how communities have to stop looking at the short term for finances..  Tutt says, “While the stimulus check is ok short term, there is a long term financial issue which is the census. There are dollars out there that we can get over this next decade if we make sure that we go and sign up and do the 2020 census. Lets not just think short term lets make sure we have what we need not just for this year but the next ten years”..  Tutt also talks about the digital divide in the community and how it will help cut down on violence, especially since summertime is here. “We have to make sure the digital divide is not widened. We have to make sure that every household has internet access and that every child in that household has some digital device so that they can stay competitive and learn and grow. Violence down and Mask up is doing this right now. By making sure the digital divide is not widened, violence in our communities will be reduced.”.

According to city officials, 53% of Chicagoans have responded to the Census so far. That’s short of Lightfoot’s 75% goal and the 66% participation rate during the last Census..  “Now more than ever it is critical for Chicago’s residents to fill out their Census forms and make themselves count,” Lightfoot said.","[0.7428407669067383, 0.2571592628955841]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.7428407669067383
1153,"During the last two months, the power of community has been on full display as our friends and neighbors respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. Businesses, nonprofit partners and individuals have all answered the call for help. Like other organizations, United Way of Central Illinois has had to adjust and find new ways to adapt during this pandemic..  Every year more than 300 volunteers come together for one day to do as much good as possible. This year volunteers from across the community will rally once again — although this year, many from their homes..  Unfortunately, with COVID-19 still ongoing and ever changing, United Way’s in-person Day of Action projects planned for June 19 and 20 have been canceled. Despite the cancellation of an in person volunteer event, United Way is excited to reveal Week of Action and the opportunity for individuals to help their community..  This summer we will be challenging volunteers to engage in remote volunteer projects throughout the week of June 14 through 20. Examples of remote projects include writing letters of support for seniors, making masks for local agencies, participating in remote mock interviews with human resources professionals or saying thank you to our essential workers..  We will also be offering a limited number of in person activities, keeping social distancing in mind, during Week of Action. These projects include donating baby supplies during our community baby shower, participating in Adopt a Street in downtown Springfield, or bringing donations to a food drive at our office. We will be releasing more information about our Week of Action on our website, volunteer.springfieldunitedway.org..  We are invested in keeping volunteers in our community safe. All in-person activities are designed to keep volunteers safe while still giving you an opportunity to make a difference..  Our annual Day of Action may look different this year, but it still means big things for our community. Week of Action is the chance to show everyone in our community that even though we are apart, we are United..  Even in our new normal, problems still persist. With schools transitioning to online learning and starting to close for summer, our low-income students are in need of even more assistance. Schools and summer programs are sometimes a student's primary source of food, shelter, and physical safety..  Local agencies are helping to fill this gap. Programs like Compass for Kids’ Backpack Feeding program is a partnership between Compass for Kids, HSHS St. John's Hospital, and the Central Illinois Foodbank which provides meals for the children in Club Compass and Camp Compass. This program continues during COVID-19 and volunteers are using safety precautions including social distancing and delivery only. Compass for Kids received funds from the COVID-19 Response Fund to help offset increased expenses for food and staffing to continue the important work of the Backpack Feeding Program..  Many of our local programs are also adapting for virtual learning. For example, to continue to serve their club members, Boys and Girls Club of Central Illinois launched their VClub platform. Club members can participate in fun activities and educational programs without leaving home. Boys and Girls Club of Central Illinois also received funds from the COVID-19 Response Fund to assist with costs of the virtual Club and their activity packet program..  COVID-19 is a new test of our collective strength. Even in these difficult times, we are committed to bringing people together to solve our nation’s greatest challenges and fight for those most in need. The 2020 Census is still happening and it has never been more important to get counted..  The census is a count of every person in every community. But it’s more than just knowing how many people live in each city. The census helps determine the share of political power and federal funding across different communities. Participating in the census is in everyone's best interest, because it helps community leaders and elected officials plan for school class sizes, health facilities, public transit and the placement of grocery stores..  Now, it has never been easier to be counted in the Census by self-reporting from home. Take the Census online, over the phone, or by mail and save the Census taker a trip to your door. Visit My2020Census.gov to fill it out in less than ten minutes..  We are a community that is full of hand-raisers and doers. One full of people who are strong, compassionate, generous and full of resolve. Even though we are apart, we are United. We know if we come together, we’ll get through this and be stronger on the other side..  John Kelker is the President of United Way of Central Illinois.

1154,"A trailblazing Windy City brewery has gotten quite crafty during this election season. 5 Rabbit Cerveceria , which prides itself on being the first Latino-owned and operated brewery in the United States, is reselling its popular Blonde Ale, which was initially set for exclusive availability at Chicago’s Trump International Hotel in 2015. Advertisement But as the Bedford Park microbrewery was readying to take its kegs to the swanky hotel rooftop, the building’s namesake morphed into a polarizing presidential candidate and made offensive remarks, notably calling Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists. Husband and wife owners Mila Ramirez and Andres Araya quickly disassociated themselves from Trump. Advertisement And instead of taking a huge financial loss on the big batch of beer, they decided to rebrand it. (Garret Baumer/Field Creative) After brainstorming, Trump Golden Ale had a new name: Ch--ga Tu Pelo, which translates directly to “F--- Your Hair.” The alcoholic brew — available in 16 oz cans with a caricature of Trump’s infamous hairstyle illustrated on it — became a phenomenon and sold out in hours. The couple has resurrected the popular beer and said all of the customers who drink it are standing with the company’s stance against racism and ignorance. 5 Rabbit is selling their final run of Ch--ga Tu Pelo with a mission to encourage Latino voter turnout. [More Snyde] SEE IT: Kanye West’s gifts Kim Kardashian hologram of her late father Robert for 40th birthday » “Latinos are the largest growing population in the United States, so imagine if we voted in mass, the difference we could make,” Ramirez told the Daily News on Wednesday. “Organizing locally, registering to vote and voting, filling out your census are the ways that we can make a difference, and people need to know this.” The Lima, Peru-born, married mother of two feels that the Latino population is dramatically underrepresented in terms of voice, and political positions. “If a Latino isn’t voting or is taking voting for granted, that is a huge problem,” she maintained. “I believe in pulling people from the bottom up. I believe in empathy and where we stand morally as human beings. I believe in taking care of the environment, and that climate change is real, we need to take care of our poor and marginalized."" “I think that separating children … babies … from their parents and locking them up in cages, taking away rights from the LGBTQ communities, protecting millionaires, among others, are the type of sins that Trump supporters should be worried about,” she added. 5 Rabbit brewery At its Bedford Park production brewery, 5 Rabbit recently hosted two organizations — Poor People’s Campaign and Mujeres Latinas en Accion, whose mission is to get Latinos to vote. Ramirez is incensed that there are Latino people supporting Trump. According to polls by Equis Research in key swing states from Arizona to Nevada, Latino male voters show much more support for Trump than Latina voters. Advertisement “My first thought is, please love your community, your friends, your family, and yourself a little more,” she said. “This man has been openly hateful toward your community and even though you may not realize it, toward you too.” [More Snyde] Paul Rudd hands out cookies to voters in Brooklyn » The 42-year-old entrepreneur added: “I think the biggest reason Latinos still support Trump is probably because they are conservative and using religious reasons which is absurd. I am a Catholic, and I would say that although our definition of liberal probably doesn’t apply to those times, from what we know about Jesus, he was probably a progressive liberal. I am sure if he were alive today, his person of choice to lead America would not be Donald Trump. Unfortunately for Latinas, internalized racism and xenophobia are real, too. The need for acceptance from white America blinds and deafens Latinos voting for Trump, and it is a shame.” As far as 5 Rabbit’s initial connection to Trump, Ramirez has regrets. But she admits to her faults of not understanding the full scope of the former star of “The Apprentice” and his dubious past with race relations. The Daily News Flash Newsletter Weekdays You are now following this newsletter. See all newsletters. “In my eyes, Trump was nothing but a reality TV clown before he ran for president,” she shared. “Maybe I should have known he was a racist, but I wasn’t aware.” “In that moment in time, all we knew was his reality TV persona,"" Ramirez furthered. ""When he came out publicly having such hateful remarks about my fellow Latinos and our name was suddenly associated with his name, even if it was in a very tiny way, it suddenly clicked that we needed to remove ourselves completely from anything to do with Trump. The public protest came later and almost accidentally, but I am glad it did.” [More Snyde] Lil Wayne backs Trump: ‘He will and can get it done’ » Ramirez said she hasn’t heard from the caustic commander-in-chief’s camp about Ch--ga Tu Pelo, which is sold at liquor stores, restaurants and breweries throughout Chicagoland. The unique story behind the beer was the subject of an acclaimed documentary that premiered in 2018. Produced and directed by Jason Polevoi, the film featured an exclusive interview with iconic “Matrix” filmmaker Lilly Wachowski, who referred to the beverage as “the magical elixir.” “It’s not f--- your hair, it’s f--- you,” Ramirez said in the trailer of the 38-minute short, which garnered three Chicago/Midwest Emmy Awards nominations.

1158,"Students Build Tiny Homes in Vans and Trucks While SF Rent Soars.  A government watchdog agency, the Census Bureau's inspector general and some lawmakers have grown concerned about whether the systems are ready for prime time. Most U.S. residents can start answering the questionnaire in March..  “I must tell you, the Iowa (caucus) debacle comes to mind when I think of the census going digital,"" Eleanor Holmes Norton, the congressional delegate for the District of Columbia, said this week at a hearing on the census..  Cybersecurity is another worry. Experts consider the census to be an attractive target for anyone seeking to sow chaos and undermine confidence in the U.S. government, as Russia did in the 2016 presidential election..  In a worst-case scenario, vital records could be deleted or polluted with junk data. Even a lesser assault that interfered with online data collection could erode public confidence. In 2016, a denial-of-service attack knocked Australia’s online census offline , flooding it with junk data..  The Census Bureau says it's ready. The agency promises that responses to the questionnaire will be kept confidential through encryption, and that it's working with the Department of Homeland Security and private-sector security experts to thwart cyber attacks. To hinder illegitimate responses, the bureau is blocking foreign IP addresses and stopping bots from filling out fake responses, among many other measures..  The bureau says it has developed two secure data-collection systems, so that if one goes down, the other can substitute. Other mechanisms are in place to prevent failure and to back up essential functions..  “All systems are go,"" bureau Director Steven Dillingham said..  For the past three years, the Government Accountability Office has placed the census on its list of high-risk programs, mainly because it is relying on technology that has not been used before..  Just last week, census officials decided to use a backup data-collection system for handling the online responses. That step was taken after officials grew concerned that the primary system, developed by a third-party contractor, would not be able to handle excessive traffic. The primary system experienced performance problems when up to 400,000 people were answering questions at the same time..  The backup system, called Primus, was developed in-house and can handle up to 600,000 users at once. But it was never tested during a test-run for the decennial census in Rhode Island two years ago..  “Late design changes such as a shift from one system to another can introduce new risks during a critical moment,"" Nick Marinos, the GAO's director of information technology, testified this week at the congressional hearing. “The bureau needs to quickly ensure that the system is ready and that contingency plans are finalized to reflect this change and fully tested before going live."".  Then there's the mobile app for census takers who will be sent out to visit the homes of residents who have not filled out the forms by May. Bureau officials are still working to find out why the app sometimes needs to be restarted or reinstalled for it to work properly, according to a GAO report released this week..  In Iowa, a newly developed smartphone app was blamed for delaying the reporting of results from the first-in-the-nation presidential contest ..  The Census Bureau has not finalized its backup plans for the online questionnaire system. As of the end of last year, the bureau still had to do 191 corrective actions for cybersecurity that were considered “high risk"" or “very high risk,"" the GAO said..  Last summer, the bureau's Office of Inspector General identified several weaknesses in the agency's backup planning efforts, including the ability to recover data stored in the cloud in the event of a large-scale attack or disaster..  In the same report, the inspector general said the bureau did not securely use commercial cloud services during census preparations and found many security deficiencies that indicated the agency was “behind schedule and rushed to deploy its systems"" for the Rhode Island test-run..  The inspector general currently is conducting another audit of the bureau's information-technology security, but there's no word on when it will be finished, said Robert Johnston, the agency's chief of staff..  In Iowa, fewer than 200,000 voters picked a candidate. The census will be conducted on a much grander scale as it attempts to count residents in almost 130 million households with the help of 52 IT systems. The nationwide headcount has been touted as the largest peacetime operation the government undertakes..  An accurate count is crucial for determining how many congressional seats each state gets and the distribution of $1.5 trillion in federal spending. Respondents who do not want to answer the questionnaire online can do so by telephone or by mailing in a paper form..  Dillingham told lawmakers that the concerns raised by the inspector general had been remedied. The Census Bureau is prepared to distribute millions of paper forms in the event a catastrophe prevents people from responding online, bureau officials added..  “We can recover data if we had a breach,"" said Albert Fontenot, an associate director at the bureau. “At the worst case, we would send someone out to re-collect that data.""

1159,"We are about ready to have the 2020 census and the results will be used to draw Illinois congressional and state legislative maps for the next ten years. Under Illinois law, we have until May 3 to win approval for the Fair Maps Amendment in the Illinois General Assembly to put this constitutional amendment on the November ballot so that voters can finally change Illinois redistricting process to an independent commission drawing fair maps in open. Recent polls repeatedly show that Illinois citizens overwhelmingly support redistricting reform..  Locally, Representative Ryan Spain is the chief Republican sponsor of the Fair Maps Amendment in the House (HJRCA 41) and Democratic Sen. Dave Koehler has signed on as a co-sponsor in the Senate (SJRCA 18). Indeed, the Fair Maps Amendment has broad bipartisan legislative support. In the 2019 legislative session 3/5 of the Illinois Senate signed on as bipartisan co-sponsors yet no vote was allowed in the full senate chamber. Legislative leaders in both the House and the Senate must allow democracy to actually work in Illinois and allow a full vote in both chambers this legislative session. And, we urge Governor Pritzker to use his considerable influence and publicly follow through on his campaign pledge to support a constitutional amendment to have an independent commission draw the new legislative maps..  The Fair Maps Amendment is backed by a broad and diverse cross section of 28 organizations representing all of Illinois. Among them are AARP Illinois, the Illinois League of Women Voters, the Illinois Farm Bureau, the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce, Latino Policy Forum, Rainbow PUSH, the Chicago Urban League, and CHANGE Illinois. For a full list of coalition partners and to learn the details of the Fair Maps Amendment go to www.changeil.org We need people power to overcome entrenched political power in Illinois and invite citizens to attend two rallies in support of the Fair Map Amendment: one at Bradley University in Peoria on February 28th and one at the capitol in Springfield on March 26th (register link: changeil.salsalabs.org/advocacy) The people of Illinois understand that we can’t have honest government and hold politicians accountable if we don’t have truly competitive elections. Having politicians drawing rigged maps by choosing their own voters behind closed doors must end. It is time to restore power to the people through Fair Maps..

1160,"There’s a lot of political hot air and insincere rhetoric floating around Springfield about a proposal filed in the General Assembly this week that would allow voters to consign legislative gerrymandering to the ash heap of Illinois history..  But truer words were never spoken when Madeleine Doubek, executive director of Change Illinois, warned of the negative consequences of a failure to put this measure on the November 2020 ballot..  “The time for an end to gerrymandering is now so that we’re not saddled with another 10 years of maps that stifle competition and suppress voters’ choices,” Doubek said..  That, of course, is just what Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, and, most probably, new Senate President Don Harmon are counting on — being able to draw new state legislative district maps that “stifle competition and suppress voters’ choices” through 2032..  That’s why legislators now stand at a fork in the road. One way — preservation of the current gerrymandering process — leads to more of the same — non-competitive House and Senate elections where the winners have been pre-determined. The other offers voters the prospect of more competitive elections that feature greater choice and a potential modification of the permanent political control that feeds elected officials’ self-interests..  To qualify for the ballot, the proposed constitutional amendment — HJRCA 41 — must receive the support of three-fifths of both the House and Senate. To become part of the Illinois Constitution, the measure would have to be approved by three-fifths of voters..  If it should happen to be put to a vote, the measure is expected to pass. Public opinion polls show overwhelming support for the idea of stripping incumbent legislators of the power to draw their own districts — in effect, picking their own voters..  But the bigger question is whether either Madigan or Harmon would ever let the measure be put to a vote in the legislative bodies they control..  Further complicating the matter is that Gov. JB Pritzker has all but abandoned his support for the amendment. He claimed to back the measure when he ran for election in 2018. But he said recently he’ll review whatever maps Madigan sends him and decide whether he approves..  The amendment proposed by a coalition of Democrats and Republicans would put an end to that type of political influence..  It would require 17 members of an independent commission appointed by the state Supreme Court to draw legislative boundaries for members of the U.S. House of Representatives as well as the state House and Senate. The panel would be barred from basing their mapping decisions on partisan factors..  Democratic state Sen. Melinda Bush said it’s necessary the measure become law because “gerrymandering is ruining our democracy.”.  Gerrymandering refers to the ancient practice of drawing legislative maps in a way that gives members of the map-drawers’ party a distinctive political advantage..  As a consequence of gerrymandering in 2011, Democrats currently enjoy super-majorities in both the House and Senate..  The next round of map-drawing is scheduled for 2021 following the 2020 Census. The process is supposed to ensure that House and Senate districts are roughly equal in population, but it has historically lent itself to exploitation by self-interested legislators..  The practice is not just an issue in Illinois, but all across the nation. A number of states have revised their redistricting processes in a way that bars the relentless partisanship featured in Illinois..  While proponents of the measure face an uphill battle, their goal is to place enough pressure on fellow legislators that they will, in turn, pressure Madigan and Harmon to allow the measures to be put to a vote in the House and Senate..  It’s hard to imagine Madigan ever yielding on the issue in a sincere way. Indeed, an undetermined number of legislators who have publicly embraced reform are counting on either Madigan or Harmon to kill it behind the scenes..  That’s the way politics is played in Illinois. The state is not only relentlessly corrupt, but its leaders are also devious and cynical. Nonetheless, a bipartisan group has launched an effort to enact a meaningful and structural change in the way business is done..  If they don’t win on this measure, the people of Illinois will lose..  — The (Champaign) News-Gazette.  Choose the plan that's right for you. Digital access or digital and print delivery.

After declining for most of the year, the unemployment rate dipped to an all-time low of 3.7% in December despite a stable labor force. The tight labor market coupled with a better jobs mix is helping to preserve big gains in average hourly earnings..  Most economic gauges point to a performance gap with the Midwest and the U.S. The comprehensive count of jobs from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages indicates nonfarm employment growth over the past year was weaker than suggested in the survey estimates. Income growth in key industries such as healthcare, professional/business services and manufacturing was slower than average in 2019. The U.S. trade war with China has taken a toll on the industrial and agricultural parts of the state..  Falling mortgage rates and relatively high affordability have barely offset the effects of adverse changes to the federal tax code and weak population trends. Multifamily housing has propelled almost all the growth in residential construction during the current business cycle. Single family house prices have climbed just 1.5% over the last year, the smallest gain in the Midwest and half the national increase. Home sales are decreasing, and construction remains sluggish..  An array of factors that juiced industrial production and factory job growth in 2018 have all but played out, including federal fiscal stimulus, customers’ rush to stock up before tariffs took effect, and increased demand for oil extraction equipment. Illinois can keep advancing without a positive contribution from manufacturing, but the rest of the economy will have to do its part. Illinois will be hard-pressed to match the U.S. pace of growth in any industry, but the state will lean increasingly on healthcare and professional/business services to power job and income gains. Transportation/warehousing, a vanguard of job growth during this expansion, will expand more slowly in coming years. Consumer industries such as retail and leisure/hospitality will pitch in a bit less as the shrinking population weighs on demand. Population loss and troubled state finances will limit Illinois’ long-term potential..  * Hannah Meisel ….  The report warns lawmakers not to count on another “April surprise” — a $1.5 billion income tax windfall that allowed Pritzker to drop a plan to defer $800 million in pension payments and impose a bevy of new taxes last year. […].  Business leaders and conservatives frequently lament that the cost of doing business in Illinois is too high. But Moody’s said Illinois’ outlook is “tarnished primarily by its budget woes and weak population trends, not its high costs relative to nearby states.”.  “Business costs in the state are lower than they are nationally and have trended downward for the past few decades,” according to the report. “Overall costs are similar to those in Ohio, lower than those in Michigan and Wisconsin, but higher than those in neighboring Indiana and Iowa.”.  Moody’s analysis found that while businesses in Illinois tend to pay less in taxes and utilities, “labor is on the expensive side” in part because of the “still-high presence of unions.”.  - Posted by Rich Miller","[0.5474323034286499, 0.4525676965713501]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5474323034286499
1164,"Save.  CHARLESTON — A proposal from two Eastern Illinois University faculty members for helping get fresh produce to residents in financial need has received a financial boost..  The Illinois Innovation Network has announced that the Partners in Produce project will receive one of its seed grants. The funding is part of the network's Sustaining Illinois program that is designed to increase collaborative research among the state’s public universities, focusing on the economy, health and social well-being..  Locally, the collaboration is being led by Krystal Lynch, assistant professor of nutrition and dietetics at EIU; Melissa Maulding, dietetic internship coordinator and instructor at EIU; and Jennifer McCaffrey, assistant dean of family and consumer services at the University of Illinois and U of I Extension..  They seek to expand the Partners in Produce project that was initiated by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-Ed) program, funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and administered in Illinois by U of I Extension. Virtual livestock auction to help Coles County 4-H young people.  Lynch said Partners in Produce began last summer with U of I Extension staff seeking donations of surplus produce from growers and buyers at the Arthur Produce Auction for delivery to food pantries..  ""There are a lot of people in this area of the state that are food insecure,"" Lynch said..  Michael Gillespie, associate professor of sociology at EIU, reported last fall that U.S. Census Bureau figures show 22.4% of Coles County families are living in poverty, noting that the federal poverty threshold is $24,600 for a family of four. Gillespie also reported that 44.1 percent of Coles County families are facing food insecurity regarding their access to ""nutritionally adequate and safe foods."".  Since Partners in Produce started, Lynch said the project has delivered more than 25,000 pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables to a total of 22 food pantries in Coles, Cumberland, Douglas, Moultrie and Shelby counties. Coles County agencies seek to diversify hires.  Lynch said the Illinois Innovation Network's $30,000 grant will help fund the development of a Partners in Produce marketing campaign in 2020-2021 to help reach others with surplus produce that could be donated to pantries during the 2021 growing season. She said this outreach effort could include farmers markets, restaurants and supermarkets. She said the grant also will provide opportunities for EIU dietetics students to work with the project..  In addition, Lynch said the grant will help Partners in Produce collaborate with other area community service organizations to reach more people in need and deliver produce to them..  ""There is definitely an opportunity where we can help here. We are going to try to combine all the pieces together,"" Lynch said..  The Mattoon Community Food Center reported this spring that it distributed 438,539 pounds of food last year to people in need..  Center Executive Director Janet Clark said she appreciates Partners in Produce and any other initiatives that provide fresh fruits and vegetables to help area pantries meet the nutritional needs of their clients..  ""They are so happy to get those commodities. They are just not used to getting that type of fresh produce and it makes a tremendous difference, especially for children and our older people,"" Clark said. ""That is very valuable to us.""

Other states, including Montana and Missouri, have been dealing with potentially misleading census forms sent out by the Republican National Committee, which solicit donations for President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, according to the Washington Post . Some Alabama voters got similar mailers, according to AL.com ..  Meanwhile, Facebook recently announced its social media sites would ban posts that attempt to interfere with the count..  Oswaldo Alvarez and Marishonta Wilkerson, directors of the Illinois Census Office, said they’re not aware of deliberate misinformation being spread in the state..  Illinois gave out tens of millions of dollars to groups to encourage census participation. Alvarez said the state has been working closely with them to make sure they all have the same information — and that the information is correct..  “[It’s about] giving them the consistent, the same information from the timeline to the number of questions, to tools on how to reduce people's fears,” he said..  Jay Young, director of Common Cause Illinois — a civic engagement nonprofit, agreed that’s important. Still, he warned just because the state office and advocates like him haven’t heard of misleading information floating around, it could still be out there..  “We have to make sure that folks remain vigilant and are aware of the good information,” he said..  The U.S. Census Bureau set up an email address, rumors@census.gov, for people to report questionable information..  Meanwhile, Young said groups that want to encourage participation can find resources on the bureau’s website , the state portal Illinois Count Me In , and a national collaborative called Census Counts ..  Points Of Confusion.  The two state census directors said they have gotten questions about other points of confusion around the population count set to start this year..  This includes questions on the American Community Survey, a more in-depth questionnaire that the U.S. Census Bureau sends out throughout the year..  “When it comes to specifically the immigrant communities, the American Community Survey does ask the question of citizenship, while the actual census form will not,” Alvarez said..  A U.S. Supreme Court decision ruled the question should be left off the 2020 form , after a request by the Trump administration to include it..  Alvarez said he wanted to be sure residents understand that they’ll get reminders to fill out the form online starting in March, but if they don’t respond by early April, they’ll also get paper copies to fill out..  After that attempt, census enumerators will attempt to count the household through personal visits in May..  Young said the best way to avoid a knock at the door is to fill out the census form online..  The Census Bureau is also hiring more than 18,000 enumerators to assist in the count in Illinois. The pay is between $17 and $29 per hour..  Wilkerson said for those receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, SNAP and other public benefits, income from census work will not affect their eligibility for those programs..  The count starts in January with people in nursing homes, college dorms and other group settings. Residents can expect their first invitation to fill out the census form online in March..  In addition to giving out millions to local groups, Illinois is hiring a marketing firm to do a statewide public education campaign on the 2020 census.

Association officials noted that its recent survey found most contractors are optimistic about the dollar value of projects available and expect to keep adding workers in 2020 but they are finding it hard to fill positions and anticipate it will continue to be hard to hire employees..  Illinois didn’t fare so well, despite the national growth, with the largest percentage decline in the nation recorded in the Danville area, which lost 17 percent of its construction (along with mining and logging) employees. Of course, this is not a large market — the 100 person job loss is significant locally, but pales compared to the Chicagoland area (including Naperville and Arlington Heights) which lost 3,200 construction jobs in the year..  The most successful Illinois areas were in fact border communities shared with other states, including Davenport-Moline-Rock Island, (with Iowa) and the metropolitan St. Louis Missouri area..

Construction spending totalled $1.324 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in November, up 0.6 percent from October and up 4.1 percent from November 2018, according to estimates the U.S. Census Bureau released today. There were year-over-year increases in all major segments—public, private residential and private nonresidential..  The Dallas-Plano-Irving, Texas metro area added the most construction jobs during the past year (15,400 jobs, 10 percent), followed by Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Nev. (11,000 jobs, 17 percent). Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise had the largest percentage increase, followed by 15-percent gains in Omaha-Council Bluffs, Neb.-Iowa (4,500 jobs), Sioux Falls, S.D. (1,300 jobs) and Auburn-Opelika, Ala. (400 jobs). Construction employment set a new high for November in 71 metro areas and a new November low in six areas..  From November 2018 to November 2019, construction employment fell in 77 metros and was flat in 55. The largest declines occurred in New York City (-6,900 jobs, -4 percent) and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif. (-4,300 jobs, -4 percent). The largest percentage decreases took place in Danville, Ill. (-17 percent, -100 jobs), Fairbanks, Alaska (-12 percent, -300 jobs) and Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn. (-11 percent, -2,300 jobs)..  The new spending and employment data comes as the association’s 2020 Construction Outlook survey found that for each of 13 project types, more contractors expect an increase in 2020 than a decrease in the dollar value of projects they compete for. Three-fourths of the 956 respondents expect to add workers this year, while only 5 percent expect a decrease. However, 65 percent say it will be as hard or harder to hire workers than in 2019, when 81 percent said they had a hard time finding qualified workers to hire..  Association officials added that labor shortages are forcing contractors to boost pay, invest more in training and adopt new labor-saving technologies. But they cautioned that those changes are not enough to allow many contractors to keep pace with growing demand, noting many firms report they have raised bid prices or proposed longer construction schedules because of labor shortages..  “The single greatest threat to continued growth in the construction industry is the shortage of qualified candidates for firms to hire,” said Stephen E. Sandherr , the association’s chief executive officer. “That is why Congress and the Trump administration must act quickly to boost investments in career and technical education and allow more people with construction skills to legally enter the country.”","[0.5043952465057373, 0.4956046938896179]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5043952465057373

Whiteside County had 113 confirmed cases and eight deaths as of Friday, according to a Whiteside County’s COVID-19 page..  Whiteside’s caseload also included cases from the Joslin plant as well as another food processing plant in Ogle County, said Cheryl Lee, public health administrator and CEO of the county’s health department. She could not give exact numbers Friday, but said they were not a majority of the county's cases..  Of the county’s eight fatalities, seven were older -- 70 or above, Cory Law, the Whiteside County Health Department’s emergency response coordinator, said..  Mercer County had 13 cases reported and no deaths, Carla Ewing, the county’s health department administrator said Thursday. To her knowledge, none of those cases have required hospitalization..  “We feel very fortunate,” Ewing said..  Rock Island County had 627 positive cases and 20 deaths, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health as of Sunday..  Based on U.S. Census records for the four counties, each of their COVID-19 caseloads is less than 1 % of their population..  The health departments did, however, say it is likely there are undiagnosed cases present in their counties, and that is likely anywhere that the coronavirus is present..  Many of these may be mild or asymptomatic cases, Law and Tucker said. That is why social distancing, face masks and other requirements are in place..  “That’s what all the community mitigation’s been about,” Tucker said..  Law and Lee said that as testing becomes more available, many of these cases will likely be identified..  In Geneseo, in Henry County, city and chamber officials spoke about that community’s experience thus far..  The pandemic has been difficult for Geneseo’s businesses, Zachary Sullivan, executive director of the Geneseo chamber, said..  “I would say that retail business has been hit the worst,” Sullivan said..  The chamber has about 200 members, many of them small businesses often with 10 or fewer employees, he said. They are trying to figure out how they will make ends meet..  “I think for every city, that’s the biggest problem,” JoAnn Hollenkamp, Geneseo’s city administrator, said..  Many have reduced hours, or had to lay employees off or send them on furlough, he said..  As of Thursday, he only knew of one business that was expecting to close permanently, but there was concern more might shutter if coronavirus-related issues continue..  They are handling the social distancing and cleaning requirements, he said. They are doing business through curbside transactions and other similar transactions that limit interaction..  Where they have needed help is navigating the various state and federal programs that have been put in place to help businesses stay afloat, Sullivan said..  The chamber has also been working to direct more traffic to its members’ social media pages and websites to encourage online sales, he said..  The city is also trying to help where it can -- setting up payment plans for business utility bills, for instance, Hollenkamp said..  Hollenkamp and Sullivan said Geneseo is already preparing a plan for more open commerce within public health and state pandemic guidelines in anticipation of some of the restrictions being loosened soon..  Sterling, in Whiteside County, is feeling a similar crunch, Mayor Skip Lee said on Friday..  Shutting down has been catastrophic for Sterling’s small businesses, he said..  He and Hollenkamp said the residents of their cities have begun to chafe under the mitigation restrictions as the pandemic continues and fear the effects of continued restrictions..  “There’s just that general frustration as to where this ship is going,” Skip Lee said..  They are also still afraid of the virus, Hollenkamp said..  “As a whole, people are scared, they are worried, they are depressed,” Hollenkamp said..

1180,"UBS, the Swiss bank, examined home prices across prominent global cities, including four in the U.S., and out of 24 analyzed, only one was a bargain: Chicago..  What do a bunch of Swiss bankers know that nearly 1 million people who have moved out of Chicago since 1950 don’t?.  Maybe it’s an appreciation of cities on lakes. The UBS headquarters is a 10-minute walk from Lake Zurich. But the bank’s annual Global Real Estate Bubble Index, followed by lenders, multinational companies and investors, has for years shown housing prices in some global cities soaring beyond apparent reason. Prices in Munich, Toronto, Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Vancouver and Paris were well into bubble risk when the most recent list was assembled, and most others on the list were considered overvalued..  Chicago homes, remarkably, cost the same as they did 20 years ago on an inflation-adjusted basis. And yet the city checks the other boxes to qualify for inclusion on a global-cities list: top universities, world class museums, an innovative and eclectic restaurant scene, commanding architecture and an extensive public transit system. It’s the business and cultural hub of the American Midwest, though often overlooked by the Coastal Elite..  UBS calculates that a skilled service worker must work three years to pay for a 650-square-foot apartment near the city center in Chicago. In New York, it takes 11 years; in Paris, 15 years; in Hong Kong, 21 years..  What is peculiar to Chicago that accounts for its housing being so cheap? Population loss — though not as severe as seen in Detroit or St. Louis — is a big factor. Going from 3.6 million city residents in 1950 to 2.7 million today lessened demand for existing and new housing. Economic growth lags that of major coastal cities. There’s also a local and state unfunded pension time bomb — the worst in the country — overhanging civic finances and accounting for large property tax increases past and future. A long history of local and state political corruption has prevented solutions to that and other problems. And crime hasn’t shown the enormous decreases enjoyed by New York and Los Angeles in recent years..  There are also problems Chicago shares with other big cities. Among them, its school system does a great job educating elite students, but the rank-and-file schools often fail those who attend. College admission officers warm immediately to graduates of Northside College Preparatory High School but, according to its own ratings, Chicago Public Schools has 124 schools that aren’t in good standing, including 55 that need “intensive support.”.  So, like many other big cities, Chicago is often a great place to live for those who can afford to enjoy its many attractions and navigate its patchy education and public safety realms, and a very different and difficult city for others. Its south and west sides have particularly suffered..  Chicago offers close-in neighborhood living, in both single-family homes and apartments and condos, at a fraction of the cost one would pay in major coastal cities. In Bucktown and Wicker Park, just four stops out from the Loop on the L’s Blue Line, the median home price is below just $500,000. The area is home to a lively restaurant and bar scene. Its housing stock is a mix of 100-year-old three-flats, typically rehabbed multiple times; modest single-family homes of a similar vintage; some larger apartment and condo developments; and, during the past 30 years, teardowns that are often very large, some across multiple lots. The area is fabulously walkable and home to the elevated 606 walkway..  The South Loop has been transformed from warehouse, light manufacturing and patches of housing into a forest of high-rise and mid-rise condo and apartment structures. It abuts beautiful Grant Park, the city’s Museum Campus and the lakefront. Median home prices below $500,000 as well as $1 million-plus condos now abound..  Other close-in neighborhoods offer similar bargains, relative to other global cities. Overall, Chicago’s median single-family home price is $299,900. Across the city, housing prices are more closely aligned to incomes than in coastal cities..  So, if the Chicago winter freaks you out — and it does many — enjoying a far lower cost of living there could allow for lengthy winter breaks, and perhaps a snowbird’s condo in Florida or Arizona..  As companies loosen up and allow more employees to work remotely, trading Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York or Boston for Chicago could mean an immediate and substantial raise in disposable income. And some will find they’ve actually traded up.","[0.5097722411155701, 0.49022775888442993]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5097722411155701

1182,"Most Illinois metros smaller today than 10 years ago Corina Curry Rockford Register Star @corinacurry Wednesday Jun 10, 2020 at 9:00 AM Population loss hitting downstate manufacturing-based cities harder than others.  Of the nearly 30 Illinois cities with populations over 50,000, only about one-third can claim more residents today than in 2010..  And many of those undergoing the largest population declines are cities that have long struggled to redefine themselves after the decline of their manufacturing and industrial bases — cities like Decatur, which is third in the nation in 10-year population loss, and Rockford, which is 15th, according to newly released U.S. Census population estimates..  Decatur has shrunk by 7.1%, or nearly 5,400 people. Rockford is down 5%, or nearly 7,700 people..  During the past 10 years, Rockford — the city once known as the screw capital of the world and the second-largest city in Illinois outside Chicago — fell from the third-largest community to the fifth..  And other larger communities that anchor downstate Illinois are facing a similar fate. Springfield, No. 6 in the state, has 2.4% fewer people than it did in 2010, and Peoria, No. 8, is 4.1% smaller..  Experts say the reasons are varied. The decline of manufacturing means there are fewer jobs that can support a family, which leads to fewer and smaller families. A smaller job market forces young people to look elsewhere for opportunities. A beleaguered business climate, high tax rates, high crime and poorly performing schools — real or perceived — all play a role..  ""We are in a state where a number of conditions work against population retention,"" said Bob Evans, associate professor of economics and political science at Rockford University. ""And then there are some of those conditions that impose themselves more brutally in certain areas."".  The decline of industry and the rise of technology have dealt a double whammy of sorts to some communities, Evans said..  ""For decades, employment in the U.S. has been shifting from industry to service,"" he said. ""Places like Rockford were caught in the middle of that — on the down slide of manufacturing jobs but not easily replacing those jobs with service jobs."".  Much in the same way that Naperville knocked cities like Rockford and Joliet out of their higher rankings in Illinois, Chicago is on track to face a similar fate at the hands of Houston..  Chicago’s population has remained relatively flat at about 2.7 million over the past 10 years, whereas Houston has gone from about 2.1 million people in 2010 to 2.3 million in 2019..  In the end, long-term population loss isn’t just a problem for cities like Decatur, Rockford and Springfield, experts say. It could negatively affect entire regions and the state..  According to the estimates, Illinois has about 160,000 fewer residents today compared to 2010, a 1.2% decline..  If those estimates hold true when the 2020 census is complete, it could mean a smaller voice in Washington and fewer federal funds..  ""One of the biggest concerns is going to be what that means to the political representation and federal funding,"" said Brian Harger, a program coordinator with Northern Illinois University’s Illinois Health Information Technology Regional Extension Center..  ""We may lose one or two seats in Congress, which lowers our influence. Most state and federal aid programs are based on population. So fewer people could mean less funding."".  Programs that distribute funds based on census population data include everything from Medicaid and public housing to road construction..  While census estimates give the public an indication of how communities are changing, they are not used to determine congressional representation or the distribution of federal dollars. The country relies on the 10-year, often called the decennial census, to calculate those changes..  In the Rockford area, the Region 1 Planning Council is spearheading efforts to make sure as many people as possible participate in the 2020 count..  ""Most federal money comes into areas of the state based on population,"" said Mike Dunn Jr., executive director of Region 1. ""Once you lock in to that 10-year number, you now have basically determined your share of federal funding for health care, transportation, housing, public safety ... All of that is dictated by your population."".  Making sure that every area resident and Illinoisan is counted this year is crucial for the state’s economic future, Dunn said..  ""Everybody has an undercount,"" he said. ""So when you’re already going to lose population, you want to minimize that undercount. ... Most of the states are gaining people. If you are one of those states losing people, like Illinois, an undercount is devastating."".

There is always room to improve but things have gotten so much better in the last 50 years. With that statement you demonstrate you are unaware or ignoring facts, and subsequently lose the argument. ….  “It’s not skin color that holds people back but there are other realities that do.

The proper response to my reader, however, is setting the record straight..  First, there’s no national database for police violence, so claims to “actual statistics” are inherently dubious. Second, 2019 Census estimates put America’s population at 76.5% “white alone” and 13.4% “black or African American alone,” meaning any data set not accounting for per capita rates is intentionally misleading..  Although lacking certainty, leading estimates say police fatally shot more than 5,000 people from 2015-2019. (Whether that’s tolerable, regardless of demographics, is another vital discussion.) The Officer Down Memorial Page , reports 963 line of duty deaths in the same span. Dangerous, but not disproportionate..  The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded 5,250 fatal work injuries in 2018, with 108 of those being police or sheriff’s patrol officers (up 14% from 2017). ODMP’s 2018 count was 185, which includes 9/11-related cancer (46) and heart attacks (20)..  Heavy truck drivers accounted for 831 fatalities in 2018, most of any job. The deadliest profession per capita was logging, with nearly 100 deaths per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers. Other industries more deadly than police work include fishing, aviation, roofing, waste hauling, agriculture, structural iron and steel and first-line supervisors of construction, extraction and landscaping..  Further, fatalities among Black workers jumped 16 percent in 2018, yielding the largest number since 1999. The fatal injury rate also increased. Those numbers point to the larger argument: reforms addressing Black Lives Matter concerns far exceed policing to incorporate society at large..

1190,"I've discussed the Mississippian culture of North America whose capital at its Y1K peak was at Cahokia, now in Southern Illinois, several times at this blog, which a press release at Science Daily sums up as follows: In its heyday in the 1100s, Cahokia -- located in what is now southern Illinois -- was the center for Mississippian culture and home to tens of thousands of Native Americans who farmed, fished, traded and built giant ritual mounds. By the 1400s, Cahokia had been abandoned due to floods, droughts, resource scarcity and other drivers of depopulation. . . . [M]any studies have focused on the reasons for Cahokia's decline, few have looked at the region following the exodus of Mississippians, whose culture is estimated to have spread through the Midwestern, Southeastern and Eastern United States from 700 A.D. to the 1500s. But, a new study examines what happened a century after it collapsed. In a nutshell, after a century or so of abandonment, the Native American collection of tribes called the Illinois Confederation moved in for a couple of hundred years until their smaller scale and less urban civilization also collapsed. As the same press release explains (emphasis added): [A] fresh wave of Native Americans repopulated the region in the 1500s and kept a steady presence there through the 1700s, when migrations, warfare, disease and environmental change led to a reduction in the local population . . . . [R]esearchers . . . analyzed fossil pollen, the remnants of ancient feces, charcoal and other clues to reconstruct a post-Mississippian lifestyle. Their evidence paints a picture of communities built around maize farming, bison hunting and possibly even controlled burning in the grasslands, which is consistent with the practices of a network of tribes known as the Illinois Confederation. Unlike the Mississippians who were firmly rooted in the Cahokia metropolis, the Illinois Confederation tribe members roamed further afield, tending small farms and gardens, hunting game and breaking off into smaller groups when resources became scarce[.] The press release ""politely"" understates the obvious historical fact that the collapse of the Illinois Confederation was proximately caused by the influx of colonists and pioneers with roots in Europe under the organizing principles of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 adopted under the Articles of Confederation that were in place prior to the adoption of the current United States Constitution in 1789..  There were European hunters, trappers and explorers on the grounds in this part of North American (mostly French) for essentially all of the period during which the Illinois Confederation, which flourished in the post-Columbian era. But, they were thin on the ground and could co-exist with the existing inhabitants, while the settlers who began to move to Southern Illinois in the late 18th century were much more disruptive to the way of life of the existing inhabitants and over the course of a century more or less completely displaced and replaced them..  The Illinois Confederation included the Miami Indians after whom Miami University of Ohio (in and around which I grew up) and the nearby Miami River are named. The Miami Indians who were recently departed when Miami University was founded in the year 1809, but the university now has a treaty relationship with the modern Miami Indian tribe..  The paper and its abstract are as follows (emphasis added):.  The occupation history of the Cahokia archaeological complex (ca. AD 1050–1400) has received significant academic attention for decades, but the subsequent repopulation of the region by indigenous peoples is poorly understood. This study presents demographic trends from a fecal stanol population reconstruction of Horseshoe Lake, Illinois, along with information from archaeological, historical, and environmental sources to provide an interpretation of post-Mississippian population change in the Cahokia region. Fecal stanol data indicate that the Cahokia region reached a population minimum by approximately AD 1400, regional population had rebounded by AD 1500, a population maximum was reached by AD 1650, and population declined again by AD 1700. The indigenous repopulation of the area coincides with environmental changes conducive to maize-based agriculture and bison-hunting subsistence practices of the Illinois Confederation. The subsequent regional depopulation corresponds to a complicated period of warfare, epidemic disease, Christianization, population movement, and environmental change in the eighteenth century. The recognition of a post-Mississippian indigenous population helps shape a narrative of Native American persistence over Native American disappearance. A.J. White, Samuel E.

1191,"For the past six years, the state of Illinois has experienced a decline in its population. However, this year, the University managed to receive the highest freshman class in history. Using new data from the Internal Revenue Service, the Illinois Policy Institute discovered “while residents leaving the state come from all income brackets, Illinois is losing more than twice as many wealthy residents as it is attracting,” according to a press release from the Illinois Policy Institute. The Illinois Policy Institute is a nonpartisan research organization that promotes smaller government and free-market principles. Bryce Hill, policy analyst for the Illinois Policy Institute, states the decrease in population will affect Illinois’ economy. “We are already losing our highest-earning residents at the fastest rate, and states who have chosen to pursue progressive income tax hikes have actually seen the migration of higher-earning residents,” Hill said. “This means working for the middle class is more likely to be asked to pay more in income taxes if that happens in Illinois.” According to Hill, the population decline is harmful to Illinois because it is increasing problems the government is already dealing with. “We have a lot of fixed costs that are independent without the population, meaning we are going to have to pay for them without reforms,” Hill said. “A business will less likely create jobs.” Hill said although the University’s enrollment has been increasing in the past decade, the state’s total college enrollment has been declining since 2010. “Part of the reason is that there are fewer young people in the state to begin with as a result of demographic changes in the population and the fact we are losing citizens due to outmigration,” Hill said. “So the University won’t be able to grow if the student pool is shrinking.” Rolf Joseph Pendall, professor and head of the Department of Urban & Regional Planning, said he also believes it is important to discuss the decline in population within the state of Illinois. Pendall said the reason why people leave Illinois is because of economic opportunity elsewhere and family. “Those seem to be the big reasons,” Pendall said. “There’s also a long-term trend in the United States that encourages people to move from colder states to warmer states, but that’s also true with business.” According to Pendall, there is a declining number of undergraduate students ages 18 – 23 and graduate students ages 24 – 30 in Illinois. “Those numbers who live in Illinois have gone down, but the number of international students who study in Illinois is still pretty strong,” Pendall said. Dan Mann, associate provost for enrollment management, states the University is concerned about people leaving the state of Illinois. When students and families leave, they are potentially taking college-age students. “When there are fewer students in the state, we have to compete harder to get them to come here,” Mann said. “We are going to work very hard to try to make sure that we are bringing in the class size that the campus wants.” Methods the University approaches in terms of recruiting students include participating in high school and college fairs as well as recruitment fairs for transfer students in community colleges, Mann said. Mann said the University is also aware of the future change in demographics throughout the country that will be occurring in 2025 due to a significant dropout rate of high school graduates in the country. “Schools and states in the Midwest are going to see bigger declines (than) in other parts of the country,” Mann said. “So we are preparing for that and talking about strategies that we can employ to try and make sure that we maintain the enrollment in the levels that we desire.” Hill said he hopes raising awareness of Illinois’ outmigration problem will create a positive effect for everyone. “I hope that increasing awareness on the population decline will result in real reforms that can actually turn the state around and become a beacon of prosperity and spur growth that is to be good for state institutions and universities … (and) the economy, in general,” Hill said.","[0.5176656246185303, 0.48233431577682495]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5176656246185303

We found a clear explanation for viewing the rate of infections per 100,000 comes from Indiana University at Bloomington : “There may or may not be 100,000 residents in the county under review, but multiplying the result by 100,000 makes that rate comparable with counties with more than 100,000 or less than 100,000.”.  “It is customary to use rates per 100,000 population for deaths and rates per 1,000 population for live births,” our source at Indiana University says..  So, none of the cities, towns, and villages we survey have 100,000 residents, but by using the rate per 100,000, we are able to compare apples to apples, so to speak, as if every town did have 100,000 residents..  eNews Park Forest will continue to track the effects the COVID-19 pandemic has on our region..

1200,"A congressional district in southern Illinois is expected to disappear following the 2020 census, raising concerns from about the redistricting process that determines the number of seats a state gets in Congress..  The 15th Congressional District, which stretches across nearly 15,000 square miles of southern and central Illinois, will most likely be eliminated after the 2020 census because its population has been steadily dwindling, according to experts..  U.S. Census Bureau data shows that from 2013 to 2018, the district’s population dropped by about 14,000, to 690,000 — jeopardizing a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives because a congressional district must have roughly 710,000 residents..  Population drops allow lawmakers, particularly those in the majority party of a state, to redraw congressional district maps in a process called redistricting. In Illinois, Democrats dominate both the General Assembly and the governor’s office, empowering them to map the entire state’s congressional districts. Map drawing is slated to begin next year..  The redistricting calculus means that while a Republican candidate is expected to take the conservative district in November, the winner will likely serve just one term, the Belleville News-Democrat reported..  U.S. Rep. John Shimkus who currently represents the 15th District already declined to run for reelection after more than 20 years in Congress..  Sarah Drone, an Avon saleswoman from Harrisburg in southeastern Illinois, said that’s frustrating because rural cities like hers need representatives to help create more jobs and stop even more population loss..  “We’re already underrepresented around here, and we need more representation in Congress,” said Drone, who identifies as an independent. “But we’re used to it.”.  If the 15th District is eliminated, Democrats can draw a map that makes one of the other Republican southern districts, the 12th or the 13th, more competitive in elections, according to John Jackson, a visiting professor at the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute..  While U.S. Rep. Mike Bost, R-Murphysboro, has a firm hold on the 12th District, which covers most of deep southern Illinois, Republican U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis from Taylorville faces a close race in November..  “It’s going to be difficult for the Democrats to draw a map in these three districts that clearly advantages them,” Jackson explained. “They will look to places like Belleville and East St. Louis where there’s Democratic strength and they will try to get as many Democrats in (one district) as they can.”.  State Senate Minority Leader Bill Brady, a Republican from Bloomington, said he hopes Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker will support a joint resolution amendment that would change the Illinois constitution’s provisions on redistricting. The measure, which attracted broad bipartisan support, would make the mapping process fairer, Brady argued..  “The only way the governor can live up to his commitment and perception as well as reality is to help us push for fair maps,” Brady said.

1202,"(This article was published first at Illinois Policy Institute )..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker and other proponents of his proposed $3 billion “fair tax” claim increasing Springfield’s power to set multiple tax rates will bring much-needed tax relief to low- and middle-income families..  That isn’t the case. The median family in Illinois is likely to pay $244 more in state and local taxes next year regardless of any “relief” from a progressive income tax..  That’s because the costs that are driving up state and local budgets are not being reformed. They have led to constant tax increases during the past decade, and more are projected that a “fair tax” will not fix..  Illinois property taxes are already second-highest in the nation. Those, plus expected increases in consumption, based on 20-year historical averages, will likely mean the typical family will pay an extra $244 in state and local taxes if the “fair tax” passes..  Breaking that down, the median family earns $87,771 per year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. They can expect to pay an extra $106 to state and local governments for sales and excise taxes in 2021. They will also pay $183 more in property taxes. The “fair tax” relief promised by Pritzker would only reduce their state income taxes by $45..  That results in $244 more taken from that median family, which pushes their combined state and local tax burden above $10,600..  But that estimate doesn’t account for the $150 increase in gas taxes and vehicle registration fees imposed by the state in 2019. Even if Illinois families are able to take advantage of expanded child and property tax credits, the increased cost of owning a vehicle in Illinois will raise their taxes even more.

The grand total: $314 (or more, if the family cannot claim the credits)..  Proponents of the “fair tax” tout it as a way to offer tax relief to struggling families, but the reality is average Illinoisans can expect to pay more in state and local taxes despite the small break offered by the initial rates. After voters give state lawmakers the power to change those rates, a simple majority vote could raise taxes by any amount on any group whenever state leaders want more money..  So long as state lawmakers refuse to consider constitutional pension and other spending reforms, Illinoisans will continuously be asked to pay more. The longer reforms are delayed, the more likely middle-class taxpayers will be hit with an income tax hike regardless of whether voters let lawmakers create progressive income tax rates..  The “fair tax” isn’t about reducing taxes for the middle-class, it’s about eliminating the state constitution’s built-in protection against tax hikes. It’s about opening the door for a litany of new taxes such as city income taxes and retirement taxes.

1204,"Chicago suburb will use recreational marijuana sales tax proceeds to fund local reparations program Genevieve Bookwalter Pioneer Press Save.  CHICAGO — Evanston aldermen on Monday approved directing all sales tax revenue collected from recreational marijuana purchases to a fund that will establish a local reparations program..  Officials say the program will help the city’s black population stay in Evanston while also providing training for jobs and other benefits..  “We can implement funding to directly invest in black Evanston,” said Ald. Robin Rue Simmons, 5th Ward, who proposed the reparations bill..  While Evanston officials have voted to permit, tax and appropriate money from recreational marijuana sales, many other suburbs have voted not to allow recreational marijuana dispensaries to open when the businesses become legal next year under state law..  Evanston leaders say they see the dispensaries as an opportunity to pay for a local reparations program that would address the lingering institutional effects of slavery and discrimination. The proposal passed 8-1, with Ald. Tom Suffredin, 6th Ward, voting against it..  Simmons said the source of the money was especially appropriate, as many black residents were victims of the “war on drugs” and spent time in jail for smoking marijuana, a substance that in specific quantities will now be permitted in Illinois..  The tax on marijuana will “be invested in the community it unfairly policed and damaged,” Simmons said..  A committee of residents is currently examining ways to spend the money and how to best support the black community through housing, education and economic incentives. The fund will be capped at $10 million, according to city of Evanston staff reports. City estimates project the marijuana tax could generate $500,000 to $750,000 per year..  “This is a really special moment in the city of Evanston and also in the country,” said Ald. Peter Braithwaite, 2nd Ward..  Community members attending the meeting praised the effort and thanked the council for investing in residents who were harmed by discriminatory housing and other past policies..  “I support the approval of the ordinance for the city of Evanston to commit all of the anticipated tax revenue from the recreational marijuana businesses, to support work aimed at intentionally repairing harms done to the black community from policies and practices in so many different areas,” said Oliver Ruff, a retired teacher and Evanston resident..  Simmons’ proposal came as Evanston’s black population decreased from 22.5% of the population in 2000 to 16.9% in 2017, according to U.S. Census data..  The idea that the United States should make reparations to the descendants of slaves has been part of the national conversation since the slave trade ended, but there has been little formal action and much debate. Questions include what form reparations should take, and what institutions or individuals should make them..  Frustrated by the lack of action at the national level, Rue Simmons has said she believed a local reparations program could gain traction quickly and have a more immediate impact..

1206,"Chicago suburb to use marijuana sales tax to fund local reparations program Wed, 11/27/2019 - 11:40am GENEVIEVE BOOKWALTER Pioneer Press.  CHICAGO — Evanston aldermen on Monday approved directing all sales tax revenue collected from recreational marijuana purchases to a fund that will establish a local reparations program..  Officials say the program will help the city’s black population stay in Evanston while also providing training for jobs and other benefits..  “We can implement funding to directly invest in black Evanston,” said Ald. Robin Rue Simmons, 5th Ward, who proposed the reparations bill..  While Evanston officials have voted to permit, tax and appropriate money from recreational marijuana sales, many other suburbs have voted not to allow recreational marijuana dispensaries to open when the businesses become legal next year under state law..  Evanston leaders say they see the dispensaries as an opportunity to pay for a local reparations program that would address the lingering institutional effects of slavery and discrimination. The proposal passed 8-1, with Ald. Tom Suffredin, 6th Ward, voting against it..  Simmons said the source of the money was especially appropriate, as many black residents were victims of the “war on drugs” and spent time in jail for smoking marijuana, a substance that in specific quantities will now be permitted in Illinois..  The tax on marijuana will “be invested in the community it unfairly policed and damaged,” Simmons said..  A committee of residents is currently examining ways to spend the money and how to best support the black community through housing, education and economic incentives. The fund will be capped at $10 million, according to city of Evanston staff reports. City estimates project the marijuana tax could generate $500,000 to $750,000 per year..  “This is a really special moment in the city of Evanston and also in the country,” said Ald. Peter Braithwaite, 2nd Ward..  Community members attending the meeting praised the effort and thanked the council for investing in residents who were harmed by discriminatory housing and other past policies..  “I support the approval of the ordinance for the city of Evanston to commit all of the anticipated tax revenue from the recreational marijuana businesses, to support work aimed at intentionally repairing harms done to the black community from policies and practices in so many different areas,” said Oliver Ruff, a retired teacher and Evanston resident..  Simmons’ proposal came as Evanston’s black population decreased from 22.5% of the population in 2000 to 16.9% in 2017, according to U.S. Census data..  The idea that the United States should make reparations to the descendants of slaves has been part of the national conversation since the slave trade ended, but there has been little formal action and much debate. Questions include what form reparations should take, and what institutions or individuals should make them..  Frustrated by the lack of action at the national level, Rue Simmons has said she believed a local reparations program could gain traction quickly and have a more immediate impact..

1221,"Chicago Tribune | Sep 16, 2020 at 5:30 AM Few things in life are as fun as getting E. Faye Butler talking about a character she is playing. Actually, strike that. The venerable Chicago and East Coast star does not so much play characters as immerse herself in them. Advertisement She was that way with Mama Rose of “Gypsy” at Porchlight Music Theatre and the results were spectacular . Now she has turned her attention to Fannie Lou Hamer. And to see what she is doing with “Fannie Lou Hamer: Speak On It!,” you’ll have to catch the new mobile stage cruising the neighborhoods of Chicago with gas pumped by the Goodman Theatre. And you’ll need to bring your lawn chair to a Chicago park for what will be, to the best of my knowledge, the first Actors’ Equity-sanctioned Chicago production since the pandemic closures of last March. Advertisement “Fannie is an unsung hero of the civil rights movement who got lost in the shuffle,” Butler said over the phone this week, as she unspooled Hamer’s biography a mile a minute. “We forget about the women who also fought in that battle. She had a sixth-grade education. But she had the power of magnitude that drew people to her and she made the movement the passion of her life. She would stand up and speak from the heart.” Hamer, who lived from 1917 to 1977, grew up desperately poor as the 20th child of Mississippi sharecroppers. Her relative anonymity compared to some of the other leaders of the movement perhaps also flows from her relatively short lifespan (she suffered from long-declining health due to contracting polio as a child and later being sterilized without her knowledge), and her age at the time of the movement. When the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee found her in her home town of Mound Bayou, Miss., and pointed out her right to vote, Hamer already was in her mid-40s. She would go to become one of the oldest members of that committee and would later march with Andrew Young and Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1966 March Against Fear in Mississippi. In 1968, Hamer spoke on behalf of the Alabama delegation at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, although the Democratic Party made attempts to prevent her speech from being widely broadcast to Americans. Her most famous quote? “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.” It is inscribed on her tombstone. There are several books about Hamer, including Kay Mills' “The Little Light of Mine,” which appears to have been optioned for a film, but she has largely gone unnoticed to date by Hollywood and Netflix. E. Faye Butler (as Fannie Lou Hamer) and music director Felton Offard in Goodman Theatre rehearsals for ""Fannie Lou Hamer, Speak On It!"" by Cheryl L. West. (Goodman photo) “Fannie” is penned by Cheryl L. West, a veteran Seattle-based writer I’ve known and admired for a quarter century or more, and whose past works include “ Pullman Porter Blues ,” “Jar the Floor” “Puddin’ ‘n Pete” and the Chicago-set “Holiday Heart,” which I remember reviewing at the Cleveland Playhouse, many moons ago. Many of West’s plays have been on historical themes. “It is such a blessing,” West said in a telephone interview Tuesday, “to honor this incredible woman, to bring her to my home city of Chicago, and do so at a time we all need hope and to be inspired.” The show on offer now is essentially a free, outdoor, 40-minute cutting of a one-woman show that was originally intended to be 90 minutes (that longer production still is on the docket for whenever indoor theater returns to the City of Chicago). West said the Chicago Park District had imposed other rules, including nixing the Hamer character teaching the audience her favorite freedom songs, collective singing being discouraged in the COVID era, even outdoors. That said, Butler will sing the songs with the audience at a safe distance. There are to be capacity controls in the roped-off areas in front of the stage, but people also will be able to visit the park as normal and, from afar, watch as little or as much of the performance as they wish. “I am thinking of it as being very in the spirit of Fannie,” West said, “a woman who knocked on a lot of doors, who believed very much in the United States and who believed that together we could do so many great things if we could get rid of this division based on things that don’t really matter.” “We want people to be involved,” West said. “We want this to be theater for the people.” West also said that census takers will be present alongside the show, and there will be a chance to register to vote (a Goodman Theatre spokesperson said the League of Women Voters is one of the partners in the project). I hope to be there Friday at Abbott Park. Other neighborhoods on the schedule include West Rogers Park, Bronzeville, Portage Park, Austin and North Lawndale. The Goodman has not previously done anything similar to this. Butler said that the whole thing already was giving her goosebumps.

1222,"NEW YORK- College of DuPage and XBRL US, a nonprofit standards organization, jointly stated today that College of DuPage, located in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, is the first public community college to publish their financial statements in standardized XBRL format on their website, using the XBRL US CAFR Taxonomy. View the College of DuPage financials: https://www.cod.edu/about/administration/planning_and_reporting_documents/xbrl-financial-statements.aspx.  College of DuPage also announced plans to develop a data repository to house financials from other Illinois-based community colleges. The repository will be available on the College’s website. Early adopters include Oakton Community College in Des Plaines, Illinois, which has agreed to also post their financials in machine-readable, standardized format. Their financials will be the first to be hosted on the new College of DuPage repository..  “As educators, we believe that knowledge is transformative. Financials prepared in structured, machine-readable format give citizens, investors, and other government agencies the power to make decisions based on more timely, accessible data,” said Brian Caputo, Ph.D., C.P.A., President, College of DuPage. “We encourage other community colleges in Illinois to join us in this move to more open and transparent financial data.”.  The financials were prepared using the XBRL US CAFR Taxonomy, with XBRL preparation tools contributed by Iris Business Services LLC. The CAFR Taxonomy was created by the XBRL US Standard Government Reporting Working Group, and was developed as a demonstration to illustrate how government reporting can be improved through data standards, and contains XBRL concepts that can be used to prepare seven financial statements, two footnotes, and certain schedules in the Single Audit Report. Review the draft taxonomy: https://xbrl.us/xbrl-taxonomy/2020-cafr/.  Approximately 30,000 state and local governments in the United States produce audited financial reports annually. Because this data is not standardized or machine-readable, the ability to aggregate data and compare the financial performance of governmental entities is limited. Recently, there has been local government action towards the use of data standards for municipal reporting. The state of Florida adopted XBRL for local government reporting in March 2018, with the passage of House Bill 1073 . The state of Illinois introduced House Resolution 0703 on February 4, 2020, to encourage the use of XBRL for financial reporting by local governments within the state..  Members of the XBRL US State and Local Working Group include DataTracks, Gray CPA Consulting, Intrinio, IRIS Business Services LLC, Middle Tennessee State University, Northern Illinois University, Novaworks LLC, Reason Foundation, Thales Consulting (CAFROnline), Truth In Accounting, the University of South Florida, and Workiva, Inc. Observers to the Working Group include NASACT (the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers) and the U.S. Census Bureau, among other organizations..  About the College of DuPage.  College of DuPage is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Serving approximately 21,000 students each term, College of DuPage is the largest public community college in the state of Illinois. The College grants seven associate degrees and offers more than 170 career and technical certificates in over 50 areas of study..  About XBRL US.  XBRL US is the non-profit consortium for XBRL business reporting standards in the US and represents the business information supply chain. Its mission is to support the implementation of business reporting standards through the development of taxonomies for use by US public and private sectors, with a goal of interoperability between sectors, and promoting XBRL adoption through marketplace collaboration. XBRL US has built standards for government agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Energy, as well as industry sponsored standards for surety insurance, municipal government reporting, and corporate actions. http://xbrl.us.

Caucus members are hosting a series of committees on the various pillars ahead of the fall veto session, which is scheduled Nov. 17 to Nov. 19 and Dec. 1 to Dec. 3. Caucus Chair Kimberly Lightford, a Maywood Democrat and Senate Majority leader, said Black Caucus members would like to take the whole session to address items on their agenda..  “Black people matter,” state Rep. Will Davis, a Hazel Crest Democrat and member of a House education appropriations committee, said during the news conference at Chicago State University. “The education of young Black boys and Black girls matters.”.  Davis, Lightford and State Rep. Carol Ammons, D-Urbana, called disparity in education the most important consequence of systemic racism to be addressed by the caucus..  Robin Steans, president of Advance Illinois, a policy organization devoted to improving public education outcomes, said at the news conference, “There is no way to undo centuries of systemic racism without addressing education.”.  Due to economic and resource imbalances deeply embedded in communities by legal and de facto discrimination and disinvestment, “access to high-quality education from birth to career” is one of the most proven methods of leveling the playing field, according to Steans..  The afternoon committee meeting on the issue was a joint hearing of the Senate Education and Higher Education committees..  Advocates testified that income, health outcomes and crime rates of a given area can all be tied to the availability and access to quality education, as well as other factors such as accessible and affordable child care and after-school services. In Illinois, Steans said, census tracts with a high percentage of Black residents tended to have schools that received fewer resources, had more vacant teacher positions and fewer counselors than other communities. Senate committee focuses on criminal sentencing reforms in Illinois.  Potential actions to reverse these trends include, according to advocates, significant financial investment to provide affordable child care, pre-kindergarten education, literacy programs and other measures focused to give preference to low-income students and families that need resources the most..  Lightford also spoke to the importance of education and gave a tearful response when asked about her inspirations as a child..  “I come from an abusive home and I don’t know that I had inspiration, I just knew that I needed to pray,” she said..  Lightford said her mother, grandmother and great-grandmother were all homemakers with limited education. Thanks to “some of the best teachers” in grammar school who looked like and could relate to her, as well as the support of her mother to receive a quality education, Lightford said, she was the first in her family to receive a college degree..  During the news conference, Davis said the potentially expensive measures will need the support of his colleagues outside of the Black Caucus..  “While they’re saying they’re with us now, when the rubber hits the road we’ll see exactly where they are,” he said, without naming any specific colleagues. “They just have no desire to see the equity that needs to come about by assisting the Black community.”.  Democratic legislative leaders Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, and House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, have both issued public statements in support of the Black Caucus’ legislative agenda..  Lightford said she was “encouraged” by the support for the agenda she’s seen outside of the Black Caucus..  “I think change is not something always easily and readily received … You have to have courage to make a change,” she said..  The need to inform their colleagues is one of the reasons the caucus has planned eight subject matter hearings — two for each pillar — in the General Assembly ahead of the fall veto session. Illinois ‘reviewing questions’ before setting cannabis dispensary license lottery date.  “It’s our responsibility as Black Caucus members to explain that (Black) experience to our colleagues via experts, data, research, knowledge,” Lightford said. “The things that we know ‘cause we live it, we need to make sure they understand.”.  Wednesday’s Senate committee heard the testimony of experts on early childhood education funding and access to early literacy programs. Witness organizations included the Ounce of Prevention Fund, Voices for Illinois Children, Illinois Action for Children and Advance Illinois..  Witnesses agreed on the prevalence of child poverty in Illinois, its crippling effect on youth development and the inherently expensive nature of any solution to existing disparities. Experts called on legislators to make difficult choices on funding, and some suggested centralizing programs and diverting public funds from affluent areas to meet projected costs..  The caucus has already called two hearings on criminal justice, including one on police accountability and public safety, which took place the same day the caucus unveiled its agenda. The second, on sentencing reform, took place Tuesday..  Capitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government and distributed to more than 400 newspapers statewide.

JB Pritzker, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and community leaders gathered to kick off Hispanic Heritage Month in Little Village Wednesday.""We are giving away a full-blown Quinceañera, everything from the dress to the shoes, to the rosary, to the cake, to the DJ, to the videographer,"" said Cesar Rolon, a Chicago businessman who created the giveaway website . ""Everything a young lady wants for a Quinceañera, except for the social gathering.""To win, people must fill out the 2020 Census, get the Census registration number, and that number is entered on the Quinceañera website, Rolon said. So far, he said 400 people have entered, and more are expected to apply for the Sept. 30th giveaway.While there is only one winner, Rolon said everyone wins because each entrant will get more than $1,000 worth of coupons. He said it has pushed the younger generation to lean on their parents to complete the Census.""Killing two birds with one stone,"" said Joselyn Varrera, a young student who agrees with the multigenerational push. ""You're helping the children paying for the Quinceañera, which is a very special moment in any Latino culture. And you're helping provide more resources for the community as well.""Along with the Quinceañera giveaway, elected leaders are out in full-force, trying to convince Latinos, including undocumented immigrants to come forward. A Census 2020 event was held in Little Village Wednesday afternoon. The governor and several elected officials attended the event. Chicago's mayor used a sports metaphor to get her point across.The census count in Chicago is lagging behind the rest of Illinois, particularly in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the city.

But the city's rate is roughly 59% with some neighborhoods hovering around 30%, according to The Chicago Tribune.Those neighborhoods include the largely Black West Englewood neighborhood and Little Village, which has a large Hispanic population.""We have a saying that 'Your voice is your vote,'"" said Sylvia Puente of the Latino Policy Forum. ""Well, Census is going to bring resources and revenue and power to our community.Puente pointed to the amount of money lost or gained during the process. If one person does not complete the Census, that's $1,400 lost per person, according to a survey conducted by George Washington University.Over 10 years, that number jumps to $14,000, said Oswaldo Alvarez, the Illinois Census Director who is familiar with the study.","[0.5316198468208313, 0.4683801829814911]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5316198468208313

A CONVERSATION ABOUT: TERMINOLOGY, Thursday, September 17 at 2 PM on abc7chicago.com. The hour-long town hall will be moderated by ABC 7 Eyewitness News Anchor Mark Rivera..  Hispanic? Latino/a? Latinx? Spanish? Why the difference in these terms and what is the origin of each? Why do people identify as one over the other? And what does it mean in today's political and social environment?.  Chicago has a very diverse mix of Spanish-speaking communities: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Central American, Dominican, Cuban, South American. And then there are those who are born here and identify as Spanish, but choose not to use any of those labels..  In this week's digital town hall, Mark Rivera kicks off Hispanic Heritage Month speaking to representatives from two of Chicago's largest Latin-American communities, of different professions and generations to hear their perspectives on the various terminology, and what the different labels mean to them..  In addition, this town hall will examine how Chicago's Black and Brown communities have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, exploring some of the inequities that contribute to the disparities. And also to be explored are this community's support for racial justice and the strong push to make sure everyone completes the Census and registers to vote..  Panelists include:.  - Dr. Rosita López, Professor Emerita of Educational Administration and Leadership, Northern Illinois University.  - Jorge Valdivia, Arts & Media Consultant.  - Kenny Martin-Ocásio, Senior Vice President of Community Integration, Aunt Martha's Health & Wellness..  - Lucy Angel, Founder of Luce Ends and Co-Founder of Grocery RunClub.

1228,"It’s crunch time to get an accurate census count. Federal dollars for education, infrastructure and business development programs are at stake..  The Trump administration shortened the period that the count can occur, so all numbers have to be in by the end of this month, pending some court cases. How is Chicago doing, and how do local leaders plan to ramp up participation?.   According to census numbers, Chicago is currently performing at a 59% response rate, while Illinois at large is coming in at 70%, making it one of the top performing states in the nation..  But the city risks an undercount, especially in predominantly African American and Latino neighborhoods, which could put federal representation and hundreds of millions in federal dollars for the region at risk..  “Just a 1% undercount could result in the state losing $195 million a year, at a time when we frankly need the most funding we can get,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Wednesday at a census participation rally in Little Village..  Groups around the Southwest Side neighborhood set up tents making sure residents filled out their census forms. Nonprofit groups have had to get creative to encourage participation under the tightened deadline, as public officials hammer home what’s at stake in the final weeks..  “The streets, the roads, the things that make our communities vital, they are funded by money from the federal government,” said Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot. “We need our fair share, and the only way to get there is by making sure everyone is counted.”.  There are several factors complicating the count this year. The coronavirus pandemic has limited the ability for people to congregate and for volunteers to go door to door. Violent unrest in many neighborhoods has also been a concern, and the political rhetoric around undocumented immigrants pushing people into the shadows..  Different segments of the city are performing at vastly different rates. Affluent areas on the North and Northwest sides are responding at rates of 70%- 90%. But broad swaths of the South and West sides, in predominantly Latino and African American neighborhoods, the numbers are alarmingly low..  In a place like Little Village, where there is a high population of undocumented immigrants, volunteers have a lot of obstacles to try and get that count up..  “For us, with the political climate that we have and things that have been said in the media about Trump having a memo about immigrants not being counted or that ICE might get this information, it’s really about educating them and saying, ‘No, this is confidential.’ And reminding them this is a chance to have your voice heard. They don’t want it to be heard, so let it be heard,” said Katiria Diaz, a census volunteer with the nonprofit Enlace Chicago..  It’s why Enlace and other groups have held events featuring free tamale and ice cream giveaways, free laundry, and other incentives to encourage participation..  The same holds true for predominantly African American neighborhoods on the South and.  West sides like Austin, Garfield Park and North Lawndale. In North Lawndale, groups like the Sinai Community Institute have been canvassing the neighborhood. They too say they have to combat residents’ misgivings and reluctance to participate..  “If they have any kind of police record, sharing their information – is it going to be reported? How can’t it be used against them? How does it impact their families?” said Valerie Sanchez, a program manager for family case management at the Sinai Community Institute. “Once people are reassured that their safety and information is guarded, and we’re only here to help and provide services to them, they’re a little more willing to share their information.”.  Several groups suing the federal government has asked the census count continue through the end of October, but census groups say they are operating under the assumption that they will have to complete the count by the end of this month..

1229,"Twice defeated in the Illinois Supreme Court, advocates for stripping lawmakers of the power to draw legislative district boundaries are making a push to put a proposed amendment to the state constitution on the November ballot before the lines are set for another decade..  While the previous efforts aimed to get the issue on the ballot through petition-driven citizen initiatives, the latest attempt is backed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers who hope to gather enough support from colleagues to get the question on the fall ballot..  Advertisement A proposed state constitutional amendment filed Wednesday in the Illinois House and an identical version to be filed in the Senate would put the power to redraw legislative maps in the hands of an independent, citizen-led commission. Similar measures are introduced perennially in Springfield but routinely fail to gain the three-fifths majorities needed in each chamber to be placed on the ballot..  “Politicians picking their voters clearly is the epitome of a conflict of interest,” said Madeleine Doubek, the executive director of CHANGE Illinois, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for redistricting reform. “When politicians are protected by rigged maps, some of them come to believe they can act with impunity.”.  Redistricting occurs every 10 years after the U.S. census to account for changes in population, with the next map set to be drawn in 2021. This spring is the last chance for Illinois legislators to put the question to voters before new maps are drawn..  Under the Illinois Constitution, legislative district boundaries are determined by the General Assembly, often behind closed doors. The introduction of the proposed amendment comes two weeks after some legislators criticized Gov. J.B. Pritzker for not discussing the issue in his State of the State address..  Sign up for The Spin to get the top stories in politics delivered to your inbox weekday afternoons..  Pritzker, who supported taking lawmakers out of the redistricting process when campaigning for governor, has said he’ll veto any partisan map that reaches his desk.

1232,"The federal government is deploying new teams of immigration agents, many of which normally work near the border, to Chicago. AP The Trump administration is deploying special tactical units akin to SWAT teams to Chicago and other sanctuary cities to assist in everyday immigration arrests. News of the deployment, first reported by The New York Times on Friday, has triggered an immediate response from city officials and immigrant groups who decried the move as a intimidation tactic. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection confirmed the planned deployment to the Chicago Sun-Times. The agency will send 100 officers to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees arrests and deportations in the interior of the country. Among those being deployed are members of CBP’s elite tactical unit known as BORTAC . The unit is made up of specially trained agents that focus on high-priority targets like cartel members and human traffickers. BORTAC agents have also conducted missions in several countries and served alongside U.S. military personnel in Iraq. But in Chicago and other sanctuary cities, BORTAC agents “ will be asked to support interior officers in run-of-the-mill immigration arrests ,” according to the Times, which cited two officials familiar with the operation. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a video response released by her office Friday evening that the Trump administration is “yet again targeting our immigrant and refugee communities through its usual fear mongering and xenophobia.” “If anyone thinks that they can come here to our city and terrorize our residents into the shadows, let me say this: they’ve got another thing coming,” she said. Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th) said although it’s not the first time Trump has used federal agents to “target” Chicago, it’s chilling nonetheless. “It’s extremely important, even if he is crying wolf, that we take this seriously,” he said. Naureen Shah, senior policy and advocacy counsel on immigrant rights for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the deployment of tactical forces “is transparent retaliation against local governments for refusing to do the administration’s bidding.” She said it “will put lives at risk by further militarizing our streets.” Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. said “the reported deployment of excessively armed border agents to immigrant-welcoming communities only further illustrates how deranged and divorced from reality this administration’s immigration priorities are.” Per city law, the Chicago Police Department and all other city agencies are barred from cooperating with ICE except in cases where a targeted undocumented immigrant has an outstanding criminal warrant; has been charged or convicted of a felony; or has been identified by police as a gang member. Asked if the deployment could have a chilling effect on police-community relations, CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said it was important that external law enforcement agents properly identify themselves and don’t just wear uniforms that say “police” on them. “It is certainly a legitimate concern and creates a false perception for the Chicago Police Department,” he said. “Community trust and relationships are vitally important to us and we work very hard to safeguard those partnerships so we can be most effective in protecting neighborhoods.” Efforts to protect immigrants Ramirez-Rosa also fears news of the operation could drop economic activity in immigrant neighborhoods and “depress” local participation in the 2020 U.S. Census. He said the city is mobilizing to “protect immigrant families.” “We’re gonna be out knocking on doors, informing residents of their rights, but also making sure that, should immigration officials be present attempting to deport our families, that we’re gonna be prepared to take action to defend one another,” he said. “That can be yelling, ‘You have a right to remain silent. Don’t tell them anything.’ It can be recording the interaction so we have video to use in the future ... or, it can actually take the form of people using their bodies to engage in non-violent civil disobedience,” he said. In his record $4.8 trillion budget for fiscal year 2021, President Trump requested $3.1 billion in anticipation of a daily average census of 60,000 in ICE detention centers, an increase from the 54,000 requested last year.

1233,"A group of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle and several advocacy groups is turning up the pressure on the Illinois Legislature to pass an amendment to allow voters to change how legislative districts are drawn in Illinois..  The goal is to prevent gerrymandering of the state’s political boundaries. In Illinois, politicians control how legislative boundaries are drawn every ten years. This type of redistricting has been criticized as politicians picking their voters rather than voters picking their politicians..  In previous elections, some have blamed Illinois’ uncompetitive legislative maps for large numbers uncontested statehouse races. For the March Primary, 54 out of 118 Illinois state representatives seats are uncontested. Twelve of the 20 state senate seats up for reelection won’t face opposition from the other party..  A citizen-led effort to change how Illinois draws its political boundaries several years ago got more than half a million signatures, but was blocked in the courts after it was challenged by a law firm with connections to House Speaker Michael Madigan..  On Thursday, Madeleine Doubek from Change Illinois was joined by several other groups and a bipartisan contingent of lawmakers. She said May 3 is the deadline for lawmakers to pass an updated proposed amendment..  The updated proposal includes changes from previous plans, Doubek said, such as choosing map drawing commissioners from congressional districts..  “We’ve also loosened up the parameters for who can serve [on the commission] and upped the number of commissioners to 17 with eleven needed to approve maps,” Doubek said. “What that means is that no one group can control the map-making process.”.  With the 2020 Census set to begin soon, she said this is the year the measure must pass..  “The time for an end to gerrymandering is now so that we’re not saddled with another ten years of maps that stifle competition and suppress voters’ choices,” Doubek said..  Other groups that have signed on to support the new proposals filed in both the House and Senate include the League of Women Voters, Common Cause Illinois, along with groups such as the Illinois Farm Bureau, AARP, the Illinois Chamber of Commerce and more than a dozen others..  State Sen. Melinda Bush, D-Grayslake, said the way the maps are drawn now with the majority party controlling where the lines go breeds toxic politics..  “It only pushes incumbents to adopt an extremist political manifesto in an attempt to hold on to that seat,” Bush said. “Democrats become more liberal and Republicans more conservative and we lose any chance to a healthy balance between the two extremes.”.  Amid ongoing federal corruption probes involving state lawmakers, state Sen. Dan McConchie, R-Hawthorn Woods, said an independent commission is needed to combat self-interested politicians..  “So if you want to root out corruption in this state, this is the place we need to start,” he said..  McConchie’s office said Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 18 included the following provisions:.  Establishes an independent, 17-member commission appointed by the Illinois Supreme Court, that is charged with drawing the Congressional and General Assembly maps..  Seven commission members will be nominated from each political party (can’t be a sitting elected official or their employees) and three commission members will not be affiliated with either political party..  Allows the public to provide comment and submit maps during the map-drawing process for consideration by the Commission. The Commission is required to review all submissions..  House Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 41 is similar..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said he would veto any map he deemed unfair. Republicans have said that was too subjective. Bush said Thursday she plans to meet with the governor to discuss the amendment in hopes of bringing him on board..  A rally in support of the idea is being planned for March 26 at the capitol in Springfield. Tags","[0.538577139377594, 0.4614228308200836]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.538577139377594
1234,"History , Interviews , News , By Tasos Kokkinidis - Dec 24, 2019 Greek-American architect Steve Vasilion has designed a unique and spectacular monument to commemorate the United States’ annual June 14th celebration of Flag Day, in Batavia, Illinois. It is a thematic monument designed to recount the history of the United States in 25-year increments, beginning with its Declaration of Independence in 1776 and continuing through our times. Vasilion, a second-generation Greek-American, speaking to Greek Reporter said that the inspiration for the project was sparked by a conversation with a long-time client, who wished to create a monument for Bernard Cigrand. The dentist, who was from Batavia, Illinois, held what is believed to be the first recognized celebration of Flag Day in 1885, and began a lifelong quest to establish it as a formal holiday throughout the nation. “I wanted to create a dynamic monument that tells a story of the American nation — not a mausoleum that honors just one man that lived a century and half ago,” Vasilion explains. “It’s not a war memorial. It is designed to honor the American flag,” he adds. After several initial sketches, he came up the final version of his proposed Flag Day monument. The design features a 40-foot diameter helix-shaped structure with a base of dark granite and a 6-foot wide walkway around its perimeter. The flagpole, which towers at a height of 50 feet, will display a large 10-foot by 18-foot American flag. The helix, Vasilion explains, reflects the steady population growth of the United States throughout the years. Plaques showing the growth of the nation will be spaced at intervals around the helix. The lowest part of the helix reflects its population of 2.6 million in 1776 and its walls rise steadily until its highest point, where another plaque showing the US’ most recent census population of 310.2 million is placed. There are also several obelisks which commemorate iconic flag events, including Bernard J. Cigrand and the creation of Flag Day; Continental Congress’ establishment of the official US flag; and Betsy Ross, believed to be the seamstress who stitched the first American flag. Other obelisks show Francis Scott Key and his writing of the Star Spangled Banner outside Fort McHenry; the raising of the flag at Iwo Jima in WWII and the placing of the Stars and Stripes on the moon. The wide walkway around the perimeter of the monument will be called “The Ring of Honor.” Of the more than 3,500 service personnel who have received the Congressional Medal of Honor, 204 hailed from Illinois. Each one of them will be honored with a small plaque around the periphery of the ring. Vasilion has designed the Monument so that there will also be adequate room to honor future recipients of the Medal. The Greek-American architect says that he wanted the monument to have enough visual impact and meaning that schoolchildren, veterans’ associations and other groups could visit and learn from history. “In the end, a visitor will walk away with an appreciation for our flag, our nation, and the sacrifice that was made by so many for the freedom we enjoy today,” he says. The Flag Day project is at the fundraising stage at present. Vasilion says that the cost upon completion may approach $800,000, but over $500,000 has been raised thus far for the ambitious monument, which is slated to be completed by next Flag Day, June 14, 2020. He noted that fundraising plaques are available which can be purchased at very reasonable prices ($150, $300 and $500) to honor or memorialize any person or group and make them a permanent part of this important monument. The architect shared with us that he will buy a plaque to commemorate his father, Dimitri Vasiliou, who once served in the U.S. Army and was a Korean War veteran. Vasilion is justifiably proud of both his American and Greek heritage. His maternal relatives immigrated to the United States from the island of Crete, while his paternal family came from Athens and the island of Poros. https://usa.greekreporter.com/ ","[0.5040783286094666, 0.49592164158821106]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5040783286094666
1235,"Chicago’s fourth Women’s March will kick off Saturday with local leaders — including Mayor Lori Lightfoot, congresswomen Robin Kelly and Jan Schakowsky, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx and Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza — serving as “wayfinders” to honor and assist marchers with disabilities..  Organizers say it’s a way of ensuring all participants, not just the able-bodied folks, can focus on the issues on the table at this year’s march — specifically the 2020 census, climate justice, gun violence prevention, health care access and voting — rather than worrying about how to navigate the route and the crowds..  Advertisement I love the idea, and I’m happy to see the event shifting and evolving in both mission and execution since its inception..  I’ll never forget the feeling of watching the masses swell and grow in real time at the first march in January 2017. Tribune employees are prohibited from participating in political rallies, but I watched from the sidelines and met my mom and her marching friends for tomato soup afterward. My heart grew 250,000 sizes that day..  Organizers planned for 50,000 people; a quarter million showed. The following year, in 2018, 300,000 came ..  Last year, organizers staged a series of activist rallies in January in and around the city instead of a formal march, followed by an October March to the Polls . Saturday’s event marks a return to the traditional format..  It’s worth a look at what’s transpired since that first march, when activists around the world asked people to flood their streets the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration as a show of force in the face of threats to reproductive and civil rights and as a protest to his treatment of women, including the now-notorious “Access Hollywood” recording , in which he bragged about assaulting women..

1236,"Opportunity Zones show promise in Chicago. But some say the program has been underutilized, and it lacks accountability and oversight."" data-pub-date=""2020-01-10T13:28:15Z"" href=""#""> 4 min Provided courtesy of Chicago Housing Authority The Chicago Housing Authority is using Opportunity Zone money from PNC Bank for a commercial building at Ogden Commons in North Lawndale on the city's West Side. More content below this sponsor message.  A 400,000-square-foot building is under construction in Chicago’s Pullman neighborhood. The industrial space will open in April, but it doesn’t have a tenant yet because it was built on speculation..  “It’s a $35 million project. When we started it a couple of years ago, we were looking at different financing tools and different ways to structure this,” said David Doig, president of Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives, the development group spearheading this project and development in Pullman on the city’s Far South Side..  Doig said financial resources were exhausted for the industrial building. Allstate, the insurance company, funded the entire $35 million through what’s called an Opportunity Zone..  Opportunity Zones stem from President Donald Trump’s major tax cuts law from 2017. The federal program encourages rich investors to fund development in low-income communities through tax incentives. The program has potential, but there are downsides. For one, the impact of Opportunity Zones is hard to track because there is no oversight, at the local, state or federal level..  Opportunity Zones allow investors or for-profit companies to defer or reduce taxes on their capital gains. If an investor has $2 million in capital gains, for example, instead of paying taxes on it, the money can go into an Opportunity Zone investment. The first incentive means the tax can be paid several years from now. The second incentive is if the investor holds the investment for five or seven years, up to 15 percent of the taxes are wiped away. The money goes to an investment in an economically distressed area — like Pullman. Stay up-to-date with the latest news, stories and insider events.

The state of Illinois determined the 133 Chicago census tracts that qualify for Opportunity Zone money. And observers say the areas selected are places actually in need of investment — not the same controversy as wealthy areas qualifying for a tax subsidy, like the former Sears Tower, which is located within one of Chicago’s Tax Increment Financing, or TIF, districts. WBEZ found a handful of Opportunity Zone projects in Chicago. Again, there’s no official record keeping because there’s no requirement to do so..  Brett Theodos studies opportunity zones for the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. He said the general perception of Opportunity Zones is, “to date, underperforming the promise of how much capital would flow through this incentive. That’s true nationwide, not just Chicago.”.  Theodos has testified before Congress about changing the law to build in accountability. He also sees another weakness..  “It is pretty agnostic about what type of investment it’s incentivizing. So I’m encouraging localities, states, philanthropies, impact investors and others to co-invest in projects that are more clearly going to produce a community benefit,” Theodos said, which he also outlined in a report a year ago. This week, Theodos and other Urban Institute researchers released an assessment tool for investors, community groups, policymakers and others to use, if they want to measure the impact of an Opportunity Zone project..  The Chicago Housing Authority is an example of a co-investor. The public housing agency is using Opportunity Zone money from PNC Bank for a commercial building at Ogden Commons in North Lawndale. Tenants will include offices for Sinai Health System and Cinespace, as well as, restaurants..  “Quite likely this would not have been done without the incentive provided by the Opportunity Zone because of the large influx of capital needed in these depressed areas. The Opportunity Zones was a but for instrument — but for the Opportunity Zone, we would not see $12.5 million invested at Washtenaw and Ogden,” said Michael Gurgone, chief investment officer for CHA..  David Doig in Pullman said his sense is there’s more supply of Opportunity Zone funds than there are actual deals to be financed. Billions of dollars around the country that need a home for investment, he said..  “There’s just that — they’re a tool. Are they the end all, be all, are they going to solve all of our problems? No,” Doig said..  Natalie Moore is a reporter on WBEZ’s Race, Class and Communities desk.

Advertisement.  Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, college students were already considered a hard-to-count population in each decennial census. Although students in on-campus residences typically aren’t responsible for counting themselves, those in off-campus apartments and houses have the potential to be uncounted if they fail to fill out the census questionnaire..  Undercounts could diminish funding and political representation apportioned on the basis of population..

The U.S. Census Bureau announced Wednesday that it would suspend all field operations until April 1, with possible “additional adjustments” to be made later. In a telephone news conference Friday, census officials also announced they would delay the start of Early Nonresponse Followup operations, which are traditionally used to catch off-campus students in April before they leave town at the end of the academic semester, by over a month. Students who live in Northwestern’s on-campus dorms will be automatically reported by the university in the 2020 census, but thousands of off-campus students — who may have relocated across the country — will have to know to count themselves without seeing the mail reminders that arrive at their now-vacated homes..  “We are getting questions where students are now reaching out to us from, you know, home in New Jersey, and saying, ‘Hey, I was going to do my census, but I didn’t get the letter before I left.

Now that students have dispersed, they will have to shift their strategy online, but Dohanue said he’s cautiously optimistic it might be easier to attract students’ attention when they’re self-isolating..  This year will mark the first time U.S. residents can participate in the nine-question census online — as well as by phone or traditional mailed questionnaire. Since the census became available online on March 12, the Census Bureau has reported that more than 18.6 million households have responded..  Albert Fontenot, an associate director at the Census Bureau, said Friday that census officials intend to work with universities, the U.S. Department of Education and social media platforms to remind off-campus students to count themselves in their college towns. “We’re working very hard to get that message out to students so they can respond in a self-response mode.” Breaking News Newsletter As it happens Get updates on the coronavirus pandemic and other news as it happens with our breaking email alerts You are now following this newsletter.

1242,"In order to effectively address coronavirus in Illinois, we must address the critical needs of people experiencing homelessness and facing housing instability. Illinois legislators at the federal, state and local levels must take immediate action to provide for the hundreds of thousands of residents in these circumstances..  The coronavirus pandemic has made it clearer than ever housing is health care — and the health of each individual is linked to the health of everyone else in our communities. This public health emergency has upended life throughout our state for everyone, but people without homes or in unstable housing situations are at extreme risk of contracting the virus. How do you stay home when you’re homeless? How do you practice social distancing when you’re living in close quarters with others? What if you can’t work because of the pandemic — but can’t pay rent without your paycheck?.  Far too many Illinoisans are asking themselves these questions. The 2018 HUD Point-In-Time Count found that 10,643 Illinoisans experience homelessness on any given night; 2016 Census data shows nearly 165,000 are doubled up, living with family or friends. Another 450,590 renter households in Illinois are extremely low income, according to The Gap: A Shortage of Affordable Rental Homes, and 71% of these are severely cost-burdened, spending more than half their income on rent. This means they are living on the brink even when they’re not missing paychecks because of a pandemic. A high percentage of these Illinoisans are seniors, people with disabilities, and people with underlying health conditions, making them high-risk populations for the virus..  Federal legislation has overlooked the critical needs of these communities. But we have an immediate opportunity to provide for them: the coronavirus relief package under debate in Congress. Our Illinois representatives in D.C. must act quickly. Illinois lawmakers should call for the package to include significant funding to address homelessness and housing. This should include a $15.5 billion allocation for Emergency Solution Grant funds, which will expand access to emergency shelter; increased resources for Continuums of Care, which support homeless service providers; and additional funding for Public Housing Authorities, emergency rental assistance, legal aid for low-income households facing eviction, and housing counseling programs..  At the state level, Gov. JB Pritzker has taken important steps to address coronavirus. The Executive Order issued on Friday included a halt for evictions around the state, a valuable protection for households on the brink, and directed additional resources to assist those experiencing homelessness. Our homeless shelters are struggling, facing shortages of staff and supplies. Some have had to close programs; others are trying to implement social distancing measures by spacing out beds, which reduces capacity. We must support them even more and find creative solutions to help, such as one being undertaken in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has a contract with 900 hotels to shelter the homeless. Locally, our elected officials must also prioritize the needs of people experiencing homelessness and facing housing instability as they balance the many competing demands for their time and attention..  Our collective health in Illinois depends on everyone’s ability to stay at home. As long as people in our communities don’t have homes and safe spaces where they can self-isolate and practice social distancing, we are not truly containing coronavirus in Illinois..  Sharon Legenza is executive director of Housing Action Illinois, a statewide coalition that advocates to protect and expand affordable housing and end homelessness.

1247,"The City of Chicago is experiencing a decline in the Black Population. Lack of quality education, economic opportunities, increased crime, and the lack of affordable housing has contributed to the population decline in the city. The combination of the decline of the black population and the gentrification of many Chicago neighborhoods has left some longtime residents of the South and Westside communities feeling uneasy. This combination has driven up rents and driven out longtime working-class residents. Gentrification and affordable housing are some of the issues that helped Chicago Mayor, Lori Lightfoot, get elected..  One of Mayor Lightfoot’s key policy changes includes affordable housing. According to the government, affordable housing is 30 percent of one’s monthly income. The term Median income is the middle range of income of residents in an area that is set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. In Chicago, affordable housing is double what the average black family makes. The median income for a single person is $62,400, and for a family of four, that range is $89,100, which means that individuals could pay about $1560 to $2228 per month for rent..  To prevent Chicago from becoming another city where only the wealthy or upper-middle-class live, Mayor Lightfoot has put together a task force of housing advocates, activists, and developers. To make the Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO) work for everyone, the Inclusionary and Housing Task Force wants to pass affordable housing legislation soon and have it finalized by the end of the year. Mayor Lightfoot’s goal of reducing inequality, reversing population decline, and revamping the ordinance by mid-year in Chicago is her immediate plan..  The Affordable Requirement Ordinance (ARO) requires developers seeking zoning waivers for new residential projects to offer a percentage of the units at affordable rates to people making 60% of the area’s median income. The required number of affordable units range from 10% to 20%. However, the ARO has a loophole to allow developers to pay money into a fund rather than build affordable housing. Many developers choose to pay the fee. The fee goes into a city fund to be is used for affordable housing. Because of the fee option, the Chicago Housing Initiative stated that the ARO created 444 affordable housing units between 2007 – 2017. Developers of 88 projects paid fees to avoid building affordable housing. Many developers believe the ARO reduces its revenue with every development..  Mayor Lightfoot is considering a proposal to combat gentrification with a policy known as Inclusionary Zoning. This policy creates more affordable housing without spending tax dollars by having developers pay for it. Recently, aldermen and activists introduced legislation to overhaul the ARO. The Development for All Ordinance Measure would eliminate the ability for developers to-opt-out of building on-site affordable housing in place of fees..  Mayor Lightfoot believes that policies that reward developers for building initiatives such as the Renew Woodlawn Program show potential for renewal in areas left behind by traditional developers. The program plans to bring in more affordable housing and keep longtime residents in their homes, apartments and attract growth in communities on the South and West Sides..  The decline in the black population from the city and gentrification is happening simultaneously, with the lack of affordable housing is at its core. With the upcoming policy changes, longtime residents hope for a promising solution in order to see their neighborhoods thrive again, with new developments.","[0.6942003965377808, 0.30579960346221924]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6942003965377808

1258,"Send Email Cancel.  Illinoisans rose from their beds on New Year’s Day to the new and booming industry of legal recreational marijuana. Devotees lined the 20 some dispensaries celebrating in unison as old perspectives were toppled. To smoke marijuana in the minds of Illinois legislators is fine and dandy, made evident by the staggering $10 million grossed by facilities within the first week. While cannabis Illinois seems to be flourishing, not all are content. As people flooded dispensaries so did the online posts revealing the shocking tax on the hippy-herb. Currently, of the 10 states under legal recreational marijuana legislation, Illinois boasts the second-highest tax burden on retail sales according to a review of state and local regulation. In Chicago, consumers found themselves paying an upward tax of 41.25% on marijuana products after factoring in the Cook County excise tax. Additionally, the total doesn’t even include the 7% state wholesale tax further up the supply and production chain, which buyers will encounter in the form of higher prices. With so much emphasis on taxation, it begs the question: Where’s all that revenue going? Put down your tinfoil hats, there isn’t any shady government action going on. In fact, our public officials have been very transparent. Toi Hutchinson, senior adviser to the governor J.B Pritzker in a conference earlier this month worked to quench public inquiries. The senior adviser shared his high hopes for the booming industry and absurd review stating, “The amazing thing about that sales total is that there is a significant portion of these dollars that go directly into a community investment fund so that we can continue to rebuild communities that have been hit by the war on drugs.” This planned reconstruction is far from political palaver. Most recently the Evanson city council voted and vowed to allot the first $10 million of revenue from the new marijuana tax to finance a recently established reparation fund aimed at addressing the wealth gap and population decline among the city’s black residents. Currently, under law, 25% will go into programs appropriately dubbed R3s for their focus on the restoration, reinvestment, and renewal of communities affected by the criminalization of marijuana Though cannabis remains stigmatizing in the minds of many the future is promising. The once destructive force in communities has now been transformed into a means to restore and renew; a sentiment that is quiet poetic.

1259,"Lightfoot said she was prepared to walk out as Trump scorched “radical politicians” who provide sanctuary for “criminal illegal aliens” if he mentioned Chicago; instead he slammed New York and California. While Trump was met with a rousing welcome from Republicans, Speaker Nancy Pelosi tore up his speech when he was done. The speech, Lightfoot said, “makes me more resolved to do everything I can to change the results in November.” Lightfoot earlier in the day worked the precincts of the U.S. Capitol, where I caught up with her. I was a little puzzled why she wanted to sit in the House of Representatives gallery and listen to Trump since all she wants is to get him out of the White House. Last I saw her, on Jan. 24, the former federal prosecutor visited the Senate gallery to observe some of Trump’s impeachment trial. Trump delivered his address before a joint session of Congress a day before the Senate will vote to acquit him. Lightfoot, invited to the State of the Union by Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill. — the two are close — wanted to attend. Lightfoot sees part of her job, she told me, as being an “ambassador” for the city. After following around her for awhile, it seems to me she relishes that role. “Being here as a representative of the great city of Chicago gives me an opportunity to continue to be an ambassador for our city, to connect with federal representatives at every level,” Lightfoot told me. Lightfoot is a serious serial networker. I met her as she finished a Congressional Black Caucus event, where she met members of Congress, representatives of trade and social service organizations and the Urban League chief. Voting rights and the upcoming 2020 Census were among the items on the agenda. We headed to the vast Emancipation Hall in the Capitol’s visitor center, where a “media row” for television outlets was set up for interviews with members and their State of the Union guests. She did two hits for Chicago outlets, thankfully, from my perspective, not making any news for the competition. At the 2019 State of the Union, the female House Democrats decided to make a statement by all wearing “Suffragette white.” Now it’s a tradition, and this year, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot participated. Lynn Sweet/Sun-Times Media Row was a most excellent perch Tuesday. When Rep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., was spotted, Lightfoot went right up and introduced herself to the woman who was ex-President Bill Clinton’s Health and Human Services Secretary. “I’ve been a fan for a long time,” Lightfoot said. They had a brief chat about affordable housing. She met Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Ct., on the row and they chatted on how to address gun violence. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., walked by. He asked Lightfoot, “How’s your school system doing? Lightfoot and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., saw each other — they’ve met before — and the two publicly gay political figures — briefly caught up. At the 2019 State of the Union, the female House Democrats decided to make a statement by all wearing “Suffragette white.” Now it’s a tradition. Kelly was already in her white outfit. I asked Lightfoot — in a blue suit — if she brought along a white suit and she said yes. Lightfoot said, “I bought ... I have a white suit, but it wasn’t appropriate for this event.” I asked more about the mayor’s clothes, and it is not because Lightfoot is a woman. It is because she is a powerful figure in the public eye who Chicago is getting to know. Asking people where they buy their clothes tells you about them. I asked her where she buys her suits since that’s what she wears almost all the time. Lightfoot said, “Well, because of my stature,” referring to her height, “I don’t typically buy them off the rack. I have a tailor that I buy a lot of my clothing from.” She said she gets her suits from Richard Bennett, the custom tailor at 175 N. Franklin St. Lightfoot bought the white suit she wore to the State of the Union online from Macys.com. It’s not that easy to find white suits in the winter. FOOTNOTES: • Lightfoot said she is weighing endorsing House hopeful Marie Newman, seeking to unseat Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill. Lightfoot already signaled her support for Newman, but that’s not the same as an official endorsement. • Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., boycotted Trump’s speech. He said in a statement, “It would be painfully hypocritical of me to endure 90 minutes of unrelenting lies and all types of distortions and untruths, while at the same time watching his Republican apologists cheer. I cannot honor this man in any way.” Next Up In Commentary","[0.5000062584877014, 0.49999377131462097]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5000062584877014

1263,"Outmigration and Illinois' unfair tax system Quentin Fulks Guest columnist Posted 1/15/2020 1:00 AM The start of 2020 has brought us the beginning of a new decade and the start of an official election year. It's also brought a year in which the country will conduct its census, and there have already been efforts by those who have led the fight against the Fair Tax to mislead Illinoisans on the facts surrounding our state's troubling population loss. A report from the U.S. Census Bureau released in the final days of 2019 detailed just how drastic this problem has been. This data shows that Illinois lost 159,700 residents over the past decade, nearly 1.2% of the population. With a previous administration that left Illinois' education system decimated and social services underfunded, and with a fundamentally unfair tax system in place, it's no surprise so many Illinoisans chose to find another state to call home. For too long, Illinois has had a tax system that fails our working families and our state as a whole.

1264,"Outmigration and Illinois' unfair tax system Quentin Fulks Guest columnist Posted 1/15/2020 1:00 AM The start of 2020 has brought us the beginning of a new decade and the start of an official election year. It's also brought a year in which the country will conduct its census, and there have already been efforts by those who have led the fight against the Fair Tax to mislead Illinoisans on the facts surrounding our state's troubling population loss. A report from the U.S. Census Bureau released in the final days of 2019 detailed just how drastic this problem has been. This data shows that Illinois lost 159,700 residents over the past decade, nearly 1.2% of the population. With a previous administration that left Illinois' education system decimated and social services underfunded, and with a fundamentally unfair tax system in place, it's no surprise so many Illinoisans chose to find another state to call home. For too long, Illinois has had a tax system that fails our working families and our state as a whole. By forcing everyone to pay the same tax rate, regardless of income, lower and middle-class Illinoisans have been disproportionately burdened by their tax load.

1267,"Understanding the characteristics of neighborhoods is important for informing policy decisions about how to most equitably and efficiently allocate services, supports, and resources, but determining how to characterize neighborhoods is not a straightforward task..  This brief describes a data-driven method for characterizing neighborhoods in Chicago that leveraged publicly available census data and allowed researchers to consider many neighborhood characteristics simultaneously resulting in a set of five neighborhood groupings. Key Insights This “neighborhood-centered” (as opposed to a “variable-centered”) method resulted in a parsimonious set of five neighborhoods groupings in Chicago that focused researchers’ attention on the characteristics of neighborhood residents rather than the geographic locale of individual neighborhoods. The five groupings are relatively easy to describe and are easily understood by those familiar with Chicago. It is important to note that they reflect Chicago’s longstanding residential segregation patterns and racial and economic inequities. These neighborhood groupings allowed a more fine-grained look at sections of the city than is possible with the 77 community areas that are typically used, making variation within community areas more visible. This work provides just one example of how these methods can be useful to cities, school districts, and policy makers across the country. Future work can apply a similar approach for different objectives, including conducting research studies, making policy decisions, and providing services or resources.

1268,"Log in Sign up {{featured_button_text}}.  Following the release of U.S. Census Bureau numbers, Speaker Madigan and then-Senate President John Cullerton began the process of drawing new boundaries for 118 House districts, which would fold into 59 Senate districts. They also redrew the boundaries of federal congressional districts..  Madigan set up a secret Springfield office with highly restricted access. To draw a map friendly to Democrats, his mapmakers drew legislative districts that included incumbents’ homes and offices, their churches, their schools, their social circles — anywhere they could count on loyal support. Then they carved up Republican-leaning areas to dilute their potency..  They even sliced out potential political opponents. In one congressional race, they protected U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Western Springs, by drawing a potential primary election opponent into a different district so he couldn’t challenge the incumbent..  The mapmakers used a highly technical, computer-driven process to ensure their control over the legislature. Lawmakers were allowed into the map room on a one-by-one basis and were warned not to discuss it publicly. Gov. Pat Quinn signed that gerrymandered map into law..  It worked to Democrats’ advantage. In both the House and Senate they eventually gained supermajorities. How’s that working out, Illinois?.  Voters revolted and tried to get remap reform on the ballot by collecting more than 500,000 signatures. But Madigan’s top attorney filed a lawsuit and blocked the push for a constitutional amendment..  We hope Gov. Pritzker grasps the ultimate slap to Illinois citizens that disqualification process entailed. We hope the governor understands the corruption the current process breeds. No map can be truly fair when it’s so wholly driven by partisan politics..  Former state Rep. Peter Breen, R-Lombard, is part of a coalition reviving a citizen-driven petition process. It’s an uphill battle. But he says the group learned from the Illinois Supreme Court’s ruling last time and is fashioning a clean, straightforward amendment that would force bipartisan cooperation on map-drawing..  His group could use a reform-minded, ethics-driven governor to elevate the charge. It would be a chance for Pritzker not only to deliver for Illinois citizens, and keep his campaign promise, but also to build a lasting legacy on true ethics reform. His opportunity grows with each indictment of another lawmaker. ","[0.5749982595443726, 0.42500168085098267]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5749982595443726

1270,"SPRINGFIELD — The Illinois Department of Human Services said the state is poised to have one of the top census response rates in the country despite two tumultuous months of changing deadlines as determined by the Trump Administration..  Illinois sits at a 69.1 percent self-response rate as of Thursday, up two points from its 67 percent self-response rate on July 19. The national response rate was 64.2 percent..  The state’s 2010 census response rate was 70.5 percent, giving organizers hope of passing that mark by the Sept. 30 deadline – a date recently moved forward one month by the Trump administration..  Illinois currently has the seventh-highest self-response rate of any state in the U.S. and is the only state in the top 10 that has a population exceeding 10 million. Chicago also has the highest response rate for any city with a population over 2 million, according to the Illinois 2020 Census Office..  Maximizing the census count is important, because the population count helps determine federal funding and the number of representatives the state sends to the U.S. House..  The positive trend comes despite challenges posed by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and changing federal deadlines..  The Illinois 2020 Census Advisory Panel discussed obstacles to self-reporting and shifting standards from the federal government at a regularly scheduled meeting Friday..  ""This past month, as you all know, has been a month of many surprises for us at the census office,"" Oswaldo Alvarez, co-director of the Illinois Census Office at the IDHS, said..  There were several contributing factors that led the office to reorder its timeline, including delays in in-person door-knocking and the Trump Administration’s Aug. 13 announcement that the census portal would close Sept. 30 instead of Oct. 31..  ""So at this point we are operating at the census office as if (Sept. 30) is the official deadline and that’s it, until we are informed otherwise,"" Alvarez said. ""Because of that, there has been a lot of shifting that we have been doing at the census office."".  Additionally, a July 21 presidential memorandum seeking to exclude illegal immigrants from being counted as it pertains to Congressional apportionment also created confusion at IDHS. That memorandum has since been challenged in court, but, if implemented, would cost Illinois up to two seats in the House..  For the 2020 fiscal year, IDHS was funding more than 360 non-profits and municipal governments for the purpose of increasing census self-response rates. But that number has dwindled to a little more than 250 for fiscal year 2021 due to the pandemic, shifting deadlines and other circumstances..  Funds to those nonprofits are disbursed through 30 other non-profit organizations that serve as regional intermediaries, or RIs, which oversee 12 regions of the state and lead hyperlocal outreach efforts..  Intermediaries include health-based agencies such as the Illinois Primary Health Care Association, community outreach groups such as Teens Against Killing Everywhere, and other organizations such as the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus..  IDHS was allocated $29 million for the 2020 fiscal year to be used for census outreach, including nearly $26 million set aside for regional intermediaries..  State agencies assisting in census outreach were allocated $2.3 million, while approximately $900,000 went to the University of Illinois at Chicago for technical assistance and data analysis..  Due to the coronavirus pandemic, not all the funds were spent before the end of the fiscal year on June 30, so they were reappropriated for the current fiscal year. As of Friday, a little over $4.4 million remains unspent..  ""We were nervous that it would be a lot more remaining than 4.4 (million),"" Marishonta Wilkerson, also co-director of the Illinois Census Office, said at the meeting. ""We thought it would be like 10 (million). But the RI’s were creative, and they found different ways to engage their communities virtually and we are happy about that."".  Still, some areas of the state remain below their self-response target rates. As part of its August report, IDHS said many counties had self-response rates below 50 percent. As of July 29, Hardin, Calhoun, Henderson and Alexander Counties had the lowest response rates, with Hardin County in particular sitting at 31.9 percent, 10 percentage points fewer than the next lowest county..  ""The governor’s office has asked us to do a final and bigger push in certain areas of population, so we are having our RI’s gear up and do a big push,"" Wilkerson said. ""Additional canvassing, door-knocking in rural areas and in particularly the African American, Latinx and Asian areas."".

SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois Senate’s top Republican says regardless of whether House Speaker Mike Madigan (D-Chicago) is charged in the bribery investigation announced Friday, we know quite enough about what happened. “If the federal government imposed a $200 million fine,” Senate Minority Leader Bill Brady (R-Bloomington) said Monday, the representatives of the people of Illinois need to dig into this and see what happened and see that it doesn’t happen again.” The U.S. attorney’s office reports Commonwealth Edison paid the $200 million in a deferred prosecution agreement to answer allegations that it hired Madigan’s people in exchange for favorable legislation. Madigan is implicated but has not been charged, and he says he says the information he is turning over per a federal subpoena will exonerate him..  Dave Dahl can be reached at News@WJBC.com.

1276,"Cook County, Ill is seeing a spike in opioid overdose deaths this year, on pace to double last year’s figures , with the half-year-long public health crisis spiking..  Gun violence has also seen an uptick in Chicago..  Added to the mix are unsafe drugs on the market, creating the perfect storm..  According to EMS1 , street drugs are increasingly being cut with more dangerous substances, raising the risk of fatal overdose at a time when the pandemic has resulted in closures of some clinics and a reduction in available social services..  The toll is particularly heavy on the city’s West Side, where since late March, nearly 80 people have died in just a few ZIP codes..  Kathie Kane-Willis, a drug policy researcher at the Chicago Urban League , said emergency response data showed that overdoses started to rise sharply in November, long before the pandemic began..  The cause, she said, is an illicit opioid flow that has become ever more dangerous as heroin, derived from the opium poppy, is supplanted by far more powerful synthetic chemicals like fentanyl and its many cousins, which are cheaper to make and easier to smuggle..  Overdose victims have been as young as 18 and as old as 78, found unresponsive in a single-room-occupancy hotel, slumped in the passenger’s seat of an abandoned truck, sprawled on a sidewalk and collapsed in their own homes, among many other places..  Nearly 50% of the people who died were Black, though they only make up about 24% of the county’s population, according to 2019 census estimates. Whites made up about 36% of the deaths, Latino, about 13% and Asian, less than 1%..  Health care workers see increased access to naloxone as a main tool in the fight against opioid overdoses. The Chicago Recovery Alliance is piloting a program that will put naloxone vending machines in three spots in the city, with the first machine slated to be operational by August..  The Cook County’s Sheriff’s Office said officers’ use of naloxone has gone up nearly 300% since last year, resuscitating many people who otherwise might have died.

1279,"CHICAGO — Nearly half of working adults don’t have a retirement plan at work..  Illinois’ state-administered program, the Secure Choice Retirement Plan, has been designed to combat the retirement savings crisis that is threatening workers nationwide..  “Right now we have over 32,000 new savers, with about 4,600 employers throughout the state,” said Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs..  In the first year, Illinois workers have already invested $8.5 million with Secure Choice..  “The investments are portable, meaning they remain with the employees rather than the employer,” Frerichs said..  Illinois employers, with 25 workers or more, now offer Secure Choice as required by state law..  The default investment for employees is 5% of their paycheck, but Frerichs said that amount can be raised or lowered, or the employee can opt out of the program entirely..  Employers who do not offer their own retirement plan and do not participate in Secure Choice face a $250 fine for each employee in the first year and a $500 fine for each employee in subsequent years..  The Secure Choice program is managed on a day-to-day basis by Ascensus, a private-sector financial services firm. For more information click HERE ..

That’s a lot of people who could be missed in the Census..  The U.S. Census Bureau determines an area hard to count if the self-response rate in the 2010 decennial census was 73% or less. Illinois is using 18 variables associated with low census response, including housing, income, household language and internet access, to determine where the millions in grant funding will be distributed..  The largest grant distributions will go to organizations operating in Chicago and its suburbs, with a minimum allotment of $5 million and a maximum of $8.9 million. Here is what some other regions are getting:.  • Central region, including Sangamon County, is receiving $400,000 to $600,000..  • North Central, including Peoria, Tazewell and Woodford counties, is receiving $500,000 to $650,000..  • Northern, including Winnebago County, is receiving $750,000 to $920,000..  • West Central, including Knox County, is receiving $250,000 to $300,000..  Anita Banerji, director of the Democracy Initiative of the nonprofit organization Forefront, which participates in census outreach, told Capitol News Illinois the key to ensuring an accurate count is building trust in hard-to-count communities. She stressed any information a person puts on census forms is confidential..  “The advocates will have to be working smarter and harder to ensure that all residents across the state have accurate information, they feel safe and protected, and understand why it’s necessary to self-report,” Banerji said..  The Illinois Complete Count Commission is recommending people educate themselves and their communities about the importance of participation with census takers visiting their neighborhood; encourage trusted community partners such as churches and neighborhood organizations to motivate members to respond to the census questionnaire; and engage grassroots community organizations to reach out to hard-to-count groups who many not be motivated to respond to the census questionnaire..  Understandably, there is the concern about how census information will be used. The census questionnaire will not include a controversial question about a person’s immigration or citizenship status. The Census Bureau is bound by a code called Title 13, which outlines protections for the information collected. Personal information “is never published,” the agency states on its website, and “cannot be used against respondents by any government agency or court.”.  Given that, all Illinois residents must be mindful of what's at risk for us. With federal funding and representation in Congress in jeopardy, it is imperative Illinois’ count be accurate.

1284,"Now that sales of recreational marijuana have begun in Illinois, here is a look at what's ahead as far as cannabis business licensing, taxation and local decisions about recreational sales:.  Licensing • Thirty-six licensed medical marijuana dispensaries across the state also are selling recreational marijuana to adults 21 and older, including in Mundelein, North Aurora and Addison. A total of 48 dispensaries have been licensed to sell recreational pot, but not all are doing so, in part because local zoning codes don't allow it in places such as Naperville and Arlington Heights..  • The Department of Financial and Professional Regulation will award up to 75 licenses by May 1 for new recreational marijuana dispensaries across the state, 47 of them in the greater Chicago area. (Up to 110 more licenses will be awarded by Dec. 21, 2021.).  • The Department of Agriculture will award up to 40 licenses by July 1 for marijuana craft growers, up to 40 licenses for marijuana infusers and an unlimited number of licenses for marijuana transporting organizations. (Up to 60 more licenses each for craft growers and infusers, and more for transporting organizations, will be awarded by Dec. 21, 2021.).  • A DUI cannabis task force -- led by the state police director or his or her designee -- will present its report and recommendations on improvements to enforcement of driving under the influence of cannabis to the governor and the General Assembly by July 1..  by signing up you agree to our terms of service • Up to eight community colleges will be awarded a license for a cannabis vocational pilot program by Sept. 1. The colleges can start programs in the 2021-22 academic year for students who are at least 18. The students will receive a ""career in cannabis"" certificate..  Taxation • Dispensaries on Jan. 1 began charging the following taxes: The regular 6.25% state sales tax and regular local sales taxes, plus new cannabis taxes based on potency with cannabis with THC at or below 35% taxed at 10%, cannabis with THC level above 35% taxed at 25%, and all cannabis-infused products taxed at 20%..  • Dispensaries must make their initial payments of taxes collected in January to the Department of Revenue by Feb. 20. The previous month's cannabis tax returns, along with any payment owed, then will be due monthly on the 20th day..  • Under the law, 35% of marijuana tax revenues will go to the state's general fund; 25% will go to the ""restore, reinvest and renew,"" or R3, program, an effort to reinvest in communities most affected by the criminalization of marijuana; 20% will go to address substance abuse and mental health; 10% will go to pay the state's bills; 8% will be distributed among local governments to support law enforcement; and 2% will go to fund a public education campaign and data analysis about the effects of legalization..   • The Department of Revenue anticipates the first transfer of the 8% to local governments will occur in March. After that, transfers will occur monthly..  • The first transfer of the 25% to the R3 program also is expected to occur in March. Areas are eligible to apply for grants through the program based on census data about gun injury, child poverty, unemployment and state prison commitments and returns. In the suburbs, these areas include parts of Aurora, Elgin, Carpentersville, Streamwood, Hanover Park, Wheaton, Waukegan, Zion, North Chicago and Joliet. Officials do not yet know when the first grants will be distributed..  • Distribution of regular local sales taxes from cannabis purchases will begin in April and will occur monthly..  • Local cannabis sales taxes imposed by municipalities and counties will be charged beginning July 1, if the municipality or county adopts an ordinance and files it with the Department of Revenue by April 1. If a municipality or county establishes a tax by ordinance between April 2 and Oct. 1, the tax will be charged beginning Jan. 1, 2021..  • Distribution of new cannabis sales taxes collected starting July 1 will begin in October and will occur monthly..  Decisions • Naperville voters can weigh in on March 17 about whether to allow recreational marijuana sales within city boundaries. The referendum question is nonbinding, but several city council members have indicated they will follow the will of voters. The city so far has banned recreational sales..  • Moratoriums on recreational sales are set to expire May 31 in Hawthorn Woods, June 30 in Rosemont and Oct. 26 in Glen Ellyn..  • Voters in Batavia can decide in a binding referendum Nov. 3 if they want to allow recreational sales within city limits..  0 Comments Related Coverage Related Article.

1287,"The good news: Terry Link quit his job..  The bad news: Not fast enough..  Let’s review: On Aug. 13, federal prosecutors charged then-state Sen. Link, D-Indian Creek, with filing a false income tax return in 2016. Link had been in the senate since 1997, shortly before his 50th birthday. Five years earlier he won election as chairman of the Democratic Party of Lake County. He finished third in a 2013 mayoral primary in Waukegan, but continued to crusade for bringing a casino to the region and was chairman of the Senate Gaming Committee..  On the day the indictment dropped, Link resigned from the Legislative Ethics Commission. Soon thereafter he said he’d relinquish his county chairmanship on Sept. 15, but soon advanced that timetable once party leaders made it known they convene Aug. 31 to formally remove him..  The stated concern was clear: If Link quit the Senate after Sept. 11 but before Sept. 15, he could effectively name his replacement. Under current state law, a legislative resignation on Sept. 12 or later wouldn’t be put to voters — despite a looming election —because there are fewer than 28 months in Link’s term. That means party leaders in the district appoint a replacement, and Link held sufficient power given the 30th district is almost entirely north of Lake Cook Road..  (The 30th yin-yangs nicely with the 26th District of Sen. Dan McConchie, R-Hawthorn Woods. He and Link are practically neighbors relative to the far-flung nature of their constituents. But that’s all likely to change with the results of this year’s Census. Anyway…).  So Link left the county party earlier than originally promised. Good. But he retained his Senate seat. Bad. On Sept. 11 he formally announced he’d resign the next day. That wasn’t just a Saturday, it was the first day Link could quit without triggering a special election..  Former state Rep. Lauren Beth Gash now runs the county party. She’ll convene with state Rep. Mark Walker, also a Wheeling Township Democratic committeeman, and they’ll name Link’s replacement by Oct. 12. Gash’s GOP counterpart, Mark Shaw, released a blistering statement accusing Link and Gash of scheming, “While the rest of the nation was honoring the victims and heroes of 9/11 … to abuse Illinois State election law loopholes.”.  Strictly concerning timing, Shaw is right: this stinks for anyone who supports voter choice. Link is far from the first lawmaker to employ this strategy. All House vacancies are filled by partisan appointment, because the 1970 state Constitution framers apparently abhorred special elections..  While voters await an ethics commission’s legislative recommendations, here’s hoping addressing such loopholes is on the list. Link’s public days are over, but legislators will continue to follow this sketchy playbook..  • Scott T. Holland writes about state government issues for Shaw Media Illinois.

Latinx? Spanish? Why the difference in these terms and what is the origin of each? Why do people identify as one over the other? And what does it mean in today’s political and social environment?.  Chicago has a very diverse mix of Spanish-speaking communities: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Central American, Dominican, Cuban, South American. And then there are those who are born here and identify as Spanish, but choose not to use any of those labels..  In this week’s digital town hall, Mark Rivera kicks off Hispanic Heritage Month speaking to representatives from two of Chicago’s largest Latin-American communities, of different professions and generations to hear their perspectives on the various terminology, and what the different labels mean to them..  In addition, this town hall will examine how Chicago’s Black and Brown communities have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, exploring some of the inequities that contribute to the disparities. And also to be explored are this community’s support for racial justice and the strong push to make sure everyone completes the Census and registers to vote..  Watch: Part 2 of the panel.

Democracy is “under siege from multiple directions” in America during a summer of violence, civil unrest and pandemic-fueled hardship that has left people disengaged from their government and intolerant of each other, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Wednesday..  Lightfoot unexpectedly turned the latest in a series of news conferences aimed at encouraging Chicagoans to participate in the 2020 U.S. Census into a rousing political address that, aides said, was triggered by the extraordinary moment facing Chicago and the nation..  The death of George Floyd and the civil unrest and racial reckoning it triggered. The coronavirus pandemic that has fallen hardest on Black and Hispanic communities and exacerbated racial inequities that existed long before COVID-19. The death of civil rights icon John Lewis. The spike in murders and shootings in Chicago and other major cities. The hyper-partisan political atmosphere created by, but not limited to President Donald Trump and his re-election bid..

1297,"August 05, 2020 05:20 PM Illinois has $300 million to help renters, homeowners catch up on payments The money—$5,000 for renters and up to $15,000 for homeowners—is a way to forestall massive waves of eviction and foreclosure caused by the pandemic. Reprints Print Getty Images.  A demonstrator calls on the governor to suspend rent and mortgage payments during a protest April 30 in Chicago..  The state of Illinois is unveiling a $300 million fund to help people who have fallen behind on the rent or the mortgage because of COVID-19..  The money, part of the $3.5 billion that Illinois received from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, “will help make people whole who were suddenly hit with income loss or unemployment by the COVID-19 crisis,” said Kristin Faust, executive director of the Illinois Housing Development Authority, which is administering the program. Related Article COVID crisis makes 28 percent of Cook households vulnerable to housing loss.  The grants should “help stabilize people in their homes, which is where we need to be during this pandemic,” Faust said, and by preventing evictions and foreclosures, “stabilize landlords and communities."".  In July, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that about 28 percent of adults in Illinois were not confident they could make their next housing payment..  An Aspen Institute study found that in Illinois, 20 percent of rental households , or over 775,000 people, would be at risk of eviction in the third quarter of 2020 if it were not for the statewide moratorium on evictions. In July, Gov. J.B. Pritzker extended the moratorium through Aug. 22. When the moratoriums expire, housing policy experts say, not only Illinois but much of the nation could face a tidal wave of evictions..  Foreclosure of homeowners is a longer process, particularly in Illinois and other states where it’s a judicial action..  In either case, an IHDA grant “can prevent this from happening to you while we’re in the midst of a pandemic,”Faust said. “There is no shame in taking this kind of help. Everyone was caught unawares.”.  For renters who qualify, $5,000 will be paid directly to their landlord. Applications for the Emergency Rental Assistance program open Aug. 10 at this website and close Aug. 21. An application requires the landlord to upload some information in support of the renter’s claim..  Homeowners who qualify can get up to $15,000 sent directly to their mortgage servicer. Applications for the Emergency Mortgage Assistance program open Aug. 24 at this website and close Sept. 4. Applicants must owe $425,000 or less on their mortgage, and the property must be their primary residence..  Both programs have household income limitations, spelled out on their separate websites. They also require applicants to provide evidence that they were up to date on their housing payments prior to the crisis, and only fell behind since then..  Pritzker is expected to promote the program at a press conference early next week, Faust said, and in recent days her agency has been getting the word out to housing agencies, landlord groups and others..  The IHDA assistance “will buy us time so we don’t go over a cliff” of evictions, said Rob Anthony, president of the not-for-profit Community Partners for Affordable Housing, based in Libertyville. Anthony’s group, which serves Lake County and northern Cook County, is among those that IHDA has trained on the program and will help applicants..  In the months since the pandemic crisis began in March, Anthony said, his organization has been receiving “five times as many calls for help than we did before March,” he said..  Faust said her research indicates that the state’s $300 million is the largest amount any state has used from its CARES Act funding to support housing payments. The reason, she said, is that “we have a governor who cares deeply about keeping everybody housed during this crisis.” She expects to disburse funds, $150 million each for the renter program and the homeowner program, until the pot is depleted.

1298,"Chicago has higher millennial homeownership rate than national average by Andrew Stahl August 03, 2020.  A report from Porch , an online service for home improvement projects, found that Chicago has a higher millennial homeownership rate than the national average. Just over 42% of Chicago millennials own homes, 2.7% points more than the national average millennial homeownership rate of 39.5%, Porch reported..  The millennial homeownership rates are lower than those of previous generations at the same age, the report found, for a variety of reasons, such as higher student loan debt, delayed age of marriage, lack of affordable housing, and different geographic preferences than older generations. The current national homeownership rate is 63.9%, while for millennials it is only 39.5%..  Porch analyzed data from the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Zillow in order to rank U.S. metro areas according to millennial homeownership rates. In order to determine some of the underlying factors of the overall rate, they also examined local median home prices, average monthly mortgage payments, median earnings for full-time workers and the cost of living..  The report found several possible reasons for Chicago’s slightly higher homeownership rates. The cost of living was 2% below the national average, and the median home price in Illinois was $204,872, compared to the national median of $251,598. Porch also found that, while the cost of a home was lower in Chicago, average earnings are higher: A typical monthly mortgage payment was $727 in Chicago, compared to $893 nationally, while the median earnings were $45,000 in Chicago compared to the national average of $40,000.","[0.5040855407714844, 0.49591442942619324]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5040855407714844

Trump. Arrest Stupid. From Illinois. She is killing us https://t.co/uwdzCgOdCN.  Trending: Pelosi Says She Will Refuse More Money For Paycheck Protection Program Without Far-Left ‘Considerations’.  Press release : Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot today signed an executive order explicitly ensuring that all benefits, opportunities, and services provided or administered by the City of Chicago are accessible to all residents, regardless of birth country or current citizenship status..  “This order is more than just an official decree, it is a statement of our values as a city and as Americans,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “Since COVID-19 first reached our city’s doorstep, we have been working around the clock to ensure all our residents are secure and supported, including our immigrant and refugee communities, who are among the most vulnerable to the impact of this pandemic. Here in Chicago, saying ‘we are all in this together’ means that during this crisis, no one gets left out and no one gets left behind.”.  The City of Chicago faces a severe and unprecedented threat to its residents in COVID-19. While this disease is presenting challenges of historic proportions to the lives of residents, this order will ensure that all Chicagoans have fair and equal access to benefits, opportunities, and services provided by the City, including anything provided as disaster relief to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic..  “Not all of Chicago’s residents qualify for federal stimulus checks, state unemployment insurance or other economic assistance due to their documentation status,” said 22 nd Ward Alderman Michael D. Rodriguez. “These Chicagoans are vital community members who work in various industries and help our great city to thrive every day. These Chicagoans are our family members, co-workers, neighbors and friends. I applaud the Mayor for standing with undocumented individuals and families to ensure their eligibility for any economic assistance offered by the City of Chicago during this global pandemic.”.  To address the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to Chicago’s communities, including its immigrant community, the City of Chicago has implemented numerous programs to aid all residents during this extraordinarily challenging time, including: Establishing the COVID-19 Housing Assistance Grant program, which provides disaster relief aid for the housing costs faced by individuals and families impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic; Offering online Enrichment Learning Resources through Chicago Public Schools for all students at all levels, so that each student, regardless of immigration status, can continue to pursue a top-notch education; and Starting a $100 million Chicago Small Business Resiliency Fund to provide small businesses with disaster relief cash flow during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is available to any entrepreneur, including immigrant business owners..  “Most individuals in our immigrant community labor in industries pummeled by the COVID-19 crisis, such as restaurants and hotels. Although many of these workers collectively pay billions of dollars in taxes, they are excluded from the federal aid package signed by Congress. We must meet this moment together; no one should be excluded. I thank Mayor Lightfoot for ensuring that everyone in Chicago has somewhere to turn to for support,” said 12 th Ward Alderman George Cardenas..  Since taking office, Mayor Lightfoot has made intentional efforts to protect the immigrant community and is committed to continuing that support. She has: Visited multiple immigrant and refugee communities throughout Chicago during the summer and fall months when the federal government was threatening raids to personally share “Know Your Rights” information with businesses and community members; Invested an additional $250,000 into Chicago’s Legal Protection Fund, increasing its funding by nearly 20%; Passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency (ACT) Ordinance, which officially terminates ICE’s access to Chicago Police Department databases related to civil immigration enforcement activities and reaffirms the City’s commitment not to cooperate with or facilitate any ICE effort to target Chicago’s immigrant families; Committed $2.7 million to the 2020 census, with a focus on hard-to-count communities, which includes immigrants; and Hosted the administration’s first citizenship ceremony at City Hall. 2.4K shares","[0.5014505386352539, 0.49854952096939087]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5014505386352539
1300,"A noted journalist and comedian of Palestinian descent questioned the process of taking a census count in Illinois and alleged that the governor is playing politics and ignoring Arab-Americans..  “Are census funds and the census about counting people? Or, is it really all about politics and money? Lots of money?” Ray Hanania asked in a op-ed piece for Suburban Chicagoland..  Hanania said Pritzker, a Democrat, allocated $20 million for the census count taken every 10 years to determine the country’s population. But he said the biggest slice of the $20 million, more than half, is going to seven organizations in Chicago, the Cook County Suburbs and certain counties that do not reflect Arab-American populations..  The list he provided included Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR) with $3.75 million, Habilitative Systems Inc with $2.35 million, Community Assistance Programs listed at $1 million, Illinois Action for Children with $1 million, Rincon Family Services at $1 million, YWCA Metropolitan Chicago with $1 million and the Metropolitan Mayor’s Caucus for $1 million..  “The largest recipient, the ICIRR, doesn’t have one Arab or Muslim board member,” Hanania said and reported by Suburban Chicagoland. “They have assigned funds to only two of the state’s 60 qualified Arab/Muslim groups, the Arab American Family Services and the Arab American Action Network..  ""Both by the way were instrumental in protesting against Sharon Brannigan in Palos Township,"" he added. ""They are only two Arab organizations among the more than 50 Arab/Muslim organizations that could be funded in Northern Illinois and that are less politically focused.”.  Brannigan, a trustee of the Palos Township Board, generated controversy when she allegedly made racist comments about Muslims and Arab-American residents on social media two years ago. Brannigan has refused calls to resign and remains on the board..  Hanania said Arabs-Americans are not being counted..  “The sad truth is, not in Illinois and not at the rate they should be in the rest of the country,” Hanna told Suburban Chicagoland. “Most Arab and Muslim groups are being excluded. Arabs and Muslims are the most undercounted immigrant constituency in America and especially in suburban Cook County and Chicago. The biggest undercounted constituency is in the 3rd Congressional District (Cook County), which has one of the largest Palestinian, Christian and Muslim constituencies of any congressional district.” Weekly Newsletter Sign-up and get latest news about the courts, judges and latest complaints - right to your inbox.

Here in Chicago, saying ‘we are all in this together’ means that during this crisis, no one gets left out and no one gets left behind.”.  The City of Chicago faces a severe and unprecedented threat to its residents in COVID-19. While this disease is presenting challenges of historic proportions to the lives of residents, this order will ensure that all Chicagoans have fair and equal access to benefits, opportunities, and services provided by the City, including anything provided as disaster relief to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic..  “Not all of Chicago’s residents qualify for federal stimulus checks, state unemployment insurance or other economic assistance due to their documentation status,” said 22 nd Ward Alderman Michael D.

Although many of these workers collectively pay billions of dollars in taxes, they are excluded from the federal aid package signed by Congress. We must meet this moment together; no one should be excluded.

1307,"Tweet.  Philly has a lot of pizzerias. It’s not something the city is known for — tomato pie is a whole different beast — but anyone who lives here can speak to the idea..  “I literally have a pizza shop on my block, and there’s many others.” said Carolyn Wyman , a nationally-recognized food historian with seven culinary books to her name. “I live in South Philly and every corner pretty much has a deli or a food store.”.  Combine those neighborhood joints with the city’s longtime mainstays — 92-year-old Marra’s on East Passyunk, or 73-year-old Taconelli’s in Port Richmond — plus the wave of fancy Neapolitan makers (Stella, Pizzeria Vetri, Nomad), the trendy Roman-style pizzaiolos (Alicé, Rione) and the onslaught of build-your-own chains (&Pizza, Snap, Blaze) and you have a pie scene that’s truly bursting at the seams..  There’s so much pizza here that a recent study by Apartment Guide found Philly has the second-highest number of pizzerias per capita among large U.S. cities — nearly 27 for every 100,000 people..  That’s more even than pizza-famed NYC, which has an average of around 17 per 100k if you add the boroughs together. Chicago comes in with a measly 15. By the survey’s count, Las Vegas is at the top of the list with just over 40 pizzerias per 100k — probably attributable to its much lower number of permanent residents and a restaurant scene built for tourism..  The report does give Philly unconditional first in a different slot: 15.5% of all eating establishments here are pizzerias, it says..  How many pizza spots does Philadelphia have? That’s an open question..  Apartment Guide’s numbers are calculated using a base of nearly 3,000 restaurants and more than 400 pizzerias. But a study from the Health Department earlier this fall found Philadelphia has more than 6,000 places to eat . And a Yelp search for “pizzerias” inside the city brought up more than 2,300 responses. Arabiatta pie from the original Pizzeria Beddia Danya Henninger / Billy Penn Italian roots, and cheesesteaks too.  Part of the city’s pizza proclivity could be traceable to its residents’ ancestry. According to census data, Philadelphia is home to the second largest Italian-American population in the country..  Naples is the original home of some of the owners behind LaScala’s Birra, which operates two locations, one in South Philly and another in South Jersey. Both spots make Italian-style pies, with flour shipped from the Old Country and proofed for 48 hours..  “I feel also because there’s a big Italian community and people in Philly, they really love pasta,” said Davide Lubrano Lavadera, manager at LaScala’s Birra on East Passyunk..  He made a quick addendum: “And pizza and fries and cheesesteak.”.  That’s consistent with speculation from author Wyman, who runs a regular Taste of Philly food tour . “Frankly, I think a lot of those pizza places are selling cheesesteaks,” she told Billy Penn..  West Philly pizza shop owner Tim Mironives is certainly selling sandwiches. He said pizza makes up between 40 to 50 percent of his sales at Atlas Pizza..  Located on South 52nd Street, the neighborhood shop has been in business for about 20 years. Mironives said he entered the pizza game because he saw it as a great business opportunity. “I would say we’re more flexible to the change of times,” he said. “Our customers are more loyal.”.  It’s a loyal customer base that’s kept Joe’s Pizza in Center City afloat for more than three decades, said co-owner Casimira Villico. Villico runs Joe’s and several other Philly slice shops with her husband Ernesto, who moved to the states from Sicily, Italy..  “We have customers that have been coming for 30 years,” Villico said. “They don’t come for cheesesteaks, they come for pizza.” Roman style pizza at Rione Danya Henninger / Billy Penn Upside-down and everything in between.  If there’s one thing everyone can agree on about Philly pizza, it’s that it’s not going anywhere..  The city also brings its own unique style: the upside-down pie, popularized by local cult-favorite Santucci’s, which has several outposts around the city run by various members of the founding family..  It’s also found at Stogie Joe’s Tavern on East Passyunk. One of the newer kids on the block, the shop just celebrated its 10-year anniversary. It’s known for the upside-down style, which features a crispy square crust and flips the ingredients, putting the cheese beneath the sauce..  Stogie’s manager Joey DiOrio said the unique and diverse offerings of pizzerias in Philly are what keep them all in business on that side of town..  “Thinking about the pizza places that are on Passyunk Ave., they all do a little bit of everything,” DiOrio told Billy Penn. Still, he said pizza accounts for half of all the restaurant’s sales..  Plenty of artisan spots tossing Neapolitan pies and build-your-own chains joined the family-owned neighborhood shops across the urban grid over the past couple decades. Though they represent a hefty slice of the city’s pizza scene, Philly’s traditional pie purveyors are still comfortably going strong..  “A lot of people are constantly feeling worried about the competition, but in our case we tend to be friends with everyone because in this business,” said Lubrano Lavadera of LaScala’s Birra. “I feel like what you want is to never stop learning.” Want some more?

Schools are closed statewide through at least April 7, with the possibility of more extensions. Of particular concern is Chicago Public Schools, where a majority of students are considered economically disadvantaged, lacking proper devices or inadequate internet access at home, the Chicago Tribune reported..  Of households within the boundaries of CPS, about 14% didn’t have a home computer and 24% lack a broadband internet subscription, according to 2018 U.S. Census Bureau data..  Rather than wait for officials to act, parents and teachers have taken matters into their own hands, including a public video plea on Twitter from the principal at Passage Charter School in Andersonville asking for donations of laptops or tablets..  “We serve mostly immigrant and refugee students, and we have a real need for devices for online learning,” Principal Jeremy Riggs said in the video. “There is a huge equity issue for me. In order for all of our kids to have access, we need some help."".  CPS officials say they're doing “whatever we can to help bridge the digital divide” for the district's 355,000 students. The Board of Education unanimously approved a $75 million coronavirus spending proposal that will be used for a new “device equity strategy.”.  Some internet providers such as Comcast and AT&T have all taken measures to help, including adding free broadband internet for two months for new low-income customers..  “We’re seeing really strong interest in the offer,” Comcast spokesman Jack Segal said in an email. “We’ve been doing outreach to schools and school districts, veteran-serving organizations and partners that work with seniors to make sure low-income households in our footprint know and are doing our best to help as many people as we can get online.”.  Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson said while the district is spending more money on resources, they are also working with elected officials to leverage support..

The Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability, the General Assembly’s bipartisan fiscal forecasting arm, found that the state ended the 2020 fiscal year with a $1.135 billion decline in base revenues compared to the previous fiscal year..  Although tax revenues declined across the board, the steep drop of $947 million in personal income tax had the highest impact overall. Corporate income taxes saw a $430 million decrease, nearly a 14% decline. Sales tax collections fell by $206 million..  Illinois’ fiscal year spans from July 1 to June 30..

CHICAGO , IL– Reaching to news that the Census Bureau has identified Asian Americans from countries like India and China as the fastest growing demographic group in Illinois, State Senator Ram Villivalam (D-Chicago) vowed to continue to vigorously support Asian Americans, both recent immigrants and those who have been here for generations..  “We need to ensure Asian Americans have access to all of the same state services as other Illinois residents,” said Villivalam, the first Asian American elected to the Illinois Senate and the Co-Chair of the Illinois General Assembly’s Asian American Caucus. “Making sure documents and websites are available in Asian languages is an important first step, and one that I’ve been pushing especially hard during the COVID-19 pandemic.”.  According to the Census Bureau, Illinois’ Asian American population has increased by 24% since 2010, with Asian Americans now making up 5.7% of the people in the state..  “People who come from Asian cultures are helping increase the diversity and vibrancy of American culture,” Villivalam said. “The days of Asian Americans only living on Devon Ave., in Chinatown and in other nationality-based enclaves are over. Now, you see temples, shrines, mosques, and restaurants serving food from across the Asian continent in cities big and small.”.  Villivalam vowed to use his position as the first Asian American elected to the Illinois Senate to help educate his colleagues about the Asian American community and to help bring the community’s long-unrepresented perspective to all levels of Illinois government. Since joining the Senate, he has helped steer additional funding to support the Asian American community’s infrastructure needs by facilitating the creation of a Pan Asian American Community Center and an Asian American Chamber of Commerce, passed a law creating the Asian American Family Commission, and sponsored other measures targeted at the unique needs of Asian Americans and Asian immigrants..  Villivalam also views the announcement that Asian Americans are the fastest growing group in Illinois as a reminder of how important it is to fill out the census..  “If the Asian American community wants the representation it deserves in government and its fair share of federal resources, we all need to fill out the census,” Villivalam said.","[0.7667302489280701, 0.23326972126960754]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.7667302489280701
1320,"CHICAGO — Chicago is lagging behind the rest of the country when it comes to filling out the 2020 Census, officials said Monday..  The current response rate for the 2020 Census is about 62 percent in the U.S. and 66 percent in Illinois, but in Chicago only 55 percent of residents have filled out the census so far. City leaders say numbers are even lower in neighborhoods that are lacking resources on Chicago’s south and west sides..  More than $675 billion is distributed every year based on census numbers, to help pay for better schools, roads, parks and libraries..  Speaking Monday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot appealed to Chicago residents to complete the census, since responses will guide federal funding for the next 10 years..  “The census isn’t just about tallying our city’s population, it’s about making sure we have the resources we need to make sure that investments happen all over this city,” Lightfoot said. Here’s what you need to know about the 2020 Census.  According to one estimate, $1,400 is lost every year for every individual that doesn’t participate in the census..  “We hear so often ‘my community needs’ well the census count can help an accurate count can help fulfill those needs of our communities,” said Marilyn Sanders, Midwest Regional Director of the Census Bureau..  Local leaders previously expressed concern the pandemic could reduce response rates in low-income neighborhoods which are typically under-counted even further..  Lightfoot said she’s dedicated to getting residents what they need, but the community has to step up..  “We have to do better, we can do better, we have to aim higher and set our sights at doing everything we can to change that 55 percent to a much higher number,” Lightfoot said..  Filling out the census takes about five minutes and can be done online or by phone. The final deadline has been extended to October 31..

1323,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot warned Monday that Chicago was falling short in responding to the 2020 census, threatening millions of dollars in federal aid to the city..  Approximately 55% of Chicagoans have already responded to the census, but that is “not even close to where we need to be,” Lightfoot said, giving the response a letter grade of C — something she said she would never have been satisfied with as a student. “We have to aim higher.”.  Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors In some South and West side neighborhoods, the response rate is 40%, Lightfoot said..  Lightfoot budgeted $2.7 million last year for census “outreach, education and mobilization” to boost the city’s response rate. In October, Lightfoot said she wanted to ensure that 75% of Chicago’s residents are counted. Chicago risks losing $1,400 per year for the next decade for each person missed during the census..  Mayor Lori Lightfoot dons a bright green cowboy hat before introducing a special guest — and his 13-year-old horse — at a press conference Monday, July 13, 2020. (WTTW News).  The city’s census response efforts have been led by well-established community organizations familiar with Chicago’s hard-to-count residents — immigrants, refugees, renters, those who are homeless, people with disabilities, those who don’t speak English, young children, seniors citizens, and college students..  “We need everyone to step up,” Lightfoot said..  However, those efforts were scrambled by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced those organizations to toss out plans to reach out to residents in person and launch digital outreach efforts..  Once again, Lightfoot cast the act of being counted in the 2020 census as a way to stick it to President Donald Trump’s effort to target immigrant communities..  “Don’t let them win,” Lightfoot said. “We win by making sure we are counted.”.  Donning a bright green cowboy hat, Lightfoot enlisted the Dreadhead Cowboy to visit areas with low response rates and urge people to fill out the census, welcoming Adam Hollingsworth and his 13-year-old horse Prince to the news conference to the sounds of the Lil Nas X hit “Old Town Road.”.  Adam Hollingsworth — aka the Dreadhead Cowboy — and his horse Prince make an appearance at a press conference in Chicago on Monday, July 13, 2020. (WTTW News).  A fan of Batman, Lightfoot said she was sounding a “distress signal” like the one used to summon the caped crusader by Gotham Police officials to call on the social media star, the Dreadhead Cowboy..  Hollingsworth found the spotlight during the stay-at-home order by traveling to Chicago neighborhoods, and then drew national attention during the protests touched off by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody..  Hollingsworth will be “compensated for his time, however, he is not being paid by the city,” according to mayoral spokesperson Pat Mullane, who said World Business Chicago would pay the newly renamed Census Cowboy..

1329,"Chicago Tribune | Sep 21, 2020 at 5:00 AM Members of Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot's staff prepare for the city's virtual City Council meeting on April 15, 2020, at City Hall. Forty-one aldermen can be seen on a computer screen. Chicago has a 50-member City Council and some have said the city could save money by reducing that number. (Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) What would be the most honorable, selfless act an Illinois elected official might consider? Probably this: To acknowledge the state’s financial woes and, in the name of overburdened taxpayers, fire oneself. To say publicly what no fiefdom-building politician ever wants to admit: My city and state would be better off without me and my expensive, wasteful bureaucracy. Advertisement Go ahead and roll your eyes, but then applaud Mayor Curtis McCall Jr. of Cahokia near St. Louis, who declares that residents really would benefit if his village along the Mississippi River combined with two nearby communities. “I would have to step down from my position as a mayor, and that wasn’t an easy choice to make because I love serving the citizens in the village of Cahokia,” he said, according to the Belleville News-Democrat. “It wasn’t an easy decision to make, but it was a necessary decision to make.” The idea of consolidating and eliminating units of government in Illinois is the long-standing wish of infuriated watchdogs and exhausted taxpayers. This state has more government units than any other: nearly 7,000 of them, including villages, townships, housing authorities and drainage districts. Every one takes its share of dollars from you, the taxpayers. Many of these taxing bodies operate without much scrutiny and offer services that could be handled by others. Many provide taxpayer-funded pensions. Advertisement At the same time, Illinois is losing population as residents leave for other states with brighter economic opportunities, lower taxes, less corruption and sometimes, yes, warmer weather. We hear frequently from Illinois Exodus seekers and other fed-up residents who fear the downward spiral’s impact. At both the state and local levels, Illinois is deep in debt, yet government entities continue to tax and spend at unsustainable levels. As more Illinoisans leave, and others choose not to come, the burdens rise on those who remain. Fleeing is always an option. “I’m tired of Illinois’ multiple levels of corrupt government and out-of-control spending,” Tribune reader Kevin Bae of Glenview wrote in a recent letter to the editor in which he said goodbye. “People here scream for change but vote the same people into office time and time again.” Two other recent letter-writers focused their attention on government spending, offering specific suggestions for downsizing expensive bureaucracies. Jack Shniderman of Northbrook looked at a map and wondered why Illinois has 102 counties and a population of 12.7 million, while California has 58 counties and a population of 39.5 million. “Like a business merger, if Illinois merged down to 40 or 50 counties, it would save billions by eliminating redundancies in workers, equipment, pensions, elections, transportation and hundreds of other expenses,” he wrote. A Facebook page “Escaping Illinois” boasts nearly 50,000 followers and sells T-shirts, coffee mugs, baby onesies and other merchandise. Its posts often lament the state’s bleak finances. Kathleen Reyes of Chicago took aim at the 50-member City Council. “Most aldermen have staffs of six to eight employees,” she wrote . “We’d save a fortune on salaries and benefits by cutting the City Council to 25 and cutting staffs to a reasonable number.” Idealistic? Improbable? Say what you want, but these are necessary changes for a state not living within its means. As Illinois’ fiscal plight deepens, there’s been some nibbling around the edges of reform. The state recently consolidated hundreds of downstate and suburban police andfire pension funds into two statewide funds. McHenry County and DuPage County have made progress toward dissolving smaller governments within their boundaries. Then there is what Mayor McCall of Cahokia and other realists are doing along the Mississippi River. On Election Day Nov. 3, the voters of Cahokia, Centreville and Alorton will decide whether to merge into one city. The survivor community would be called Cahokia Heights. Afterward, a local township might also be dissolved. The area is losing population and has a high percentage of residents living below the federal poverty line, the News-Democrat said. Consolidating government would save tax dollars and allow the larger community to qualify for more federal funds. “If it’s going to help the residents of Cahokia, Centreville or Alorton, then I’m all for it because right now, our communities are dying,” McCall said. “These are communities of color and we need to do what we need to do to help these communities survive.” Thank you, mayor, for doing what every elected government official in troubled Illinois, should be doing every day: Caring about people and responsible governance, not political fiefdoms.

I own a 1,600 square-foot stick house with a vinyl siding and I’m paying almost $300 a month for the privilege of living in Madison County,” said Granite City resident Steven Laughlin..

Rockford Police Chief Dan O'Shea said at a news conference that the suspect ""willingly"" walked out of the Heritage Credit Union around 9 p.m. CST Friday. The hostage came outside with the suspect and was quickly ushered away by officers..  O'Shea said the hostage was a bank employee and she was taken to a hospital to determine if she had been injured..  Authorities have not released the suspect's identity..  Officials said negotiators from the Rockford police department and the FBI were talking to the suspect during the incident. A Winnebago County SWAT team was also brought to the scene..

Rauner cuts the Illinois Capitol bicentennial cake a year ago with Eli’s Cheesecake President Marc Schulman. Illinois population dropped throughout Rauner’s term in office. (One Illinois/Ted Cox) By Ted Cox Illinois lost population for the sixth straight year and nationally population leveled off at 328 million as immigration fell under President Trump to the lowest level in a decade, according to data released this week by the U.S. Census Bureau. The annual U.S. population estimates released Monday found that as of last July the U.S. population “was 328,239,523 in 2019, growing by 0.5 percent between 2018 and 2019, or 1,552,022 people,” according to a U.S. Census Bureau news release . Although the latest census data find that Illinois is losing fewer residents to other states year to year than before, it is not making up the difference in migration to the state or by births or by adding immigrants — trends reflected across the nation. The Census Bureau reported that just 595,000 international citizens came to America last year — the lowest level of the 2010s. The United States attracted more than 1 million new international residents in both 2015 and 2016 under President Obama, but that figure has fallen every year under Trump. The 595,000 new immigrants last year was a drop from 702,000 the year before, and fell below the 698,000 new U.S. residents registered in 2010. The number of new U.S. immigrants dropped last year under President Trump to the lowest level of the 2010s. (One Illinois/Ted Cox) At the same time, the so-called natural increase in population — in which births outnumber deaths — fell to the lowest level in 40 years. “So far this decade, natural increase has been the largest source of population growth for the nation,” the Census Bureau stated in another news release . “In 2019, natural increase dropped to 957,000, marking the first time in at least four decades that it slipped below a million, continuing the trend toward fewer births and more deaths.” “While natural increase is the biggest contributor to the U.S. population increase, it has been slowing over the last five years,” said Sandra Johnson, a demographer and statistician in the Population Division of the Census Bureau. “Natural increase, or when the number of births is greater than the number of deaths, dropped below 1 million in 2019 for the first time in decades.” Illinois remained in sixth place nationally among the states with 12.7 million residents, down 51,250 from last year’s estimates and down 159,700 from the last formal U.S. Census in 2010 — 1.2 percent of the state’s population. The state remained ahead of Ohio in seventh place, but Ohio closed to within 1 million. The population drop also continued to accelerate, as last year the state registered a 45,000 decline . New York State lost more actual residents than Illinois this year, 77,000, and West Virginia lost a larger share of its population, 0.7 percent compared to the 0.4 percent drop registered in Illinois and New York. The Chicago Tribune cited the latest Census data showing that Illinois continues to lag behind other states in attracting new residents from elsewhere in the nation, ranking 46th. But it actually improved substantially in the number of residents moving out of Illinois to other states, ranking 32nd. The bureau will release more detailed information on states and counties later this year as it also prepares to conduct the formal headcount of the 2020 U.S. Census. Illinois and Chicago have both been hurt by the dwindling immigration figures. “China replaced Mexico to become the largest (source) of foreign-born immigrants to the United States as of 2018,” the bureau stated in another release . “At the beginning of the decade, Mexico was the largest, but immigration from Mexico has dropped significantly since the recession at the end of the last decade. “Since 2010, immigration from China and India has either approached or surpassed Mexican immigration levels,” the release added, “while immigration from Canada has remained relatively unchanged.” It should be pointed out that Illinois’s six-year skid on population loss spanned all four years of former Gov. Bruce Rauner’s term in office, while less that six months of the latest estimates included the term of new Gov. J.B. Pritzker. Pritzker is hoping to stem that tide with an overhaul of the state’s funding and taxation system — which will go before voters in November — and the legalization of marijuana that took effect New Year’s Day can’t hurt either when it comes to luring new residents to Illinois.

This year’s most important referendum is taking place in November in Illinois, where pro-spending lobbies are very anxious to repeal the state’s flat tax ..  If they succeed, the steady flow of taxpayers out of Illinois will become a torrent..  That’s because the flat tax is the only semi-decent feature of the state’s fiscal policy.

1338,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently announced $700,000 in grant funding for 32 community-based organizations to support the city’s efforts in educating and engaging residents about the upcoming 2020 U.S. Census. The city partnered with Forefront’s IL Count Me In 2020 initiative to disperse a portion of its $2.7 million Census investment – the largest amount of funding Chicago has ever committed to the Census – to grant funding for community organizations. These grant funds will be used to support targeted community outreach and other initiatives to help increase Census participation for hard-to-count communities. The City of Chicago contributed $500,000 toward this community outreach effort, Uber provided an additional $100,000, the Illinois Department of Aging contributed $75,000 and the McCormick Foundation contributed $25,000..  Grant funds will be used by organizations for outreach within the City’s hardest-to-count community areas. Awardees will leverage grant dollars for community events, social media campaigns, accessible materials, and other on-the-ground outreach designed to build awareness and activate Chicago residents to complete the 2020 Census..  “Achieving a full and fair count in the upcoming census is critical to determining the necessary federal funding levels for our city, appropriate representation in Congress, and securing the continued strength of our regional economy,” said Mayor Lightfoot. “These grants stand as a vital tool to supporting Chicago’s many passionate and committed community partners who will be on the ground and working hard to include all our residents in this important process, and ensuring every voice is heard, felt and accounted for.”.  “It has been an honor to work closely with Mayor Lightfoot’s team and the City of Chicago to ensure these funds support communities not yet reached through our statewide Illinois Count Me In 2020 Funders’ Collaborative, state funding, or funding from Cook County,” said Forefront President and CEO Eric Weinheimer. “These grantees have demonstrated a clear commitment to educating and activating their communities around a complete count. Forefront looks forward to supporting these grantees as we prepare for Illinois’ Census count this spring.”.  Nearly half of Chicago’s 2.7 million residents are considered “hard-to-count” by the U.S. Census Bureau. This includes families of color, children under five, the elderly, veterans, returning residents, individuals with high rates of mobility and housing instability, residents with disabilities, those with limited access to the Internet, and those who may be afraid to participate..  An accurate count is vital for Chicago as it determines whether the city receives an appropriate level of representation in Congress, as well as the funding that is instrumental to maintaining infrastructure, public safety, public health, and other city services. Funding for many programs benefitting Chicagoans is allocated based on the Census, including Medicaid, Head Start, SNAP, Section 8, Title I and Special Education Grants. The City of Chicago stands to lose $1,400 each year for every resident missed in 2020, with other adverse implications in redistricting..

1340,"Online forms available March 12 By MORRIS HERALD-NEWS 1:30 pm.  Illinois residents can begin filling out their census forms online this week..  The Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) announced the first day to complete the 2020 census online will be Thursday, March 12 at my2020census.gov . The online questionnaire is the quickest and easiest way to get counted in Illinois and can be accessed from a smart phone, tablet, laptop, computer and terminals at local libraries..  Grundy County received an administrative grant to provide laptops at select locations to make it easier for residents to complete the census. In Grundy County, residents who do not have access to the internet can still fill out forms online through stations available at the following locations:.  • Fossil Ridge Library, Braidwood.  • Three Rivers Library, both Channahon and Minooka.  • Morris Public Library.  • Grundy County Health Department waiting room.  • We Care of Grundy County.  The census is nine questions long and will take less than 10 minutes to complete..  “It is extremely important that everyone knows the implications of the census and gets counted in Illinois,” said IDHS Secretary Grace B. Hou. “Completing the census online will ensure that Illinoisans get both the representation and federal funding for the critical services that they deserve.”.  An accurate count of Illinois' population is essential to ensure the State receives the funding needed to properly care for its residents and provide critical services and programs..  In 2015, Illinois received $19.7 billion or approximately $1,535 per capita, in federal assistance for 16 programs..  Failure to count every Illinois resident will have devastating effects on Illinois' ability to meet the needs of its residents. Even a 1% undercount would result in the loss of $19.5 million per year, for a decade, resulting in a total loss of $195.5 million for the State of Illinois..  The number of seats Illinois has in the U.S. House of Representatives for the next 10 years will also be determined by the census count this year..  In June, Governor Pritzker signed an executive order that established the Census Office within IDHS and an advisory panel to guide public outreach. The $29 million approved for 2020 census efforts in Illinois is the largest per capita investment of any state in the nation this year, and is funded through the bipartisan FY20 budget..  IDHS has already awarded $20 million dollars in grants to over 350 local and community organizations to reach every corner of Illinois.

1341,"Former House candidate Mike Babcock, a Republican, dreams of the day when Springfield is more about service and less about politics..  “I think we need to see a fast exit from the likes of people such as (House Speaker) Mike Madigan,” Babcock told the Metro East Sun . “We need someone who truly cares about the people of the state and not just being in power.”.  Babcock views Democrats' dogged push for a progressive tax to replace the current flat tax system as leading to just more of the same taxpayer abuse..  Even as Gov. J.B. Pritzker continues to insist that the progressive tax he has been promoting since his days as a candidate will only mean higher taxes for the state’s richest residents, recent analysis by Illinois Policy Institute (IPI) finds that if it were to ever become law, it would easily wipe out all the 45,000 net jobs the state gained in 2019..  In all, IPI pegs the losses as in the neighborhood of more than 56,000 jobs..  “A tax like this is only designed to penalize people,” Babcock said. ""But over time, it will only keep people moving out of Illinois. Any time you have a shrinking population and are losing jobs and businesses, it’s not a lasting way. In the end, the burden will only fall on those that are still here.”.  In early November, voters across Illinois can have their voices heard on the issue when they go to the polls to vote on the question of if the state Constitution should be amended to allow lawmakers the power to enact a progressive tax system as a replacement to the current flat tax..  Between then and now, Babcock said he expects Democrats to do all they can to get the tax over the finish line..  “Quite frankly, they can’t help themselves,” he said. “They just can’t restrain themselves when it comes to spending. They see money and their impulse is to spend more, but you can’t account for any of it being spent in areas that might be needed. It’s just raise taxes and spend some more, that’s their whole strategy.” Weekly Newsletter Sign-up and get latest news about the courts, judges and latest complaints - right to your inbox.

1346,"https://ift.tt/3160Z8q.  DEKALB – American Farmland Trust, the organization behind the national movement “No Farms No Food,” will partner with The Nature Conservancy to provide over $100,000 for the adoption of regenerative farming practices in Illinois. This will be done through enhanced partnerships, testing of innovative programs, expanding technical and financial assistance for farmers, and evaluation of the success of these efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, or GHG. The funds are from the generous support of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation..  “The U.S. Natural Climate Solutions accelerator grant will provide American Farmland Trust the opportunity to accelerate the adoption of practices proven to provide climate benefits, such as cover crops, by catalyzing cooperation among public agencies and private partners around the efficient use of financial and technical assistance,” notes Kristopher Reynolds, AFT Midwest regional director. “We are excited to leverage our work with current partners to increase the adoption of regenerative farming practices in Illinois.”.  Megan Baskerville, TNC Illinois ag program director, said AFT’s innovative accelerator project will give Illinois’ agriculture community even more ways to understand, and account for, the myriad co-benefits soil health practices deliver. “This will result in the ultimate goal – more conservation on the ground,” she said..  AFT will use the COMET-Planner tool emission reduction coefficients and county level 2017 Census of Agriculture data to determine the scalable GHG mitigation potential. Over the next 15 months, this project seeks to incorporate soil carbon storage and GHG mitigation as quantifiable outcomes alongside state water quality targets, signifying a continued commitment to simultaneously achieving the goals of the Illinois Nutrient Loss Reduction Strategy and the U.S. Climate Alliance..  Through this project, they hope to achieve the following: Accelerate adoption of regenerative farming practices in Illinois, sequestering more than 8 million metric tonnes of CO2e during the 15-month project period. Strengthen existing partner networks and outline methodologies to incorporate GHG impacts into proposed projects. Increase alignment of state and federal conservation funds with the practices and locations that provide the most cost-effective climate and water quality benefits and identify private partnerships to leverage existing funding..  AFT will utilize existing programs such as the Saving Tomorrow’s Agricultural Resources (S.T.A.R.) Initiative and Illinois Department of Agriculture “Fall Covers for Spring Savings” Cover Crop Premium Discount Program to open pathways for leveraging funds from private corporations and foundations. These funds will benefit AFT’s and TNC’s partnerships including The Illinois Sustainable Agriculture Partnership, a coalition of conservation nonprofits including commodity associations and research institutions. The key to unlocking these funds lies in the ability to demonstrate the “most bang for the buck” regarding cost-effective environmental outcomes..  AFT will track practices implemented and quantify the GHG impacts from project activities alongside soil health and water quality co-benefits, providing a prioritization framework to guide future program implementation and prioritization of regenerative agriculture practices at the field level..  via Mendota Reporter.

1347,"CHICAGO (CBS)– With less than three weeks until Election Day, early voting sites are now open in all 50 wards in Chicago ..  In light of the pandemic, there’s been a major push urging Americans to vote by mail or vote early for the Nov. 3 elections..  Two weeks ago, the only place you could vote early in Chicago was at the Loop Super Site. That changes starting today, as people can now vote early at any of 51 sites in Chicago – the Loop Super Site and early voting centers in all 50 wards..  So far, more than 13,300 people have voted early at the Loop Super Site. Long lines quickly formed this morning at many of the early voting sites that are now open..  This morning, at the 26 th Ward early voting site, many people lined up even before the doors opened at 8:30 a.m. They said they didn’t want to wait until the last minute to cast their ballot..  “Old school, you know? My parents and my forefathers. This is a privilege, and a right, and I’m not going to dishonor it by not voting,” voter David McGowan said..  At the 25 th Ward early voting site, local officials encouraged people to vote as soon as possible..  Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25 th ) urged people in the area to speak up for the immigrant community by making sure they vote this year..  “For everybody else who can vote, please exercise the right to vote early. We have just a few weeks to make sure that we make a difference in our communities. And please do not forget to fill out the Census tomorrow. This is a coalition that has been working for months, and we continue to make sure that we get people out to vote. Again, staying at home is not an option,” he said..  Even if you’re not registered to vote, you can still go any of the 50 early voting sites to register and then cast your ballot. To register, you’ll need to bring two forms of ID, including one that lists your current address..  All 50 early voting sites in Chicago are open from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays, and 9 p.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. They also will be open on Election Day from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m..  All early voting site locations are listed on the Chicago Board of Elections website..  Voting by mail has been extremely popular this year, with the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners receiving 497,640 vote by mail applications as of Wednesday morning, the most ever. That’s more than quadruple the 118,000 vote by mail applications from the March primary. The previous record for voting by mail in a general election in Chicago was 116,117 applications in for the November 1944 election during World War II.","[0.5291669368743896, 0.4708331227302551]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5291669368743896
1348,"U.S. Supreme Court scuttles census after Illinois commits $1 million to outreach RAYMON TRONCOSO rtroncoso@capitolnewsillinois.com Save.  SPRINGFIELD — The U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration could shorten the U.S. Census count on Tuesday, just hours after the Illinois government committed an additional $1 million to outreach..  The Trump administration originally tried to shorten the end date of the census to Sept. 30, but federal courts mandated the administration keep the count going until Oct. 31, the extended deadline originally set by the federal government in response to the coronavirus pandemic. However, following the 7-1 SCOTUS ruling, the U.S. Census Bureau announced it was ending the count at 5 a.m. Friday in Illinois..  The Census Bureau will continue to accept self-responses from Illinoisans online at My2020Census.gov through that 5 a.m. deadline and will accept phone responses and paper forms postmarked by Oct. 15..  Gov. JB Pritzker tweeted about the ruling shortly after its announcement, calling the decision “wrong” and saying it could lead to “an undercount in communities that can least afford it, perpetuating generations of disinvestment that make our nation weaker.”.  Enumeration, or the total rate of households being counted in the census, is currently at 99.9 percent for the U.S. and Illinois, according to the Census Bureau. However, census outreach advocates say that the self-response is a more reliable measure for an accurate count..  “It’s not an exact science,” said Anita Banerji, director of the Democracy Initiative at Forefront, which conducts census outreach in Illinois..  According to Banerji, multiple factors and situations can affect enumeration tallies conducted by census agents. People living in nursing homes, college campuses and prisons can skew totals. The coronavirus pandemic has displaced families and killed thousands in Illinois over the course of the census count..  “Getting to that 99 percent when you think about all the different challenges we’ve had, it’s not an exact number,” Banerji said. “So for all intents and purposes, we as advocates focus on the self-response number because we know that to be more of a tried and true number.”.  Illinois’ self-response rate sits at 71.2 percent as of Tuesday, the 7th highest in the nation, and the state is the most populous in the top 10 for self-response. In 2010, the state’s self-response rate was 70.5 percent. More from this section ","[0.6663445830345154, 0.3336554169654846]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6663445830345154
1349,"Illinois State Capitol in Springfield (benkrut/Getty Images Plus).  Rather surprisingly, Illinois’s state income tax is a flat tax, charged at 4.95 percent. That may change if a ballot measure for November proposed by the state’s Democratic governor, J. B. Pritzker (a billionaire from the Hyatt hotel dynasty), and backed by the Democratic legislature, is approved. The measure would replace the flat rate with a “progressive” structure topping out at 7.99 percent, the so-called “Fair Tax.” There will be a new lower rate of 4.75 percent, but observed the Wall Street Journal , “taxpayers in that range can expect savings barely enough for an order of deep-dish pizza.”.  Flat taxes are, in my view, a good thing. As I argued on the Capital Note the other day in the course of discussing this initiative:.  One of most interesting aspects of these proposals is the suggested move away from a flat tax. Apart from a flat tax’s simplicity and (to me) the virtue that its progressivity operates at only one level (wealthier taxpayers will still pay more tax, just not at a higher rate), it also comes with the advantage of ensuring that all taxpayers have at least some skin in the game, something that is appropriate both on grounds of (to use a much-abused term) ‘fairness,’ and because it increases the political cost of increasing that tax. Put another way, it provides an incentive only to increase taxes when truly necessary..  If, on the other hand, the bulk of the tax increase falls on a relatively narrow sliver of taxpayers, then the political cost of increasing that tax will be low, even more so if those hardest hit by the increase are more likely to be political opponents of those proposing the tax hike..  As the Journal suggests, a move to a progressive income tax would be likely to lead Illinois into a growing reliance on affluent taxpayers. New York’s experience demonstrates that dependency on the wealthy can come to look distinctly lopsided. According to E. J. McMahon, senior fellow at the Empire Center for Public Policy, the top 1 percent of earners pay 40 percent of New York’s income taxes and 47 percent of New York City’s income taxes..  Such a degree of dependence leaves New York vulnerable, for obvious reasons. And for equally obvious reasons, it’s worth asking whether Illinois’s wealthier taxpayers will hang around to enjoy making their increased “contributions” to their state’s battered coffers. They, after all, often fall into a category of taxpayer able to move fairly easily elsewhere, something that was true even before the increased possibilities of working from home that may become a permanent feature of the employment landscape after COVID-19..  The Wall Street Journal :.  Illinois led the nation in out-migration over the past decade, with its population declining in each of the past six years, according to the Census Bureau.

Google Street View technology presents a novel method for assessing neighborhood physical disorder but has not been previously examined in the context of birth outcomes. In this cross-sectional study, trained raters used Google's Street View imagery to virtually audit a randomly sampled block within each Chicago census tract (n = 809) for nine indicators of physical disorder. We used an item-response theory model and spatial interpolation to calculate tract-level neighborhood physical disorder scores across Chicago. We linked these data with geocoded electronic health record data from a large, academic women's hospital in Chicago (2015-2017, n = 14,309 births). We used three-level hierarchical Poisson regression to estimate prevalence ratios for the associations of neighborhood physical disorder with preterm birth (overall and spontaneous), small for gestational age (SGA), and hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP). After adjustment for maternal sociodemographics, multiparity, and season of birth, living in a neighborhood with high physical disorder was associated with higher prevalence of PTB, SGA, and HDP (prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals 1.21 (1.06, 1.39) for PTB, 1.13 (1.01, 1.37) for SGA, and 1.23 (1.07, 1.42) for HDP). Adjustment for neighborhood poverty and maternal health conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, asthma, substance use) attenuated associations. Results suggest that an adverse neighborhood physical environment may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, future work is needed to disentangle the unique contribution of physical disorder from other characteristics of disadvantaged neighborhoods.","[0.7606432437896729, 0.23935675621032715]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.7606432437896729

1358,"December 05, 2019 Lara Bryant A radish (root) is a great cover crop for breaking up hard-packed soil. Lara Bryant.  With winter approaching and harvests ending, it’s a good time to show extra reverence for soil, the life-giving layer of the Earth with many special superpowers—like growing our food, to name the one that comes first to mind..  What better way to revere soil than rewarding farmers who have invested in it by planting cover crops? So we are overjoyed to report that the Illinois Department of Agriculture has just announced that sign-up is open for its brand new crop insurance savings program. The program will reward Illinois farmers who planted cover crops this fall with $5 per acre to go toward paying their crop insurance bills next year. The Illinois program follows the model of Iowa’s three-year demonstration pilot ; farmers have until January 15 th , 2020, to enroll acres planted in cover crops this fall and save on their crop insurance next summer, and the program is funded for up to 50,000 acres of cover crops (for reference, the average farm size in Illinois is 372 acres according to the 2017 Census of Agriculture )..  Cover-cropping is the practice of keeping living roots in the ground after the last cash-crop has been harvested, so that the soil isn’t left bare over the winter. Cover crops hold the soil in the ground and improve its biology, chemical function, and physical structure. Cover crops regenerate the soil and often improve farm profits in return..  If cover crops are so great, you may ask, why aren’t all farmers planting them? One of the major reasons is cost. Cover crop seed costs around $35 per acre on average; if a farmer is going to make that type of investment, they need to know they will see a return. While $5 per acre won’t cover the whole cost of cover crops, it will help farmers a lot to save on crop insurance. (For reference, see this resource from the University of Illinois ; a typical crop insurance premium policy might cost the farmer about $13 so a $5 per acre reduction would make a significant reduction the crop insurance bill). In Illinois, about 80% of farmland is enrolled in crop insurance. Linking one of the most commonly-used federal farm programs to cover crops may help Illinois farmers make the decision to go that extra mile and rewards farmers who are already investing in the long-term viability of the land..  This program also takes a small step toward meeting its nutrient loss reduction strategy goals , as cover crops are a key practice for reducing polluted runoff from agricultural land . According to Kris Reynolds at American Farmland Trust, “Cover crops are one of the main in-field management practices listed in the Illinois Nutrient Loss Reduction Strategy as having the potential to reduce nutrient losses by at least 30%.”.  NRDC has long-supported crop insurance incentives as a way to get more cover crops on the ground; we collaborated with our partners at American Farmland Trust and a number of Illinois groups to champion this program for farmers in the state..

The program consists of three project-based classes that begins with immersing sophomores in self-discovery and reflection before the social entrepreneurship program as juniors, which teaches kids to start a business with a positive social impact..  In their final year, students complete a senior capstone that merges everything from the past two years into a culminating project that showcases their research, social impact and growth..  “Social entrepreneurship, I created that from scratch,” Sitze said. “It’s the only class where kids run a business in the state. I haven’t seen anyone else doing it, maybe in the country. No others have social benefits asking how the market can solve problems.”.  The social entrepreneurship students started the census program last year and educated the community as well as themselves. Sitze was proud of how his kids threw themselves at the objective, even during the pandemic..  The students that created businesses during the spring had to either fold or pivot their businesses due to COVID-19..  “They evolved and didn’t give up,” Sitze said. “One girl took old t-shirts and started making face masks after it hit and she made hundreds. For every one she sold, she gave one away. Others changed their business practices to be COVID-19-safe. They just pivoted.”.  Those with businesses that had to fold created District Delivery, which collaborated with Ogle County organizations to deliver groceries safely to those that couldn’t or didn’t want to go out..  When summer came, the students kept at the delivery service, even without grades or payment for it..  “When we empower kids to create change, they’re good assets,” Sitze said. “The adults had their plates full. I was floored by their creativity and commitment.” enter October's Sauk Valley's cutest pet contest Now-Oct. 19, submit a photo of your cute pet. Voting is Oct. 20-26.

1367,"Redistricting will likely cost Illinois a congressional district.  By Danny Connolly, Staff Reporter October 16, 2020.  Edited Oct. 16 1:27 p.m. to correct the last name of a candidate.  Illinois will likely lose a congressional district after the results of the 2020 census come out..  Redistricting is a process every state goes through to make sure that each congressional district represents roughly the same number of people..  Advertisement.  After all 50 states are given one seat, the Census uses a formula called the Method of Equal Proportions to hand out the remaining 385 seats..  “The apportionment machine rates the population of the states according to the Census. Then the machine starts giving out seats. After each seat is distributed, the machine reranks the states based on the formula, until all seats are distributed. This ensures that each congressional district, from Maryland to California, has roughly the same number of people,” The United States Census Bureau said in a video called “The U.S. Census and the Amazing Apportionment Machine.”.  Illinois has been steadily losing congressional seats since the 1970 census, where it had 24 congressional seats..  This has also been affecting Illinois’s power in the Electoral College to elect a president..  According to John Jackson, a professor of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute, the most likely district to be cut is the 15th, because the current representative, John Shminkus, is not running for re-election..  “Redistricting always starts by trying to protect the incumbents. So it’s going to be hard not to look at the 15th as most vulnerable, to be folded into parts of the 12th, 13th and whatever else it takes,” Jackson said..  The two candidates for the 15th district representative are Republican Mary Miller and Democrat Erika Weaver. The 2020 election will take place in the 15th district normally like all other congressional races, but the winner of the race may not have a district to campaign in the 2022 election..  The Illinois state legislature will be drawing the map once it receives data from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 31st, 2021..  “Our districts are going to be big. The question is, how do they get cut up,” Jackson said. “Do they come out looking, what’s called compact and contiguous, do they take care to watch for county boundaries or city boundaries, or do they make sense, when you look at the map, when the new map is drawn.”.  A bill to establish an independent redistricting commission, called the “Fair Maps Amendment” received bipartisan support in both the Illinois House of Representatives and Senate, including from state Rep. Terri Bryant of Mt. Vernon and state senators Dale Fowler of Harrisburg and Paul Schimpf of Murphysboro..  The Illinois legislature did not convene in the spring session to vote on the Fair Maps Amendment or anything else due to COVID-19..

1369,"Pritzker calls on local officials to help enforce stay-at-home order.  By BEN ORNER Capitol News Illinois.  SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois Department of Public Health on Sunday reported the state’s highest one-day total of COVID-19 tests with 19,417 completed in the past 24 hours..  For more than a week, the state has met its long-stated goal of 10,000 daily tests, a trend Gov. JB Pritzker has said is key to incrementally lifting the stay-at-home order and other social and economic restrictions. Since the outbreak began, 319,313 tests have been completed..  IDPH also reported 2,994 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday and 63 new deaths, bringing the state’s totals to 61,499 and 2,618, respectively. Ninety-seven of Illinois’ 102 counties have reported cases and 45 have reported deaths. Many of those infected, however, have recovered..  As of midnight Saturday, 4,701 people were in Illinois hospitals with the novel coronavirus. Of those patients, 1,232 were in an intensive care unit, while 759 were on ventilators..  Although the majority of Illinois COVID-19 cases have been reported in Cook County and the collar counties, the virus remains prevalent downstate when looking at cases per capita..  When comparing IDPH data to the latest population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, the top five counties for cases per 1,000 residents are Cook (8.22), Lake (5.97) and then the downstate counties of Randolph (5.63), Jasper (4.68) and Warren (4.63)..  Pritzker encourages local enforcement.  In his daily COVID-19 briefing Sunday in Chicago, Pritzker encouraged local police to help enforce the statewide stay-at-home order amid reports of large parties in Chicago and Peoria..  Pritzker called upon police departments across the state to break up parties and large gatherings..  “We need local government and local police to make sure that people are following these rules,” Pritzker said, adding that “we need the public to comply with the stay-at-home rule because that is how we’ve been defeating coronavirus.”.  “We’re not looking to have police crack down on people, arrest people, that is not the intent here,” the governor said. “But it is true that police can break up a party and should.”.  Pritzker also added that “we’ll provide State Police (as) backup whenever they need it.”.  The governor acknowledged later in the briefing that enforcement abilities become trickier when groups of people number in the thousands..  “I certainly don’t want to put anybody in danger by suggesting that law enforcement needs to go break up a group of 3,000,” Pritzker said. “On the other hand, it is against the order and law enforcement does have that ability.”.  He also warned of the possible danger that such a large gathering could have on public health..  “One person in the middle of that 3,000 can cause many others to get infected and each one of those people has the ability to infect others,” he said..  “People should follow the rules here, and in relatively short order we’ll begin to see, as the economy opens up, things will get better for everyone.”.  Future federal funding.  President Donald Trump has hinted that future coronavirus aid to states could hinge on states’ actions regarding other matters, such as cracking down on sanctuary cities..  “I don’t know whether there will be strings attached,” Pritzker said Sunday morning in an appearance on CBS’s “Face The Nation.” “I hope there aren’t too many because the fact is every state has a problem and it’s different in every state where they need to put the dollars. So putting more strings on it makes it much more difficult for us to move forward to get our economies going.”.  Illinois Senate President Don Harmon, a Democrat from Oak Park, asked the state’s federal lawmakers in April to consider giving more than $41 billion in funding to the state as part of the next coronavirus relief package, including $10 billion to stabilize Illinois’ underfunded pension system..  Pritzker said in his Sunday briefing that he is leaving negotiations on future aid up to Illinois’ federal representatives, but he added that “we should try to leave politics out of this and instead look at what the damage is that’s been done to all the states – those who are represented by Republicans, those who are represented by Democrats – and try to help them, all of us, fill the hole that’s been made by coronavirus.”.  Also on the topic of federal funding, Pritzker on Sunday reminded Illinoisans to fill out the U.S. Census forms that arrived in their mailboxes in April. According to the latest data from the Census Bureau, 61.6 percent of Illinoisans have responded to this year’s census..  “I want to encourage everyone to do their part in ensuring you and all Illinoisans get your fair share of federal funding and are fully represented,” Pritzker said, stressing that federal dollars given to states are often based on population counts..  Illinois’ response rate to the census ranks ninth in the nation and is above the national average of 56.3 percent. The state’s response rate during the previous census in 2010 was 70.5 percent..

1371,"To suggest that having politicians draw maps privately better protects Latinos and other people of color is to defy the evidence. May 5, 2020, 12:53pm CDT Liliana Scales and Deborah Harrington Share this story The State Capitol Building in Springfield File photo In a recent letter to the Chicago Sun-Times, several Illinois Latino legislators claimed that an independent redistricting commission to produce political maps would somehow harm and silence Latino voters and other people of color, that politicians producing maps in private was preferred, and that independent commissioners would be well-connected and wealthy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Opinion It should be noted that CHANGE Illinois met with each of the 13 Latino lawmakers who signed the letter to listen to and address their concerns. We also, repeatedly, asked to meet with the the Legislature’s Latino caucus to engage in a discussion about improving redistricting, but were rebuffed. That’s ironic given that these very same elected officials say they worry an independent process would somehow silence Latino voices. We remained hopeful that some Latino lawmakers would support independent mapping because several signers of their letter previously sponsored fair mapping efforts or had publicly supported independent redistricting in their candidate questionnaires. To suggest having politicians draw maps privately will better protect Latinos and other communities of color defies evidence elsewhere. The Fair Maps Amendment that our statewide coalition, CHANGE Illinois, advocated for was developed after engaging with more than 30 diverse groups from across the state, including several with a Latino community focus. The amendment requires that commissioners conduct their work in public, hold 30 hearings around the state, and respond to input from residents before approving maps. The 2020 amendment included some of the strongest protections for communities of color in the nation. It mandated upholding both the federal and Illinois Voting Rights acts. It ended prison gerrymandering by counting people who are incarcerated at their home addresses. It required that the commission must reflect the ethnic, gender, and racial demographics of the state. Public employees who report directly to an elected or appointed official could not serve on the commission. These protections were put in place to ensure that communities of color and all Illinoisans would be fairly and equitably represented. Our proposed independent redistricting commission was modeled after California’s. Eleven of the 14 commissioners who drew maps in California after the 2010 census were people of color (four were Asian-Americans, three were Latinx, two were African American, one was a Pacific Islander and one was Native American). This occurred even though California lacks the diversity protections embodied in our Fair Maps Amendment. California’s commission included: a veteran, a lawyer for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a second-generation Asian-American, nonprofit professionals and urban planners — all people from varying backgrounds who are not “wealthy and well-connected,” as the Latino lawmakers’ letter suggests would happen. Most significantly, the maps produced by California’s independent commissioners resulted in the election of nine more people of color than had occurred when politicians drew maps. And now, because the opportunity to allow votes on the Fair Maps Amendment has passed, Illinoisans won’t be able to vote on whether they would prefer an independent redistricting commission to draw maps, a process that would have removed politics and politicians from the process. So, what now? Well, we wait to see how the U.S. Census enumeration will delay the redistricting process. If Census data is delayed, a clause in the state’s constitution could kick in that could result in a random selection which would give Democrats and Republicans a 50-50 shot at controlling political map drawing. That process surely will drown out many Illinoisans’ voices. Our statewide coalition will continue to do all that we can to push for an equitable and transparent process for drawing maps through legislative efforts. And we hope all of our Latino lawmakers will understand that sunshine and open engagement in a mapping process is far superior for people of color and for all Illinoisans than politicians drawing lines behind closed doors. Liliana Scales is the advocacy director and Deborah Harrington is the board co-chair of CHANGE Illinois, a nonpartisan nonprofit supporting the creation of an independent citizens redistricting commission to draw political maps for the next 10 years.

1372,"(Meagan Davis / Wikimedia Commons).  A high-profile effort to convince Illinois lawmakers to change the way the state draws congressional and state legislative districts has fizzled out after the coronavirus pandemic shut down the General Assembly..   Madeleine Doubek, a former journalist and executive director of Change Illinois , said it was “disheartening and frustrating” to see Sunday’s deadline for action by the Illinois House and Senate pass without a single committee hearing..  “It was a strange feeling,” Doubek said. “But we saw it coming.”.  The new maps are set to take effect for the 2022 elections based on the results of the 2020 census. Legislative districts are redrawn every 10 years to reflect population and demographic changes..  Doubek said the coalition of good government advocates and state lawmakers remain committed to changing the way state legislative districts are drawn in an effort to protect democracy and return power to voters..  The so-called Fair Maps amendment would no longer allow lawmakers to draw their own districts — a process that has created maps designed to benefit the party in power, as well as constrain its opposition..  Instead, the proposed amendment called for a 17-member commission appointed by the chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court and the most senior Supreme Court justice of the opposing political party to draw legislative maps..  Audra Wilson, the executive director of the Illinois chapter of the League of Women Voters , said it was especially frustrating because the campaign had built up real momentum before the pandemic halted Illinois politics..  “Are we going to have to wait another 10 years?” Wilson said. “A lot of people are asking that question.”.  Advocates of the amendment are not launching a signature drive to put the question to voters — in 2014 and 2016 redistricting ballot initiatives were eventually found unconstitutional because they did not meet the standard that constitutional amendments initiated by a massive citizen-led petition drive make “structural” and “procedural” changes to the legislature..  Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said he’d veto any map that isn’t fair but has yet to detail what criteria he would use to make that determination..  With the deadline in the rearview mirror, Doubek said the Fair Maps coalition would turn its attention to more modest legislative fixes, including a proposal that would ask the General Assembly to appoint an independent commission to draw the maps. The final districts would still have to be approved by the Illinois House and Senate, and signed into law by Pritzker..  That would give members of the public a chance to meaningfully weigh in on the maps before they were approved — and force the discussions usually held behind closed doors to take place at open meetings, Doubek said..  But advocates are also concerned the impact of the pandemic could have a more foundational impact on the effort to redraw Illinois’ legislative districts by delaying the data needed to craft the maps..  Federal officials put off hiring and training temporary census takers in mid-March, and those workers are not scheduled to start knocking on the doors of people who haven’t answered the online questionnaire until August because of the pandemic..  The U.S. Census Bureau officials have said they will not finish the once-in-a-decade count until the end of October , three months behind schedule..  That delay prompted officials to ask Congress to approve their plan to delay the release of data to the states until the end of July 2021..  But that means Illinois will miss another crucial deadline: June 30, 2021. That’s the final day for the Illinois General Assembly to approve new maps..  If lawmakers cannot act because they do not have new data, state law requires the leaders of the legislature to appoint an eight-member commission made up of four Democrats and four Republicans to craft the maps. Those maps do not need the approval of the General Assembly — or Pritzker, according to state law..  That has happened four times in Illinois history — and in all but one case, the commission found itself deadlocked along party lines..  To break that tie, the constitution calls for a name to be pulled from a hat — giving Democrats and Republicans a 50-50 shot at controlling Illinois politics for the next decade..  “I’m very concerned,” said Jay Young, the executive director of Common Cause Illinois . “I’m super worried about when we will get real data. Everyone should be worried.”.

1376,"Supreme Court Won’t Review Ruling Against Homeless Camping Ban.  Circuit Judge Joseph Loper said it was ""troubling” that prosecutors had not responded to a defense motion to drop the charges against Flowers. He said if prosecutors do not respond, “the state will reap the whirlwind” from him..  Assistant District Attorney William Hopper left the courtroom without speaking to news reporters. Earlier, he declined to comment when asked if the district attorney's office would try Flowers a seventh time..  Flowers' attorney Rob McDuff said after the hearing that a person who wanted to remain anonymous was putting up the standard 10% percent, or $250,000, required for Flowers' release. McDuff said Flowers could be freed later Monday..  Supporters who were among the more than 150 people packing the wooden pews of the 1970s-era courtroom hugged Flowers after the judge announced his decision. His father, Archie Lee Flowers, choked back tears. He said the first thing he would do when his son was released, was pray..  The elder Flowers said he frequently visited his son in prison, where they sang and prayed together. He said he has always believed in his son’s innocence..  During his sixth trial in 2010, Flowers was sentenced to death. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned that conviction in June, finding that prosecutors had shown an unconstitutional pattern of excluding African American jurors in the trials of Flowers, who is black..  After the Supreme Court ruling, Flowers was moved off death row at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman and taken to a regional jail in the central Mississippi town of Louisville..  “This case is unprecedented in the history of the American legal system,” McDuff told the judge during Monday's hearing. He said Flowers had spent 23 years in prison “without a lawful conviction to justify his incarceration” and had an “exemplary” record of good behavior in prison..  Hopper had asked the judge to deny bond. He cited several examples of evidence that he said pointed to Flowers' guilt..  Four people were shot to death on July 16, 1996, in the Tardy Furniture store in the north Mississippi city of Winona. They were owner Bertha Tardy, 59, and three employees: 45-year-old Carmen Rigby, 42-year-old Robert Golden and 16-year-old Derrick ""Bobo"" Stewart..  A daughter of Tardy was in court Monday. She sat across the aisle and one row back from Flowers' daughter, Crystal Ghoston, who sat in the front row..  Ghoston, 26, told The Associated Press that she had seen her father only once since he was imprisoned: about 10 years ago, and even then she could only talk to him through a reinforced window. She said they wrote letters to each other and spoke on the phone every few weeks, and that he talked about meeting her 2-year-old daughter, who calls him “Paw-Paw.”.  “We’re so much alike,” Ghoston said. “We laugh all the time on the phone.”.  Ghoston, of Grenada, Mississippi, said after her father's release, they will take their first-ever photo together..

In mid-November, four black voters and a branch of the NAACP filed a federal lawsuit asking a judge to permanently order Evans and his assistants to stop using peremptory challenges to remove African American residents as potential jurors because of their race..  The lawsuit cites an analysis of jury strikes by Evans from 1992 to 2017 by American Public Media’s “In the Dark” podcast. It found Evans' office used peremptory strikes, which lawyers typically don’t have to explain, to remove 50% of eligible black jurors, but only 11% of eligible white jurors. The analysis was performed as part of a series of episodes questioning Flowers’ conviction in his sixth trial.

1378,"Illinois News Former Illinois City Clerk Convicted of Child Porn A former city clerk in the northern Illinois community of Harvard faces a maximum sentence of five years in state prison after being convicted by a judge of one count of possession of child pornography. By Associated Press , Wire Service Content Dec. 16, 2019 By Associated Press , Wire Service Content Dec. 16, 2019, at 2:00 p.m. More.  A former city clerk in a small northern Illinois community faces a maximum sentence of five years in state prison after being found guilty of one count of possession of child pornography..  Andrew Wells was found guilty of the one count last week by McHenry County Judge Michael Coppedge after a one-week bench trial. Coppedge also found the 57-year-old Wells not guilty on two other child pornography counts..  Wells was the city clerk for Harvard when the discovery of a flash drive containing pornographic images in a desk at an amusement park where he also worked led to his 2016 arrest. He finished his term that ran through 2017 but did not run for re-election..  During the trial, according to the (Crystal Lake) Northwest Herald, no evidence was presented that Wells searched for or downloaded the images of underage girls but Coppedge said he could not understand how Wells could have not noticed the files with obvious pornographic names..  “How is it possible the defendant would not have explored what materials were being added to the USB? ,” the judge asked before finding Wells guilty of the single count of possession of child pornography. Wells is scheduled to return to court for sentencing Jan. 24 on the felony count. The judge can impose a sentence ranging from probation to five years in prison..  Wells does not have a listed telephone number and could not be reached for comment..  Copyright 2019 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.

1380,"by Meg White December 16, 2019.  Last year wasn’t a particularly good one for net population growth in Illinois. In 2018, the state ranked third in terms of states that lost most residents to other states, according to findings compiled from Census data and moving information from United Van Lines by STORAGECafé, a blog run by real estate software company Yardi..  Looking at it on a day-by-day basis, 836 people per day left Illinois last year, while only 566 came in. The most popular destination for those leaving the state was Indiana. In terms of those coming here, California accounted for 8 percent of our total number of new residents..  Those moving from California to Illinois will have to save more than some other relocators, as that route was determined to be one of the most expensive in the country. While the average cost of interstate moves varies between $2,400 and $4,500, depending on the distance, STORAGECafé found that moves from California to Illinois averaged much higher, between $3,600 and $3,700..  Of course, the actual percentage of people who move state-to-state is pretty small — just 9.8 of Americans. And the number has been shrinking; it is now down to the lowest share in recorded history. It’s the first time this figure has dropped below 10 percent since the Census Bureau started gathering this data back in 1947.","[0.8381009101867676, 0.161899134516716]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.8381009101867676

Pritzker encourages local enforcement.  In his daily COVID-19 briefing Sunday in Chicago, Pritzker encouraged local police to help enforce the statewide stay-at-home order amid reports of large parties in Chicago and Peoria..  Pritzker called upon police departments across the state to break up parties and large gatherings..  “We need local government and local police to make sure that people are following these rules,” Pritzker said, adding that “we need the public to comply with the stay-at-home rule because that is how we’ve been defeating coronavirus.”.  “We’re not looking to have police crack down on people, arrest people, that is not the intent here,” the governor said. “But it is true that police can break up a party and should.”.  Pritzker also added that “we’ll provide State Police (as) backup whenever they need it.”.  The governor acknowledged later in the briefing that enforcement abilities become trickier when groups of people number in the thousands..  “I certainly don’t want to put anybody in danger by suggesting that law enforcement needs to go break up a group of 3,000,” Pritzker said. “On the other hand, it is against the order and law enforcement does have that ability.”.  He also warned of the possible danger that such a large gathering could have on public health..  “One person in the middle of that 3,000 can cause many others to get infected and each one of those people has the ability to infect others,” he said..  “People should follow the rules here, and in relatively short order we’ll begin to see, as the economy opens up, things will get better for everyone.” Future federal funding.  President Donald Trump has hinted that future coronavirus aid to states could hinge on states’ actions regarding other matters, such as cracking down on sanctuary cities..  “I don’t know whether there will be strings attached,” Pritzker said Sunday morning in an appearance on CBS’s “Face The Nation.” “I hope there aren’t too many because the fact is every state has a problem and it’s different in every state where they need to put the dollars. So putting more strings on it makes it much more difficult for us to move forward to get our economies going.” Pritzker: COVID-19 scam artists will be caught, prosecuted.  Illinois Senate President Don Harmon, a Democrat from Oak Park, asked the state’s federal lawmakers in April to consider giving more than $41 billion in funding to the state as part of the next coronavirus relief package, including $10 billion to stabilize Illinois’ underfunded pension system..  Pritzker said in his Sunday briefing that he is leaving negotiations on future aid up to Illinois’ federal representatives, but he added that “we should try to leave politics out of this and instead look at what the damage is that’s been done to all the states – those who are represented by Republicans, those who are represented by Democrats – and try to help them, all of us, fill the hole that's been made by coronavirus.”.  Also on the topic of federal funding, Pritzker on Sunday reminded Illinoisans to fill out the U.S. Census forms that arrived in their mailboxes in April. According to the latest data from the Census Bureau, 61.6 percent of Illinoisans have responded to this year’s census..  “I want to encourage everyone to do their part in ensuring you and all Illinoisans get your fair share of federal funding and are fully represented,” Pritzker said, stressing that federal dollars given to states are often based on population counts..

1383,"8 hours ago sinko swimo : There are 45,624 citizens in that county and the church has a roughly 80 person congregation. How poor a church leader do you have to be to have such an incredibly disinterested public? Shot in the dark this is another old timer that should have retired 30 years ago but is too full of himself to give the house of worship new leadership that will bring in new blood. That's a shame. Back when I was not laid off my job, I used to drive through Stephenson County on my way from Rockford to Freeport (Which is the biggest city in Stephenson County) once a week. Stephenson County in Illinois is mostly farm land with little towns scattered across the land. Lena, Il. where this church is located, is the 2nd biggest city in the county, with the city occupying approximately 2 square miles of land. At the 2000 census , [10] there were 2,887 people, 1,164 households and 807 families residing in the village, Per Wiki. The church in question is very small, and per a Google search looks to be part of a house.My Mom grew up in Freeport, and on our last visit out there (to see the changes in the town and visit the cemetary) she commented on how 'big' the town had gotten, with the population of 26,000 as of 2010, its easily 3x bigger than what she remembers. The church she attended, which is still one of the larger congregations in Freeport, only has +/- 300 members. So 80 members for this little church in a town of under 3,000 people is pretty good.I'm not saying that the church in Lena is right or wrong with what they are doing, but 80 people scattered across 2 or 3 services, all of the people taking proper precautions, social distancing IS possible.And yes I know, not everyone will be taking proper precautions.And one last piece of trivia for you: On August 27, 1858, the second debate between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas took place in Freeport and gave the nation direction in the following years. Although Stephen Douglas won the election and retained his U.S. Senate seat, his reply to a question on slavery alienated the South, which called it the ""Freeport Heresy"", and split the Democratic Party. This enabled Abraham Lincoln to win the Presidency in 1860. (Credit Wiki.)","[0.7758593559265137, 0.22414065897464752]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.7758593559265137

It will determine how federal funding dollars will be allocated to programs such as Medicaid, mental health services, food assistance, and more. 2020 Census results will also determine the number of seats Illinois has in the House of Representatives, and will be used to draw congressional and state legislative districts.","[0.5307269096374512, 0.46927309036254883]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5307269096374512
1389,"Gov. JB Pritzker announced 2,994 new coronavirus cases and 63 new fatalities Sunday. This brings statewide totals to 61,499 known cases and 2,618 fatalities across 97 of the state’s 102 counties. Saturday marks the highest number of tests produced in a single day across Illinois since the beginning of the outbreak with 19,417 total tests. This comes as 4,701 individuals were reported to be in state hospitals with the virus as of midnight. Of those individuals, 1,232 were reported to be in intensive care units and 759 were reported to be on ventilators. Sunday’s briefing was mostly taking questions from the press ranging from what methods local authorities should use when getting involved with large crowds utilizing violence to what travel restrictions are in place when it comes to crossing borders to help ill family members. Prior to taking questions from the press, Pritzker used Sunday’s briefing as an opportunity to remind Illinois residents to fill out the 2020 census and to encourage others to do so as well. “It will take you no more than 10 minutes and it will make a real difference to our recovery from the damage that’s been done to all Illinois residents by this Covid-19 pandemic,” Pritzker said..

1390,"Wednesday, July 29, 2020 The ""Wisdom"" of Chicago Mayor Lightfoot Lori Lightfoot’s election on May 20, 2019 as Mayor of Chicago with 73% of the vote was a breath of fresh air in the troubled city. She ran against corruption, a chronic problem in Chicago and Illinois. She started office with a reform agenda. It was her first run for public office. She had held appointed positions, including President of the Chicago Police Board and Chair of the Police Accountability Task Force. She knew where the problems laid with the Chicago Police Department, a department with a poor image in the minority communities. Mayor Lightfoot has been a major, indecisive disappointment. She’s faced many problems, not of her making. First are the systemic budget problems, especially the near-bankrupt pension system. The hole just gets deeper and deeper. Her approach to the fiscal problems is the usual false panacea of tax increases. Second came the Coronavirus, knocking the economy for a loop. She shut down salons and hair stylists under her stay at home order to fight the virus. Mayor Lightfoot the very next day made a visit to her hair stylist. She justified the double standard by saying “I’m the public face of this city. I’m on national media and I’m out in the public eye.” A poor example for the people for Chicago. Then came the George Floyd killing in Minneapolis and the ensuing riots. The large Columbus statue in Grant Park was vandalized on June 13. Then came the young, woke mob on July 17. They tried to pull the statue down, chanting “Columbus was a murderer! Columbus was a thief!” Chicago police saved the statue with 18 officers injured. As Chicago blew up, White House Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany called Mayor Lightfoot “the derelict mayor of Chicago, recommending the mayor seek federal help in securing the city. The Mayor responded in kind “Hey, Karen, watch your mouth.”“Karen” is hate speech, the new epithet for white women. President Trump offered to help Chicago with its crime problems. She threatened to sue President Trump if he sends federal troops into Chicago, adding “I don’t need leadership lessons from Trump.” How’s that leadership thing working out for Chicago Mayor Lightfoot? She further stated “We’re not going to have tyranny in the City of Chicago.” Blood in the streets is OK. Her statements were echoed by Governor Pritzker: Bringing in feds is “a wrongheaded move on the part of Donald Trump.” Senator Duckworth espoused “The Trump Administration is using this as another opportunity to trample on the First Amendment rights of Americans.” Memo to the Governor and Senator: First Amendment Rights do not include riots, looting, arson and attacking federal facilities. Mayor Lightfoot said in May “What I really want to say to Donald Trump ‘begins with F and it end with you’” Federal officers are in Chicago helping the city address its exploding crime problem. The Mayor Monday co-signed a letter with the mayors of Portland, Seattle, Washington, D.C., Albuquerque, and Kansas City asking Congress to enact a statute preventing the President from sending federal law enforcement officers to cities without the consent of the cities. The mayors, especially of Portland and Settle, remain clueless. She’s worried about a census undercount in Chicago. Her response was to don a lime green cowboy hat, harken back to Batman in Gotham, and dispatched “Census Cowboy” on a horse through Chicago to encourage participation in the census: “Giddy up Chicago. I’m calling on the Census Cowboy to help improve our Census response rates across Chicago. Make the census Cowboy proud by filling out the Census today ….” She added “Let’s do this Chicago. Let’s make the census Cowboy proud.” Send in the Census Cowboy while random shootings are climbing. John Catanzara, Fraternal Order of Police President in Chicago, sent an open letter to President Trump asking for help in Chicago. He called Mayor Lightfoot a “complete failure.” She called him a cartoon character” and a “clown”“seeking relevance.” She called the letter a “craven political move.” Save the Census. Let the shootings go on. Chicago counted 1,901 shooting victims from January 1, 2020 to July11, up 550 from 2019. 17 were fatally shot during the Fourth of July weekend, including a 7-year old girl and a 14-year old boy. 70 were wounded. Three children were killed the preceding week. Memorial Day Weekend witnessed 18 deaths and 45 wounded in one day. The homicide numbers were up to 353 for this period, up 99 from 2019. 32 homicide victims under 18 this year, up from20 last year. 63 were shot with 12 fatalities from July 18-20. An additional 23 were shot, with 4 fatalities on Tuesday, June 21. 15 were shot outside a funeral home in a drive-by shooting. Reasons for the rise in shootings include the rise in gangs and the drug trade. Her solution to the deadly crime wave: She removed two Columbus statues in the dead of Friday night, Saturday morning July 24.

1391,"Our Mission To promote a culture of civility and inclusion, in which Illinois lawyers and judges embody the ideals of the legal profession in service to the administration of justice in our democratic society. Home » Media » News » Illinois Supreme Court Approves New Rule for Eviction Proceedings Illinois Supreme Court Approves New Rule for Eviction Proceedings Posted on by Sloane Oxley-Hase.  Earlier this month, the Illinois Supreme Court announced the approval of Rule 139 regarding the practice and procedure in eviction proceedings. The new rule, which went into effect immediately, requires eviction complaints to include a copy of the written eviction notice or demand and, where applicable, the relevant portions of the lease..  The new rule was initially proposed by the Circuit Court of Cook County Pro Se Advisory Committee to the Supreme Court Commission on Access to Justice. Rule 139 allows the plaintiff to attach an affidavit in place of an eviction notice or demand using a standardized form . It also enables the use of an affidavit if the plaintiff does not have the lease or there is no written lease..  The new rule was developed to reinforce the law, practices, and procedures in eviction courts by requiring the attachment of demands, termination notices, proof of service of the demands and notices, and relevant portions of the leases at the time of filing an eviction complaint..  Self-represented landlords are now required to attach all necessary documents to their filing to establish their right to an eviction. Thereby, self-represented tenants will now have access to the relevant information at the outset of their case so they can better understand the basis for the eviction and be prepared to assert defenses..  “This new rule will help self-represented parties on both sides of eviction cases and also the judges hearing these cases by requiring key information at the outset,” said Chief Justice Anne M. Burke in a press release. A Looming Spike in Evictions.  The loss of income and employment as a result of COVID-19 has the potential to lead to an explosive number of evictions across the U.S. In March, most state or local authorities issued a moratorium on evictions. The federal CARES Act, which was passed in early April, froze evictions for renters in federally subsidized housing. But as the country begins opening up moratoriums are ending..  According to a housing pulse survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly one-quarter of Illinois residents and residents nationally said they missed their last rent or mortgage payment or had little to no confidence they would be able to pay on time next month..  In Illinois, Governor J.B. Pritzker extended a ban on evictions until August 22, 2020. The initial eviction moratorium was issued in March. In June, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot signed the COVID-19 Eviction Protection Ordinance, which extends the period that the tenant has to respond to a landlord’s eviction notice from five to 12 days. To qualify, the tenant must write to the landlord during this period stating that they have suffered a “COVID-19 Impact.”.

1393,"Viewpoint: More Illinois basin contraction expected 26 Dec 2019 16:34 GMT Viewpoint: More Illinois basin contraction expected Houston, Illinois basin coal mine closures are likely to continue in 2020 as producers adjust to recent demand cuts..  Producers in the region already have removed more than 10mn short tons/yr (9.1mn metric tonnes/yr) of capacity through a series of mine closings this year..  Most of the cuts became effective late in the year. Production for the first three quarters of 2019 totaled 78.6mn st, just 1.1mn st below 2018 levels, according to US Mine Safety and Health Administration data. After incorporating estimates from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) for October through mid-December, the basin is on track to have just over 100mn st of output this year compared with 106.8mn st in 2018..  The mine closings announced in the second half of the year have the potential to bring Illinois basin production below 100mn st in 2020. But those cuts are not enough to account for recent drops in both international and domestic demand..  One producer said another 7mn-10mn st of output could be taken off line in 2020 and that cuts should focus on mines that primarily target export markets..  Bituminous thermal coal exports out of New Orleans — the primary exit-point for Illinois basin coal – totaled 8.9mn st from January-October, down from 16.2mn st a year earlier, US Census Bureau data show. This includes exports from other basins..  Mines in Illinois, Indiana and western Kentucky – the Illinois basin footprint – exported 17.6mn st in all of 2018, according to EIA data..  Market conditions remain less hospitable for Illinois basin exports than they had been in 2018. Prompt two-month shipments of 11,300 Btu/lb typical 3pc sulfur coal fell to $37.50/t fob New Orleans in the week ended on 20 December and averaged $43.24/t in 2019, compared with an average of $62.91/t in 2018. Illinois basin producers typically need seaborne prices to be closer to $50/t to make a profit shipping to international customers..  Any further mine closures would bring production closer to domestic demand. Basin mines delivered 56.6mn st of coal to utility-scale power plants in the US in the first nine months of this year, EIA fuel receipts data show. Mines shipped 84.8mn st to US customers in 2018, down from 88mn st in 2017..  Of the three states in the basin, Illinois is the largest producer, but could be sheltered from the cuts, Illinois Coal Association president Phil Gonet said..  The state produced 49.5mn st in 2018 and exported 12.5mn st..  Gonet said 56pc of production in Illinois is at longwall mines, which ""will probably be the last to shut down because they are the lowest cost and most productive."".  That could push more of the cuts to mines in Indiana and Kentucky. Recent closures reflect that..  So far this year, only two Illinois mine closings have been announced. Peabody Energy closed the Wildcat Hills-Cottage Grove pit early in the year and plans to close its other Wildcat Hills mine by the end of this month. Those two mines produced 1.7mn st in 2018, MSHA data show..  Peabody also closed the Somerville mine in Indiana in October. That operation, and White Stallion's Liberty mine in Indiana, which was shut in April, produced 3.8mn st of coal in 2018..  Elsewhere in Indiana, Alliance Resource Partners will close its Gibson North mine in January..  Producers have shut down 4.9mn st of production in Kentucky so far this year, including Alliance's Dotiki mine in August, Rhino Resource Partner's Riveredge mine in September and Murray Energy's Paradise No. 9 mine in February..  Murray today said it was shutting its Genesis mine in Kentucky by early March. The mine produced 2.4mn st of coal in 2018, MSHA data shows..  Producers also have seen their US customer bases shrink in recent years, as coal plants across the country have shut in the face of increased competition from natural gas and renewables..  About 17GW of coal-fired generation has retired, or was scheduled to be retired, in the US this year, according to Argus data. The largest retirements included FirstEnergy's 2.7GW Bruce Mansfield power plant in Pennsylvania and Salt River Project's 2.3GW Navajo generating station in Arizona..  That contraction is certain to continue. Another 7GW of coal-fired generation is expected to shut in 2020, including Tennessee Valley Authority's 1.2GW Paradise plant in Kentucky..  Cuts in coal production will be driven by ""utilities switching to natural gas, where we expect prices will remain low, and renewable energy, which still benefit from government subsidies,"" Moody's senior credit officer Benjamin Nelson said..  Analysts at international think-tank the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which typically supports the advancement of renewable generation, expect in the next 20 years that ""virtually all of the US coal-fired plants that currently buy the (Illinois basin's) coal will be either retired or little used.""

Add to that, we’re this close to starting a new decade that is synonymous with perfect vision, which makes us want to take a look back at where we’ve been and how far we’ve come. Yes, we may have lost population numbers for the fourth year in a row, but on the flip side our tourism figures reflected a high of nearly 58 million for 2018. We like the glass “half full” theory (which works to our benefit because Chicago does rank in the top 50 cities when it comes to best cities for beer drinkers — No. 33!).

Advertisement According to Evite, the digital party invite platform, Chicago is the nation’s No. 2 party city of 2019. According to Conde Nast Traveler , The Langham Chicago , at 330 N. Wabash Ave., is the only Midwest address on the list to place on the 2020 Gold List, the magazine’s roster of the best hotels and resorts on the planet. The 2019 Readers’ Choice Awards that were rolled out in October dubbed Chicago the best big city in the country for the third year in a row. And in case you need further proof of how strong Chicago’s hotel game is: U.S. News & World Report’s annual rankings of the best hotels showcased two Chicago properties in the top five — The Peninsula Chicago came in at No. 2 and the city’s Four Seasons Hotel placed fifth in the nation. And not to be outdone by hotels, our region’s B&Bs rank too. The best B&B in the country — and the second best in the world — is Jail Hill Inn in Galena. The site nabbed top U.S. honors in the bed-and-breakfast/inn category in this year’s TripAdvisor Travelers’ Choice hotel awards, according to the travel website TripAdvisor . Our city ranks as the No. 1 metropolis for staycations , according to HotelTonight , the last-minute hotel booking app. This summer, Chicago’s architecture river cruise ranked as one of the world’s best travel experiences, per TripAdvisor’s recently rolled out Travelers’ Choice awards . And the Second City is also home to one of the world’s best hotel bars — so says Forbes Travel Guide. The sixth-floor lounge that is Peninsula Chicago’s Z Bar got what amounts to an A-plus from the guide this fall.

1395,"Chicago vendors help with census outreach among the homeless Updated 8:39 am EDT, Saturday, May 23, 2020.  CHICAGO (AP) — A service organization is partnering with magazine street vendors in Chicago to help collect data on the city's homeless population after the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the U.S. Census Bureau’s original timeline for the decennial count..  Vendors at StreetWise magazine have passed out branded items about the census to people since March, the Chicago Tribune reported. The vendors will be paid by the YWCA Metropolitan Chicago, which is one of the organizations getting state money to communities that risk being undercounted..  Keith Hardiman, a 58-year-old vendor who currently pays $35 per day to live in a hotel, noted that he already has places in mind where he could stop to talk to people about the census that are along his route coming home from downtown..  “I see the lines where they are passing out food,” Hardiman said. “That would be a great place to stop and talk to people and let them (know) about what the census is all about.”.  Before the coronavirus outbreak, the Census Bureau had expected to finish gathering data on the country’s population by July 31 but has since pushed the date back to Oct. 31..  The agency had planned to work with local service organizations to count the homeless during a three-day operation in Chicago. But it’s now unclear when that might occur..  Ellisa Johnson, the deputy director for the Chicago regional census bureau, said the office hired staffers but is in a “holding pattern” until the agency allows them to proceed..  “We are paying very close attention to any state regulations that all the governors have put in place,” Johnson said. “First and foremost, we are making sure that we are following the CDC guidelines.”.  A. Allen, 52, who sold StreetWise for the past nine years, has also pivoted to census outreach. He said census information from previous decennial counts helped him discover that one of his relatives was the first black man to own a car in his Mississippi town..  “We don’t want to lose any more representation for the black community,” Allen said. “We need all the support that we can get, and this is one way.” Most Popular ","[0.5117361545562744, 0.48826390504837036]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5117361545562744
1396,"Reprints Print.  More so than most years, 2020 augurs to be especially important to a city and state that are struggling to escape the economic and political doldrums. Here are some things to watch, guideposts to indicate whether we're truly headed in a new and better direction or remain in stasis (or worse)..  At the top of my list are three big projects that definitely will move the economic needle if they come about and which—fingers crossed—seem well positioned. More Chicago's economy: A look ahead.  The first is the promised full opening of the big Rivian electric truck factory in the old Mitsubishi plant in downstate Normal—the one that just attracted an eye-popping $1.3 billion in private investment capital. Imagine: 1,000 or more well-paying industrial jobs in a sector that's actually expanding fast and which could spur all sorts of secondary benefits throughout the state. And all at the cost of just $45 million in potential state Edge payroll tax credits. Eat your heart out, Wisconsin, which offered billions for a Foxconn facility that could turn out to be just a shell of the Rivian prize..  Then there's the promised Discovery Partners Institute in the South Loop, the key to really cementing Chicago's rise as a tech center, and the budding Obama Presidential Center, which could do nearly as much for a big part of the South Side. We'll soon find out whether the University of Illinois really has raised the private capital needed to release $500 million in state funds for the DPI. And we'll find out whether the Obama center will pass required muster with a federal bureaucracy that reports to one Donald Trump. Showtime!.  Speaking of shows, Gov. J.B. Pritzker put on quite a performance in 2019, getting his heart's desire and more out of the General Assembly. But now he's going to have to get 60 percent of voters to approve his graduated income tax amendment in the November general election. In roughly the same time frame, he'll have to show his cards as to whether he's a reformer or a faker on truly opening up the coming remap of legislative and congressional districts. The jury is out on both, but they will be at the center of this governor's legacy..  The jury also is out on Mayor Lori Lightfoot's plans to stabilize city finances. On the plus side, she got her first budget OK'd by aldermen, and insiders say she's finally going to get approval of a revamped Chicago casino and the hundreds of millions of dollars a year it would provide to pay pension debt. But much of that casino cash will be needed to replace one-time revenues Lightfoot balanced her last budget with. Beyond that, she's yet to cut a deal with affordable housing advocates to split the take from a higher real estate transfer tax. The real question: Can Lightfoot continue to avoid a big, damaging property tax hike?.  Lightfoot also will be the lady in the bucket in selecting a new Chicago police chief to succeed the fired Eddie Johnson. After the post-Laquan McDonald explosion in the city's gun violence and murder rate, the crime statistics finally are coming back to earth. But they're still way, way, way too high compared to peer cities such as New York and Los Angeles. This challenge is too important to mess up..  Also too important to mess up is the upcoming official population count in the 2020 census. For a change, the city and state actually seem to be taking this issue seriously, given the huge amounts of federal aid and political influence that are at stake. The numbers aren't going to be good. But if our leaders do their jobs, they won't be abysmal, either..  Finally, though it's slipped out of the headlines during the holiday season, more is coming in the federal probe of Ed Burke, Mike Madigan, Commonwealth Edison, et al. I suspect there's enough shoes to yet fall out of the federal closet on this one that Imelda Marcos would blush.

1400,"Affluent Chicago suburb aiming for police diversity Published 1:05 am EDT, Saturday, August 22, 2020.  NAPERVILLE, Ill. (AP) — At a time when police across the country are under increased scrutiny, Naperville has an officer applicant pool of 860 candidates -- thanks in part to a new recruitment campaign and the waiving of a $45 applicant fee..  Now, instead of an average of 270 candidates during the past four hiring cycles, Deputy Chief Jason Arres said, the pool has grown in a way that activists hope will help the overwhelmingly white department make progress toward one of its long-standing goals: better mirroring local demographics..  Naperville’s population is 68% white, 18% Asian, 6% Hispanic, 5% Black and 3% other, according to 2019 U.S. Census Bureau estimates. The police department -- with 172 sworn officers -- is 89% white, 2% Asian, 2% Black, 5% Hispanic and 2% other as of 2019. The department has 21 female officers, making up 12% of the force; 19 of them are white, none are Hispanic or Black and two fall into other racial categories..  “One of the biggest things we continue to try to work toward every year is having our department reflect our community,” Arres said. “I think it’s important at any time -- whether we’re in a controversial time for policing or a normal time for policing -- our department should match our community.”.  No matter a candidate’s demographic background, applying to be a police officer in Naperville is a job for the patient and the dedicated. It requires prerequisites of a bachelor’s degree in any field and a Police Officer Wellness Evaluation Report from the state..  The recruitment and hiring process, after meeting these prerequisites, involves at least nine steps, including five instances of review by the city’s board of fire and police commissioners. The police department itself doesn’t make any decisions on who to hire, Arres said. That responsibility falls to the board..  But department leaders set the tone of the process, which they take seriously as a means to hiring an employee who’s likely to be around for 30 to 35 years as part of the public face of city government..  “What you see is a very in-depth process as it goes to hiring someone,” Arres said. “Our police and fire board is very strict, which I like.”.  Even as the department looks to diversify, there are no “bonus points” for being a diverse candidate; decisions hinge on merit alone, as judged by factors including interviews, background screens, reference checks, a polygraph test, a psychological test and a medical exam..  That’s how it should be, said Benny White, Naperville’s first Black city council member and a former member of the board of fire and police commissioners..  “I’m not saying hire folks because of what they look like, but I want to get more people in the pool so there’s more opportunities for them to get hired,” White said. “Then, they’ve got to make it work on their own.”.  Members of the city’s South Asian, Indian and Islamic communities appreciate the steps the police department has taken to reach out and invite their constituents to apply to become officers. Outreach with the Islamic Center of Naperville, for example, results in mosque members inviting officers to attend religious events “so they can come see the culture,” Ashfaq Syed said..  The outreach “has to happen from both sides to fill that gap” in Asian officers relative to the city’s large Asian population, Shafeek Abubaker said. Some of the work is about teaching the realities of policing and countering perceptions that it’s a low-paid job or not as prestigious as, say, being a doctor, engineer or lawyer..  “Sometimes it is a false understanding,” Abubaker said..  But Arres said those thoughts are common among many communities, regardless of their race..  “We get a lot of families worried because policing, even in Naperville, is a dangerous job,” he said. “And that can’t be taken for granted.”.  With a candidate pool of 860 officer-hopefuls in hand, the vetting and testing company IO Solutions now can offer a written exam and create an initial eligibility list, which will be valid for two years. From that list, the police department will call the first candidate available whenever a vacancy arises and begin the rest of the hiring process..  A background investigator checks their criminal, credit, employment, education and family history. An interview with three police leaders puts them through situational questions to prove they can handle the stress and trauma of the job. A psychological test ensures they are mentally fit for duty and are not at high risk of behaviors that would be a liability to the police department. A medical exam clears their heart and physical fitness for the job..  The length of the process and thoroughness of the steps gives a feeling, White said, that “we’re hiring the best of the best.”.  ___.

1403,"By Editor | August 22, 2020 | 0.  Illinois has strong response rate compared to national average, plenty of room to improve.  By RAYMON TRONCOSO — The Illinois Department of Human Services said the state is poised to have one of the top census response rates in the country despite two tumultuous months of changing deadlines as determined by the Trump Administration..  Illinois sits at a 69.1 percent self-response rate as of Thursday, up two points from its 67 percent self-response rate on July 19. The national response rate was 64.2 percent..  The state’s 2010 census response rate was 70.5 percent, giving organizers hope of passing that mark by the Sept. 30 deadline – a date recently moved forward one month by the Trump administration..  Illinois currently has the seventh-highest self-response rate of any state in the U.S. and is the only state in the top 10 that has a population exceeding 10 million. Chicago also has the highest response rate for any city with a population over 2 million, according to the Illinois 2020 Census Office..  Maximizing the census count is important, because the population count helps determine federal funding and the number of representatives the state sends to the U.S. House..  The positive trend comes despite challenges posed by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and changing federal deadlines..  The Illinois 2020 Census Advisory Panel discussed obstacles to self-reporting and shifting standards from the federal government at a regularly scheduled meeting Friday..  “This past month, as you all know, has been a month of many surprises for us at the census office,” Oswaldo Alvarez, co-director of the Illinois Census Office at the IDHS, said..  There were several contributing factors that led the office to reorder its timeline, including delays in in-person door-knocking and the Trump Administration’s Aug. 13 announcement that the census portal would close Sept. 30 instead of Oct. 31..  “So at this point we are operating at the census office as if (Sept. 30) is the official deadline and that’s it, until we are informed otherwise,” Alvarez said. “Because of that, there has been a lot of shifting that we have been doing at the census office.”.  Additionally, a July 21 presidential memorandum seeking to exclude illegal immigrants from being counted as it pertains to Congressional apportionment also created confusion at IDHS. That memorandum has since been challenged in court, but, if implemented, would cost Illinois up to two seats in the House..  For the 2020 fiscal year, IDHS was funding more than 360 non-profits and municipal governments for the purpose of increasing census self-response rates. But that number has dwindled to a little more than 250 for fiscal year 2021 due to the pandemic, shifting deadlines and other circumstances..  Funds to those nonprofits are disbursed through 30 other non-profit organizations that serve as regional intermediaries, or RIs, which oversee 12 regions of the state and lead hyperlocal outreach efforts..  Intermediaries include health-based agencies such as the Illinois Primary Health Care Association, community outreach groups such as Teens Against Killing Everywhere, and other organizations such as the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus..  IDHS was allocated $29 million for the 2020 fiscal year to be used for census outreach, including nearly $26 million set aside for regional intermediaries..  State agencies assisting in census outreach were allocated $2.3 million, while approximately $900,000 went to the University of Illinois at Chicago for technical assistance and data analysis..  Due to the coronavirus pandemic, not all the funds were spent before the end of the fiscal year on June 30, so they were reappropriated for the current fiscal year. As of Friday, a little over $4.4 million remains unspent..  “We were nervous that it would be a lot more remaining than 4.4 (million),” Marishonta Wilkerson, also co-director of the Illinois Census Office, said at the meeting. “We thought it would be like 10 (million). But the RI’s were creative, and they found different ways to engage their communities virtually and we are happy about that.”.  Still, some areas of the state remain below their self-response target rates. As part of its August report, IDHS said many counties had self-response rates below 50 percent. As of July 29, Hardin, Calhoun, Henderson and Alexander Counties had the lowest response rates, with Hardin County in particular sitting at 31.9 percent, 10 percentage points fewer than the next lowest county..  “The governor’s office has asked us to do a final and bigger push in certain areas of population, so we are having our RI’s gear up and do a big push,” Wilkerson said. “Additional canvassing, door-knocking in rural areas and in particularly the African American, Latinx and Asian areas.”.

1404,"With September 30 deadline approaching nearly 184,400 households in Black wards have not submitted responses.  By Erick Johnson.  Nearly 184,000 households in Chicago’s predominately Black wards have not responded to the 2020 Census with a little more than a month remaining before the September 30 deadline, according to data from the city’s ward reports..  Among Chicago’s three biggest racial groups, the city’s 18 predominately Black wards have the lowest response rate with 52.33 percent of 386,861 households submitting their 2020 Census count. Some 184,399 households in Black wards have yet to submit their census response..  Chicago’s 14 Hispanic wards had an overall 53.09 percent response rate, but 120,644 households have not responded to the 2020 Census..  White wards have the highest response rate of three racial groups. The overall response rates in Chicago’s 18 predominately white wards is 63.45 percent, but 193,010 households have yet to submit their 2020 Census form..  Of the 1,172,202 households in all of Chicago’s 50 wards, 57.51 percent have responded to the 2020 Census, but 498,053 households have not..  Among the Black wards, the 18th ward has the highest response rate with 68.8 percent. Of the 18 Black wards, 10 have a response rate of over 50 percent and two have a response rate of over 60 percent..  With nearly a month before the deadline, eight predominately Black wards have response rates below 50 percent. The 24th Ward has the lowest response rate with 41.1 percent of 15,830 households submitting their 2020 Census..  Among the 14 Hispanic wards, 11 have response rates over 50 percent and two have response rates over 60 percent. Three Hispanic wards have response rates lower than 50 percent..  Nationwide, more than 93 million households have responded to the 2020 Census. Last week, the U.S. Census Bureau began following up with households nationwide that have not yet responded to the 2020 Census. Based on the current self-response rate of 63.3 percent, the Census Bureau estimates it will need to visit about 56 million addresses to collect responses in person. Up to 500,000 census takers across the country will go door to door to assist people in responding to the 2020 Census..  By comparison, all 18 of Chicago’s predominately white wards have response rates over 50 percent. Fourteen have response rates over 60 percent and three wards have response rates of over 70 percent..  The census helps to shape decisions about how federal funds are disbursed to communities for housing, healthcare, roads, schools, hospitals, emergency services and other programs..  More specifically, the federal government’s distribution of more than $675 million annually to communities is determined by the number of residents counted through the census. Thus, an accurate census count is extremely important for the best financial distribution to local government..  In December, the Census Bureau will deliver the apportionment count to the President and Congress as required by law. By March 31, the Census Bureau sent redistricting counts to the states. This information is used to redraw legislative districts based on population changes..  Black leaders across the country have expressed concern that minorities in hard-to-count areas will be left out and not represented in the final census count..  Residents will have three ways they can respond to the 2020 Census—online, by mail or by phone..  To respond online, go to my2020- Census.gov..  To respond by phone call 1-844-330-2020..

1406,"Chicago’s Gage Park neighborhood sits in two ZIP codes that have seen some of the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the city..  The community is located on Chicago’s Southwest Side, where the Hispanic Latino population has skyrocketed over the past few decades..  Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors According to city and census data in 1990, Gage Park was 40% Hispanic Latino. Now, it's 92%. And many of the neighborhood’s residents are immigrants..  At the Frida Kahlo Community Organization, Natividad Hernandez is devoted to working with immigrants – those here legally and undocumented alike – to access benefits..  But she says that’s been difficult throughout the pandemic..  “In the pandemic everything has changed,” she said. “Nothing is the same. And now, because immigration has been working very slow, people (are) just getting afraid of losing benefits.”.  Hernandez says one of the reasons there are so many COVID-19 cases in the area is because of a lack of information – something she’s working to change..  She tells clients they can get tested for the coronavirus for free, and they don’t need to worry about their names or information being shared with immigration enforcement..  Video: Our full interview with Antonio Santos, of the Gage Park Latinx Council..  Leaders of the Southwest Collective say another reason for the large case count is that many residents live in multi-family units, and it’s hard to stay socially-distant when generations, or neighbors, share a kitchen or laundry space..  The Southwest Collective is a nonprofit that formed last year that promotes and helps businesses in all of the neighborhoods surrounding Midway Airport..  Founder Jaime Groth Searle says it’s always been hard for businesses to compete against giants like Amazon..  But a new issue has popped up. She says bars, salons and stores are having a hard time enforcing COVID-19 guidelines with wary customers..  “They don’t want to turn away business, so they’re caught in this Catch-22 of like, I’ve tried to enforce it, you need to wear a mask,” Searle said. “And folks really get mad, and they walk out … and when you’re small and local …you can’t afford an angry review on Yelp, or you can’t afford someone to walk out who is a regular.”.  She says the collective is working to advise businesses on what they can do if they do get a bad online review, and how they can post helpful signs..  Another small business in the neighborhood is Grecia’s Bakery on 51st Street, where nearly everything is made from scratch using owner Maria Ortega’s father's recipes..  Like many Mexican bakeries, Grecia's is self-serve. Ortega says they’ve always sterilized the tongs and trays after each use..  Despite the coronavirus, she wants to keep that up to preserve authenticity. But now customers are asked to social distance, and to wear disposable gloves and to use hand sanitizer..  Ortega says despite the increased costs, she’s made a point of keeping prices low because she knows some of her customers can’t afford to pay more..  “We have a lot of customers that come on a daily basis, established clientele with them. They come to us with their family problems, right now the unemployment … and we’re with them, we understand that,” Ortega said..  Ortega says the bakery’s business actually increased at the start of the pandemic. She used Facebook and Instagram to get the community’s attention. But business has now begun to slow..  Video: Our full interview with Chicago Lithuanian Center Chairman Antanas Rasymas..  One group that’s been organizing pandemic relief efforts in the neighborhood is the Gage Park Latinx Council, formed in 2018..  Director and cofounder Antonio Santos says neighborhood residents have been struggling to pay rent and put food on the table, and his group hopes to ease some of the burden — including for undocumented people..  “We’ve organized a mutual aid effort for undocumented families,” he said. “Despite paying taxes, undocumented folks are not eligible for any kind of federal assistance, so that includes food stamps and unemployment, things like that.”.  Another staple in Gage Park is the Chicago Lithuanian Center..  The Center runs a school on Saturday mornings for kids and teenagers, teaching them Lithuanian culture and customs..  Their major revenue comes from renting out their various spaces and halls, which has dried up since the center closed in March..  But the organization’s chairman Antanas Rasymas is optimistic the center will make it through, and continue serving as a home for the region’s large Lithuanian diaspora..  “[We’re] very headstrong on keeping the center open and alive, for future generations,” he said.","[0.501205325126648, 0.49879467487335205]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.501205325126648
1407,"With census response rates in Henning and Rankin at a critical low, State Senator Scott Bennett (D-Champaign) is urging residents in these areas to complete the 2020 Census to ensure their communities aren’t left out of the final count..  “In order to get an accurate count, every resident in our community must respond to the Census,” Bennett said. “For every person we miss, we risk losing out on federal funding for our schools, hospitals and highway construction.”.  Across Vermilion County, participation in the 2020 Census is lower than in the 2010 Census. Only 59.3% of Danville residents have completed their census forms this year, as opposed to 68.7% of residents in 2010. In Henning and Rankin, just 54.1% of residents have been counted—a decade ago, 71% of Henning residents and 63.2% of Rankin residents responded..  Residents can complete the census for their household at www.my2020census.gov. Higher self-response rates mean fewer individuals are likely to receive visits from census surveyors to be counted in person. This year, census surveyors are putting their and their families’ health at risk of COVID-19, and limiting visits may mean saving lives..  “We only get this opportunity once every 10 years,” Bennett said. “Help our community by taking a few minutes to make sure you are counted.”.

1408,"Roodhouse was ranked the poorest town in Illinois in a 24/7 Wall St. analysis examining small, lower-income communities where households earn much less than the nation’s median annual household income..  With a population of 1,792, Roodhouse recorded a median home value of $47,600, based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2018 American Community Survey..  Roodhouse’s poverty rate was pegged at 22.3 percent, and its median annual household income came in at $32,335..  A lower level of education is one characteristic that residents of the poorest towns have in common, according to the analysis. The share of adults with four-year degrees averages less than 20 percent in most of the towns in the ranking, the study concluded, while nationwide the percentage with bachelor’s degrees is 31.5 percent..

1409,"Can parents leave children home alone for remote learning in Illinois? Springfield, IL, USA / News/Talk 94.7 & 970 WMAY Aug 21, 2020 10:41 PM AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh).  (The Center Square) – More than 430,000 Illinois households with children under 14 may not have a parent who could stay home to supervise their online learning..  For parents who decide their pre-teen is responsible enough to stay home alone and learn, a murky state statute could get create confusion..  More Illinois school districts are opting to start the school year with only remote learning, sometimes with little notice, because of concerns about COVID-19 outbreaks, leaving working parents to either reduce hours or quit jobs or find another place their kids can go during the school day. The latter option can cost parents thousands of dollars..  Consumer advocates at Smart Dollar used 2018 Census data to tabulate what percentage of single-family households with kids under 14 years of age had full-time working parents..  Illinois matched national figures, showing 41 percent of the state’s more than 1 million single-family households didn’t have a parent who didn’t work full time..  Those thousands of parents who might think their young student is responsible enough to be home alone during the workday may be right, but the Department of Children and Family Services deems a neglected minor as “any minor under the age of 14 years whose parent or other person responsible for the minor’s welfare leaves the minor without supervision for an unreasonable period of time without regard for the mental or physical health, safety or welfare of that minor.”.  The state statute says “for more than a period of 24 hours,” but an incident could remain on a parent’s record for years. In other states, school officials have reported dozens of families to state social workers after the children fail to log on for virtual classes..  Illinois' law has a higher age than other states, partly because of a high-profile case in 1992. In that case, David and Sharon Schoo, in 1992 left their 9- and 4- year-old daughters alone in their home near St. Charles over Christmas while they vacationed in Mexico. The movie “Home Alone 2” was in theaters at the time and the story generated national headlines. A judge later sentenced the parents to two years of probation as part of a plea deal..  Efforts to change the law in recent years have stalled, but state Rep. Joe Sosnowski, R-Rockford, plans to take another run at putting the age in the state law in line with other states..  “There’s inconsistent language and, according to our statutes, anybody under the age of 14 really needs to have an adult or supervision,” he said. “When we’re talking about virtual school and not having five days of school, it’s especially pertinent that the Legislature make sure that the laws that we have are consistent and allow parents that flexibility for those kids who are obviously mature enough to stay home.”.  Kyle Hillman, director of legislative affairs at the National Association of Social Workers, Illinois Chapter, said it is legal to leave a minor home alone during the workday because of the phrase “for an unreasonable period of time” in the state law..  “Under Illinois law, that is perfectly legal to leave that child home alone as long as it’s a reasonable amount of time and you took care of their health and wellbeing,” he said..  Hillman said he opposed Sosnowski’s bill. He said the bill removes a weapon in a prosecutor’s arsenal to properly punish negligent parents. A better solution, he said, would be for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to clarify what is safe and what isn’t safe..  “A parent wants to know ‘as long as I leave my 12-year-old to do homeschool and I’ve taken care of all of these different things, I’m gonna be in the clear?’” he said. “That’s where I don’t think it needs a statutory change, I think it needs a DCFS advisory change.”.

When asked about his view of the legislation in light of widespread virtual learning, his office responded..

In the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Chicago Football Classic (CFC) and its partner, Sherman Dodge, continue to offer support to underserved communities and college-bound students. On Thursday, August 20, CFC founders Larry Huggins and Everett Rand joined Sherman Dodge owner Dave Dickens to present a brand-new Ford E450 van to Habilitative Systems Inc. (HSI) a human services agency based on the west side of Chicago..  “We are grateful for strong partners like Sherman Dodge who are helping us continue to make an impact in our community without our annual game taking place this fall,” said Chicago Football Classic founder, Larry Huggins. HSI services are critical to the community and we could not think of a more deserving organization to receive this vehicle from Sherman Dodge.”.  HSI aids a variety of individuals in Chicago with developmental disabilities, mental illness, and substance abuse, as well as offers youth and family services. According to Donald Dew, HSI president, and CEO, the van will be used to reach more of Chicago’s underserved communities..  “Having this 16-passenger, fully-accessible vehicle is significant because as we all know the pandemic has created a tremendous amount of isolation, and more so for people with special needs,” Dew said. “ This van will help us increase outreach and services in the community.”.  HSI is also the lead agency for the Counting on Chicago Coalition (COCC) and the largest Illinois census regional intermediary and grant recipient of the state of Illinois. The COCC is comprised of 30 social service agencies from across Chicago. HSI, along with ITS 30 partners, is charged with promoting the census and educating marginalized populations to ensure the hardest-to-reach residents are counted in the 2020 census..  “We know if we’re not fairly counted, we don’t get our fair share of federal resources back into the Chicago area” noted Dew..  In addition to the van donation to HSI, Sherman Dodge donated a Jeep Wrangler to the CFC, which it plans to raffle to help raise funds for the Chicago Football Classic Scholarship Fund. Last week, the CFC awarded $100,000 in scholarships and brand-new laptops for remote learning to 20 deserving African-American high school graduates attending historically Black colleges and universities this fall..  “Over 10 years, Sherman Dodge has contributed over a million dollars to the Chicago Football Classic,” Huggins said. “The only reason we can do what we do is because of our generous sponsors.”.

1421,"Illinois has only 36 available, affordable rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income households; the 2020 census will determine funding for federal programs that alleviate shortage.  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: March 10, 2020 CONTACT: Kristin Ginger, Manager of Communications & Development, Housing Action Illinois, or 312-854-3333.  CHICAGO – A new report released today by the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) and Housing Action Illinois finds a national shortage of nearly seven million affordable and available rental homes for extremely low-income (ELI) renter households. The Gap: A Shortage of Affordable Homes reports on the severe shortage of affordable rental homes available to financially-vulnerable families and individuals. Among the report’s key findings are: There are just 36 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 extremely low-income renter households in Illinois. Extremely low-income renter households are those with incomes at or below the poverty line, or 30% of their area median income. In Illinois, we have 450,590 ELI renter households. 71% of the poorest renter households in our state are severely housing cost-burdened, spending more than half of their income on housing, with little left over for other basic necessities..  “Far too many families in Illinois are spending more than 50 percent of their income on housing, living on the brink,” says Sharon Legenza, Executive Director of Housing Action Illinois. “They’re forced to choose between necessities like medicine and groceries or paying the rent. They’re just one financial setback away from eviction and homelessness.”.  Vital federal programs support these families and address the overall shortage of affordable units by investing in the creation of more affordable housing. The George Washington Institute of Public Policy calculates that in Fiscal Year 2016, Illinois received more than $40 million for the HOME Program and nearly $346 million for the Low Income Housing Tax Credit , both federal programs that support the development of affordable housing. Illinois also received $926 million for the Housing Choice Voucher program, proven to reduce housing instability and homelessness while improving child and adult well-being. With these funds, our state is able to assist tens of thousands of families—the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities finds that vouchers supported 94,500 Illinoisan households in 2018—and many more qualify for the program than it is able to support..  How much funding Illinois receives for these vital housing programs all comes back to one driving factor: census data. This week, the U.S. Census Bureau is mailing out census forms to every household in the country, and the online census form goes live. Required by our constitution and conducted every 10 years, the census is the one chance Illinois gets each decade to make sure our citizens are fully counted and ensure accurate representation in Congress and funding for federal programs that support our communities..  “We need to count every single person in Illinois—and that includes renters, students, babies, non-citizens, people experiencing homelessness, and other populations that are hard to count,” explains Bob Palmer, Housing Action Illinois’s Policy Director. “During the last census, one in every four Illinoisans went uncounted. We can’t afford to let that happen again. For each person who goes uncounted, we leave as much as $1,800 on the table. That’s money we need to build housing, assist low-income renter households, address homelessness, fix roads, put towards health care, and do so much more.”.

1424,"Grace Hauck USA TODAY CHICAGO — Midwestern cities are leading the nation in providing opportunities to immigrant communities, and Chicago's setting the standard, according to a report released Wednesday. New American Economy, a bipartisan research group dedicated to comprehensive immigration reform , released its second-annual Cities Index , which assesses how well the 100 largest cities are supporting immigrants. This year, Chicago ranked number one , followed by Chula Vista, Cali.; Jersey City; and San Francisco. “We are tremendously proud Chicago has been named the most welcoming city in America for immigrants and refugees,” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement. “This ranking reflects the passionate and dedicated work of countless public officials and community members across our city who have come together to stand up and fight for the rights of our immigrant and refugee communities, no matter the cost.” Michael Bloomberg, Rupert Murdoch and other corporate executives launched New American Economy in 2010 as a coalition dedicated to reframing immigration reform as the solution to repairing and stimulating the American economy. The group aims to secure the borders and prevent illegal immigration, create more opportunities for immigrants to join the U.S. workforce and build a path to legal status for all undocumented immigrants. The group's annual index uses 51 factors to determine how well cities are creating environments that help immigrants succeed, including a city's language access policies, employment and homeownership rates and more. Andrew Lim, Director of Quantative Research at New American Economy, said that Chicago came out on top this year because the city has created an inclusive legal environment and has taken up policies supporting undocumented immigrants and DACA recipients. Like other major cities, however, Chicago came up short on providing access to affordable housing and income equality. Immigrants make up more than one-fifth of Chicago's population , according to city estimates. In 2016, immigrants held nearly a quarter of the spending power among the city’s residents, earned nearly $17 billion in household income, and paid $6 billion in taxes in 2016. That year, nearly 20,000 DACA-eligible individuals were living in Chicago. The Windy City has long considered itself a safe haven of immigrant communities. In 2016, then-mayor Rahm Emanuel declared Chicago a sanctuary city, later challenging the Trump administration's attempt to deny sanctuary cities federal funding. In recent years, the city has implemented a new legal protection fund and launched a task force to coordinate policies affecting immigrants and refugees. ""We're glad to see that Chicago is ahead of the curve, which is due in large part to the immigrant community members who have fought hard to make the city more welcoming. Now, with a new mayor, we have a new opportunity to further solidify the progress that cities are making for immigrant communities across the country,"" said Lawrence Benito, Executive Director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. Chicago isn't the only Midwestern city making big strides in developing policies that support immigrants. Cleveland, Milwaukee and Toledo were among the cities whose scores improved the most from last year. ""Midwestern cities are really proactive on this issue,"" Lim said. ""A lot of that has to do with their own economic development plans. A lot of cities in the Midwest have struggled with population loss, so they’re really encouraging people to stay in these cities or to come from afar to help them bounce back."" Medium-to-large-size cities in the South and near the border — such as Chula Vista, located in the San Diego metro area — are also seeing policy improvements as immigrants and non-immigrants alike flock to cheaper housing and job opportunities, Lim said. In smaller cities such as Jacksonville, Fla., Norfolk, Va., and St. Petersburg, Fla., the researchers reported smaller gaps in homeownership rates, health insurance rates and educational attainment rates between immigrants and people born in the U.S. Researchers said many of the top cities had implemented policies aimed at welcoming immigrants. Dozens have an office for immigrant affairs, and more than half run or support entrepreneurship programs that cater to immigrants. Others have issued municipal identification cards to increase immigrants' access to social services, established legal defense funds for immigrants facing deportation, and provided services that guide immigrants through the naturalization process. Lim said the idea of an index first arose out of a desire to create a ""universal yardstick"" that cities could use to understand how their policies compared to those of other cities. ""Often times, the question would come up — how do we compare to other cities? What are our peer cities doing?"" Lim said. ""We created this index to help local actors and policymakers have an idea of where they stand."" Here are the top 24 cities of this year's index: Chicago, IL ","[0.5003517270088196, 0.49964818358421326]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5003517270088196

1428,"Illinois Election 2020: What is at stake for Blacks in Illinois. Shera Strange, Contributing Writer September 17, 2020.  For Blacks living in Illinois, there is much at state in the 2020 election. Illinois ranks as one of the highest in engagement among African Americans and during the midterm election for the State. Illinois voters will cast ballots for the President, Vice President, U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, the Illinois Legislature, and Cook County positions. In addition, local races include; Cook County State’s Attorney, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Board of Commissioners, the Illinois Supreme Court, and the Cook County Board of Review. In 2016, the number of registered voters in Illinois broke a record of 8 million..  Illinois residents that identified as black or African American made up 14.2% of the population (U.S. Census Bureau). While Illinois does not have a more significant percentage of African Americans compared to other states, we are close to the national average and send many African Americans to Congress. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the lack of trust in the US Postal Service, many African Americans are choosing not to mail in their ballots but will cast their votes in the 2020 election in person instead to ensure they are counted. Black Americans across the county share similar concerns even as Illinois allows any voter to request a ballot by mail as a safety precaution during the pandemic..  Illinois Supreme Court.  This election could see more diversity in the State Supreme Court. Currently, the court is at risk of returning to an all-white bench. Once elected, justices serve 10-year terms, and judges do not have term limits..  Illinois Referenda: The “Flat Tax”.  The proposed amendment grants the State to institute higher income tax rates on those with higher income, which is how the federal government and most other states operate. The amendment in this year’s election would remove the portion referred to as the “flat tax,” which now requires all income taxes to be at the same rate. The amendment gives the State the ability to impose higher tax rates on those with higher incomes and lower income tax rates on those with middle or lower incomes..  Health Care.  Last summer, Illinois signed up 646,000 people under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, covering adults below 140 percent of the poverty level. Illinois’s execution of the expansion contained a twist and required the federal government to cover 90 percent of the cost. If Trump reduces the reimbursement rate, coverage for hundreds of thousands of people could stop. Federal payments for those patients have reduced Cook County taxpayers’ subsidy for the health system from $400 million a year to $110 million this year. That reduction was possible for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle to pass a balanced budget. This year’s election could impact hundreds of thousands who require medical coverage..  Licenses for Medical Marijuana Dispensaries.  More than 700 groups submitted 4,000 applications. The State advanced 21 of these groups to the next stage of a lottery to award 75 licenses. Of the 21 applicants, only 13 are owned and controlled by people of color..  Cook County State’s Attorney and The Cook County Board of Review.  Being the second-largest prosecutor’s office in the country, the vision for transforming the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office into a fairer department and rebuilding the public trust, while promoting transparency, while being proactive in making all communities safe; is at stake. Providing accurate and corrected Property tax assessments for owners to ensure a full, fair, and impartial evaluation of the property is at stake..  There is much at stake in the 2020 election; fair representation for health care concerns, property tax assessments, economic opportunity, and justice to name a few.

Presented by the Chicago Headline Club, the nation’s largest chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, the Lisagor Awards recognize exemplary journalism produced in Illinois and Northwest Indiana. “ The Quiet Rooms ,” a collaboration with the Chicago Tribune, won the Watchdog Award, which honors Chicago-area news reporting that calls attention to situations in which the public is being harmed or poorly served. The series also won Lisagor Awards for best multimedia collaboration, best data journalism and best education reporting. The stories by ProPublica Illinois reporter Jodi S. Cohen, the Tribune’s Jennifer Smith Richards and former ProPublica Illinois reporting fellow Lakeidra Chavis showed how Illinois schools frequently put children in stark “isolated timeout” spaces, or physically restrained them, for reasons that violated state law. The day after the first story in the series was published, Illinois’ governor and state education officials committed to sweeping change, beginning with emergency restrictions. State officials banned locked seclusion immediately, put new restrictions on schools’ use of physical restraint and also announced plans to invest $7.5 million over the next three years to train Illinois educators on more positive ways to work with students. “ You’re Destroying Families ” by Melissa Sanchez and Duaa Eldeib, with illustrations by Lydia Fu, won for best non-deadline reporting and best illustration. Co-published with the Chicago Sun-Times, the story reveals the failures of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to serve Spanish-speaking families whose children enter the foster care system. The investigation revealed that the agency’s breakdowns span decades, violating a 1977 federal consent decree. In some cases, lapses caused workers to miss key information in investigations of abuse and neglect, contributing to the injuries and deaths of children in state care. In their reporting, Sanchez and Eldeib also found that the legal aid organization assigned to represent Spanish-speaking, Latino families in Illinois had failed to ensure the state was doing its job. As a result of the investigation, agency officials implemented multiple reforms, including hiring more bilingual staff, recruiting more bilingual foster families and updating internal systems to better track whether children of Spanish-speaking parents were being placed in homes where that language is spoken. In addition, the legal aid organization responsible for monitoring the state’s compliance with the court order went back to federal court for the first time in nearly a decade, and it has now sought records that would allow it to scrutinize the agency’s compliance. “ The Legend of A-N-N-A "" by Logan Jaffe won for best feature story or series. Co-published with The Atlantic, the story uncovered the history of Anna, Illinois, and other nearly all-white “sundown towns” where, historically, black people were not welcome after dark. For the story, Jaffe visited Anna again and again over 18 months, establishing a trust that allowed people to speak candidly and to examine their world with clearer eyes. To ground her reporting in a deep understanding of Anna’s history and context, she also pored through centuries-old census records, listened to oral histories and examined microfilm of long-gone newspapers. The story sparked meaningful conversations in Anna, on community Facebook pages, among residents’ everyday lives and even from the pulpit. A number of the town’s current and former residents wrote to Jaffe to thank her for her nuanced portrait. See a list of all this year’s Peter Lisagor Award winners here .

Food insecurity is on the rise as the country grapples with the sixth month of the pandemic. Thanks to our sponsors:.  Survey data from the Census Bureau shows that 1 in 10 Americans does not have enough food, and that food insufficiency among children has risen over the summer..  Meanwhile, a recent poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that in Chicago, 17% of households say they can’t afford to pay for both their food and bills..  At the Greater Chicago Food Depository , need has increased by 120% since January, according to Nicole Robinson, the vice president of community impact at the organization, which works with more than 700 food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and other programs..  Before COVID-19, food insecurity had been decreasing, said Angela Odoms-Young, an associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago..  “One thing we have not seen change, even over many years, is that gap, that racial and ethnic gap in food insecurity. That’s persisted for many years, and now with COVID it’s just exacerbated,” Odoms-Young said. “We know in communities on the South and West sides we have that historic disadvantage and that history disinvestment. So when you lay a pandemic on top of that, already we have a wealth gap, already we have an investment gap, a resource gap, an opportunities gap, it just becomes wider.”.  Robinson agrees, citing high rates of chronic health conditions, high unemployment rates and life expectancy gaps..  “What we knew about communities on the South and West sides of the city is that there was a silent pandemic happening before COVID-19,” Robinson said. “What this public health crisis did was shine a really big light on it.”.  As the coronavirus pandemic persists, Robinson expects the need to increase..  “The pandemic has tested what we are able to do,” Robinson said. “We’ve really had to ramp up our efforts at the food depository by getting more food, creating new partnerships, because there’s also a gap around trust.”.

1444,"Women’s March Chicago, Women Employed and impact for Black Women Shera Strange, Contributing Writer January 21, 2020.  Following the 2016 election, the Women’s March speared to action. This year’s Women March slogan is “Protect, Connect, and Activate.” Mary Kay Devine, the Senior Director of External Affairs, who oversees the Women March Chicago, says the march focuses on five (5) key issues: Census, Climate Change, Gun Violence Prevention, Health Care Access, and Voting..  Issues including the protection of working women’s rights, connecting women of color to become more involved in the Census, and the necessity of voting was on the forefront of issues at this year’s march. With the help of Women Employed, the 2020 Woman’s March Chicago is hoping to inform and promote changes that will help women, particularly women of color. There is $675 billion distributed to various programs and services using Census data. For each person missed in Chicago, the city could lose $1,400 (per person) and representation in Congress..  Women Employed is a registered 501(c) (3) non-profit organization founded in 1973 in Chicago. They work on the state level and national level, but much of the work is in Chicago. Women Employed is an advocacy organization that does not work directly with companies but instead, helps implement system change, policies, and practices; policies that affect thousands of women to improve their economic status. Laws include pay equity, paid time off, fair workweek/scheduling, paid sick time, sexual harassment, minimum wage, and gender equity. Under new leadership, Women Employed is looking to increase its outreach with more African American women through increased participation in their advocacy programs, and with its involvement in the Women March Chicago 2020..  Cherita Ellens is the newly appointed CEO of Women Employed. Cherita is the first black woman to lead this organization. She says that she is grateful to have this opportunity to be in a leadership role whose advocacy programs affect women and to be a voice for women of color. Her goal is to encourage more women of color to become involved with the advocacy of Women Employed. Over the past few years, more women of color are coming to the forefront of the feminist movement. Cherita understands that there are many reasons why black women shy away from involvement in advocacy programs like Women Employed. Historically women-led organizations are rarely supported and, therefore, less funded. This holds especially true for black women-led organizations..  CEO Cherita Ellens states that black women are the most educated yet most underpaid group. “Black women are especially affected by unfair work practices, wages, sexual harassment, and are at more risk of losing their jobs when it comes to family issues.” Such policies are why more African American women need to be present and involved. “When policies are made, African American women are often absent from the conversation. Cherita’s goal is to bring black women to the table to help change these policies. Cherita states, “Until we have the same voice, we are not moving ahead, and the feminist movement cannot move this advocacy without women of color.” Moving forward and changing the landscape takes groundwork and focus groups of black women from all walks of life to be involved in demanding to be included and counted when it comes to talks about policies in the workforce and corporate practices..  This year’s Women’s March partnered with Women Employed. “We all need to be full participants,” especially with this year’s Census and election. Cherita Ellens says. “This election is as important as 2016”. The Women March Chicago plans to promote full participation in the U.S Census. Cherita states that Black women cannot allow fear to stop them from participating in the Census: “It is up to us to be sure our communities, Black communities, are counted, and it is our responsibility to be heard to move to action.”.  Women Employed is not endorsing a candidate but stressed that everyone should vote. “We must understand what is at stake and be very clear on where the candidates stand on issues and the five key issues.” Women’s March Chicago and the work of Women Employed will continue to advocate for women of all races and backgrounds.

1446,"Getty Images.  Time was, people generally didn’t worry too much about housing affordability in Chicago’s swankiest neighborhoods..  Sure, glitzy Gold Coast penthouses and gracious Lincoln Park townhomes were out of reach for average working stiffs. But middle-class renters and homebuyers could afford homes in many other neighborhoods around town. More Crain's Forum: Chicago's housing jam.  In recent years, however, that’s started to change. Gentrification is driving up housing costs in areas like Logan Square and Pilsen, as developers convert humble two-flats and bungalows into high-end homes of the type you expect to see in Chicago’s most exclusive enclaves..  As moderately priced homes disappear from more neighborhoods, people of modest means have a harder time finding a place to live. A percolating affordability crisis threatens to put Chicago on the path of cities like New York, Boston and San Francisco , where surging housing costs are crushing low-to-middle income families..  Predictably, the emerging shortage of affordable housing has triggered the interventionist impulses of city politicians. Earlier this month, some aldermen called for a 14-month moratorium on new home construction in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods around the 606 trail. Mayor Lori Lightfoot last week agreed to a shorter six-month ban on new demolition permits in the area..  As my colleague Alby Gallun reported in Crain’s this week, the next front appears to revolve around Chicago’s Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO), which requires developers seeking zoning waivers for new residential projects to offer a percentage of the units at prices affordable to people making 60 percent of the area’s median income. The required number of affordable units ranges from 10 percent in most cases to 20 percent in designated “pilot zones.”.  The ARO comes into play most often in relatively affluent areas that are attracting new development. It’s complicated and has loopholes that allow developers to set aside far fewer than the ostensibly required number of affordable units. Lightfoot’s affordable housing task force, along with a bloc of progressive aldermen, seems intent on tightening those exemptions and raising the minimum number of below-market units..  I’m all for clamping down on loopholes in the ARO. It’s perfectly appropriate for the city to ask developers who want zoning relief to help advance an important public interest like affordable housing..  But Lightfoot and the City Council should beware of raising the set-aside too high. As Gallun reports, there’s a point at which higher ARO requirements reduce a project’s profitability so significantly that developers will take a pass. That discourages development, defeating the city’s purpose of creating more affordable housing..  ARO is only one tool for advancing that goal, and its effectiveness is limited to areas where developers already want to build. Beefing up ARO requirements might increase racial diversity in expensive parts of town—a clear goal of Lightfoot’s—but won’t have much impact on a major cause of Chicago’s affordability gap: disinvestment in outlying neighborhoods across the city..  Acres of affordable housing have fallen into disrepair or disappeared altogether as capital flight and population loss decimated vast swaths of the South and West sides. Jacking up ARO levels might provide a few more tickets out of those areas, but won’t create large numbers of new affordable units, or serve Lightfoot’s broader aims of reducing inequality and reversing the overall population decline in Chicago..  What’s needed are policies that reward developers for building outside the hottest neighborhoods. Tools such as low-income housing tax credits and low-cost home loans help spur rehabilitation of older homes and new construction in areas ripe for redevelopment. ARO alone, by contrast, largely leaves those neighborhoods to their fate..  Investment in affordable housing would bring people back to places like Englewood and Lawndale, which account for most of Chicago’s recent population drop-off . Initiatives such as the Renew Woodlawn program show the potential for rebirth in areas long abandoned by traditional developers..  Yes, many of those neighborhoods suffer from high crime, failing schools and poverty. But investment in housing is an important first step toward addressing those problems..  Economics also favor construction of affordable homes in neglected areas, where builders can get real estate at prices that reduce development costs. Lower costs allow developers to build lots of homes and make a profit selling them at affordable prices. More affordable homes, faster—that’s the way to defuse a housing affordability crisis.

1447,"Chicago ranked 10th among the most diverse cities in the country U.S. News & World Report finds Chicago’s diversity decreased slightly between 2010 and 2018. Jan 21, 2020, 11:01pm CST Share this story A new U.S. News & World Report analysis finds Chicago is the tenth-most diverse city in the country. File photo Chicago barely cracks the top 10 of the most racially diverse cities in the country, and its diversity has dipped a little since 2010 in part because of the city’s declining black population, according to a new U.S. News & World Report analysis. U.S. News calculated a “diversity score” by analyzing the most recent census data for 66 cities with populations of 300,000 or more. A city’s score represents that two people chosen at random will be from a different ethnic or racial group — a perfect diversity index score is 1. Chicago’s score of 0.75 was ranked 10th on the list. Seven of the top 10 most-diverse cities were in California — the top three were Stockton (0.84); Oakland (0.82); and Sacramento (0.81). At the bottom of the list were Lexington, Kentucky (0.47); Detroit (0.43); and El Paso, Texas (0.43). Despite Detroit receiving the second-lowest diversity score, its diversity increased 21% — the largest growth of any city. Chicago’s diversity fell by 1.1%. Chicago is also behind other cities with comparable population sizes. It ranked behind New York (0.79); Houston (0.77); and Los Angeles (0.76). Each of those cities also experienced a slight dip in its diversity except New York. Overall, the country’s largest cities have become 2% more diverse between 2010 and 2018. About 70% of the 66 cities evaluated grew in racial diversity during that same time. Devon Haynie, assistant managing editor for cities at U.S. News, said U.S. cities are becoming less homogenous, but “diversity doesn’t always translate to equal opportunity.” The report doesn’t factor a city’s racial segregation into its diversity score but relies on 2018 population estimates from the American Community Survey and 2010’s decennial census data. It uses white, black, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic as racial and ethnic groups. “Even the most diverse cities in the country are facing racial inequalities in income levels, educational attainment and homeownership rates,” Haynie said in a statement.

But Mayor Lori Lightfoot is calling in a hero to tackle a different problem — low response rates for the US Census..  Enter the Census Cowboy..  During an unusual news conference Monday, Lightfoot said one simple way to get more resources to communities in need is for people to fill out that survey. To that end, she introduced the Census Cowboy, who will be riding a horse into the 10 city communities with the lowest response rate, in an effort to get more people to fill out the census and be counted..  “When I was a kid I loved the Batman TV show. And, when the city of Gotham had a real difficult challenge, one of the things that the mayor there did is he called out and he sent out a distress signal to Batman,” Lightfoot said. “So, we are doing something similar for the census.

1457,"The city of Chicago has been under a shadow cast by the coronavirus pandemic and a surge in violence. But Mayor Lori Lightfoot is calling in a hero to tackle a different problem — low response rates for the US Census..  Enter the Census Cowboy..  During an unusual news conference Monday, Lightfoot said one simple way to get more resources to communities in need is for people to fill out that survey. To that end, she introduced the Census Cowboy, who will be riding a horse into the 10 city communities with the lowest response rate, in an effort to get more people to fill out the census and be counted..  “When I was a kid I loved the Batman TV show. And, when the city of Gotham had a real difficult challenge, one of the things that the mayor there did is he called out and he sent out a distress signal to Batman,” Lightfoot said. “So, we are doing something similar for the census. And I’m happy to report I’m calling out the Census Cowboy.”.  Lightfoot was quick to point out that the presence of the mounted marvel is not to be celebrated, but to serve as a warning that people are not fulfilling their responsibilities..  Lori Lightfoot Getty Images “So if you see the Census Cowboy come into your neighborhood, that’s not a good thing,” she said. “That means you got to step up and do your part and make sure that you fill out the census.”.  So who is the hero that Chicago needs? According to the Chicago Sun-Times , he is 33-year-old Adam Hollingsworth, a former boxer who gained local notoriety when he rode his trusty steed to protests after George Floyd’s death. Back then, he was known as the “Dread Head Cowboy.”.  Lightfoot has set a goal of 75 percent census participation for her city. In the last census in 2010, they had 66 percent, and so far, some neighborhoods in Chicago are below 40 percent. Lightfoot is hoping that greater participation will result in greater resources for these neighborhoods, some of which were ravaged by looting and violence that spun out of the George Floyd demonstrations..  This is just one approach the mayor has taken with the hope of encouraging greater participation. The homepage for the city’s census website promotes a “Census Challenge,” in which the ward with the highest participation increase wins ice cream delivery for neighborhood children..  So far, the ice cream incentive does not appear to be working. The site notes that statistics will be posted from July 7 to July 17, but so far the ward with the greatest participation has a response rate of less than 1 percent..  Perhaps the Census Cowboy can provide greater inspiration..  “[I]t’s time to giddy-up,” Lightfoot said. “Let’s do this Chicago.

The “census cowboy” made his first appearance as Lightfoot explained that he was her “superhero” to call in when things got out of hand, the way the mayor of Gotham City frequently phoned Batman to assist in the classic television show..  “A fan of Batman, Lightfoot said she was sounding a ‘distress signal’ like the one used to summon the caped crusader by Gotham Police officials to call on the social media star, the Dreadhead Cowboy,” WTTW Chicago reported..

This cowboy is supposed to galvanize the public and bring forward more people to participate in the population count..  ""When I was a kid, I loved the Batman TV show.

The man who has taken on the responsibility to be the Census Cowboy is 33-year old Adam Hollingsworth and the horse he is riding is called Prince. This was not the first time Hollingsworth was in the spotlight. A former boxer, he participated with Prince in the protests following George Floyd's murder also and earned the moniker 'Dread Head Cowboy.'.  This isn't the first out of the box trick used by the local authorities to get people participating in the census. They had also given another inducement by announcing that the ward which registers the highest increase in participation would be rewarded by having ice cream delivered to children residing there..

Earlier this year, she called for the Trump administration to delay the 2020 census, arguing that there is “not enough bandwidth” to conduct the count while responding to a health crisis.

(Santiago Covarrubias/Sun Times via AP).  You gotta give it to Democratic politicians like New York’s Mayor Bill de Blasio and Chicago’s Mayor Lori Lightfoot..  They don’t actually solve any of the problems of their cities. But they sure are busy with the distractions and the attacks on President Donald Trump..  De Blasio tried to make political points by painting Black Lives Matter on the street in front of the Trump Tower in New York City. But he’s done precious little to actually safeguard black lives like that of 1 year old Davell Gardner, Jr or the lives of others as shootings have exploded across the city..  In Chicago, Lightfoot has a similar problem. Shootings in Chicago, always a big problem, have gotten worse..  Lightfoot’s response? Break out the ‘Census Cowboy!’.

She then donned a green cowboy hat and said she was calling in the “Census Cowboy” to help out, as a man on a horse rode into the frame. If he shows up in your neighborhood, she explained, that’s bad, because it means your neighborhood is letting the city down by having people not comply..  From Daily Wire:.  The “Dreadhead Cowboy” is actually a Chicago fixture, per the news network. His real name is Adam Hollingsworth, and he breeds horses in nearby Will County, bringing them into the city to teach young people on the city’s impoverished south side about the practice. He also offers horseback riding lessons, and functions as something of a goodwill ambassador to the city government, appearing as part of marches and protests..  Most recently, Hollingsworth led one of Chicago’s Black Lives Matter marches that took place following the death of George Floyd while in the custody of the Minneapolis Police Department..  She referenced the president during her presser, suggesting he would want a drop in population..  But her failure to react to shootings is causing a continual “drop in population.” 14 people no longer in the population just this weekend, and 391 since the beginning of the year to date so far..

On the same day that 13 people were shot, three fatally, in the city, and as Lightfoot warned that she would reinstate restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19, she addressed the apparently pressing issue of Census completions.

1465,"Illinoisans will soon find out if the state's population has continued to decline. The U.S. Census is scheduled to release its annual population estimates Dec. 30 for the 12 months that ended in July 2019. This estimate will be the final one before the federal agency begins its ten-year count next spring. Last year, Illinois became the sixth most populous state, losing an estimated 45,000 people and falling behind Pennsylvania. “My expectation is that it will probably continue the trend that we’ve had for most of the decade,” said Brian Harger, research specialist with Northern Illinois University’s Center for Governmental Studies. “We will probably show another loss in population.” If Illinois' population for 2019 is significant, it could mean the state would have an unprecedented net loss in total population from 2010 to 2020, Harger said. Population losses come with a myriad of financial implications for Illinois officials. Many federal grants and other assistance is calculated based on population. Fewer people buying homes could lower property values, pushing property taxes higher. Companies seeking to relocate or expand in a state often view population loss as a negative quality because a growing business needs new workers. After reapportionment in 2021, Illinois will likely lose at least one congressional seat because the seats are based on population. “A lot of federal programs use Census-driven formulas for allocating funding to the states,” Harger said. “That loss of population will impact us there.” The argument over who, and especially why, people are leaving Illinois in such numbers often turns political . Some groups have downplayed the losses, noting that Illinois is one of the nation’s most populated states and that the yearly losses have been going on for decades. Others have blamed the state’s high taxes for sending residents to find greener pastures, often fighting the “it’s just retirees going to Florida” argument with IRS data showing more people move to neighboring states than uproot to the Sunshine State.

The 50-something fellow said he was returning to Illinois to get his convertible and to drive it south..  I asked him why he was moving and he told me: “the taxes and the politics.”.  It sounds familiar..  In the two decades that I’ve been writing this column, I’ve received hundreds of letters and emails from folks leaving the Land of Lincoln. The reasons they cite revolve around employment opportunities, tax burden and the state’s political future..  According to Internal Revenue Service data, Illinois has experienced a net loss of 160,000 people since 2010. That’s more than the population of Springfield, Peoria, Rockford or the Illinois Quad-Cities..  Illinois and West Virginia were the only states that lost population during that time..  While middle class people make up the bulk of those leaving the state, the group that had the highest proportion leave are those earning more than $200,000 per year. Proportionately, the second largest group leaving are those earning between $100,000 and $200,000..  That’s bad news. Why? Well, have you ever worked for someone poorer than yourself? Few of us have..  An inevitable consequence of losing these high earners is that they will invest elsewhere. Which means fewer jobs for Illinois. And that, of course, means more people leaving the state..  A second consequence is the tax base shrinks. This means with fewer people paying taxes, those who remain have to pay more to support the government that we have. Of course, higher taxes mean more people leaving Illinois..  It’s a vicious cycle that shows little reason to abate..  In 2016, the Paul Simon Institute at Southern Illinois University conducted a statewide poll and found that 47 percent of respondents would like to leave Illinois and 51% would prefer to remain in the state. Just under 2% said they didn’t know..  Taxes are the single biggest reason people want to leave, the weather is next, followed by government and jobs. Specifically, 27% cite taxes as the motive for departing, 16% say weather, 15% cite government and 13% name jobs and education..  Illinois has the second highest property tax in the nation, just behind New Jersey..  For years, politicians have denied that Illinois has a problem with population loss. Now, most acknowledge the depth of the problem. But few propose solutions. It’s one of those problems that they would rather ignore than address..  That’s unfortunate. We deserve better..

It sounds familiar..  In the two decades that I’ve been writing this column, I’ve received hundreds of letters and emails from folks leaving the Land of Lincoln. The reasons they cite revolve around employment opportunities, tax burden and the state’s political future..  According to Internal Revenue Service data, Illinois has experienced a net loss of 160,000 people since 2010. That’s more than the population of Springfield, Peoria, Rockford or the Illinois Quad-Cities..  Illinois and West Virginia were the only states that lost population during that time..  While middle class people make up the bulk of those leaving the state, the group that had the highest proportion leave are those earning more than $200,000 per year. Proportionately, the second largest group leaving are those earning between $100,000 and $200,000..  That’s bad news. Why? Well, have you ever worked for someone poorer than yourself? Few of us have..  An inevitable consequence of losing these high earners is that they will invest elsewhere. Which means fewer jobs for Illinois. And that, of course, means more people leaving the state..  A second consequence is the tax base shrinks. This means with fewer people paying taxes, those who remain have to pay more to support the government that we have. Of course, higher taxes mean more people leaving Illinois..  It’s a vicious cycle that shows little reason to abate..  In 2016, the Paul Simon Institute at Southern Illinois University conducted a statewide poll and found that 47 percent of respondents would like to leave Illinois and 51% would prefer to remain in the state. Just under 2% said they didn’t know..  Taxes are the single biggest reason people want to leave, the weather is next, followed by government and jobs. Specifically, 27% cite taxes as the motive for departing, 16% say weather, 15% cite government and 13% name jobs and education..  Illinois has the second highest property tax in the nation, just behind New Jersey..  For years, politicians have denied that Illinois has a problem with population loss. Now, most acknowledge the depth of the problem. But few propose solutions. It’s one of those problems that they would rather ignore than address..  That’s unfortunate. We deserve better..

1470,"The primary election in Illinois will take place on March 17, the same day many Illinoisans will be celebrating St. Patrick’s Day. Primary elections often have historically lower turnout than general elections. In 2018, turnout for all eligible voters was just 19.9 percent compared with the historic general election turnout of 53 percent of all eligible voters, according to the census . In Illinois for the general election, 51.4 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot, while under half of those people voted in the primary..  Unlike the general election, primaries don’t result in an election to office. They are used to narrow down who will appear on the ballot in November. Although it’s the most spotlighted election, there’s more at stake in the primary than just choosing a nominee for president. In Illinois there are contests in congressional, Statehouse, City Council and State’s Attorney races, to name a few..  Before someone can take part in this consequential process, they need to register to vote. You can register to vote even on election day. If you’re from out of state and have previously registered somewhere else, you can still register to vote in Chicago. If you’re registered in suburban Illinois, you still must re-register with a Chicago address in order to vote in the city..  Illinois is one of 25 states with an open primary, meaning you’re not required to affiliate with a political party. But, you can only vote on one of the party’s ballots..  Where to register.  We’re past the online registration deadline, so with or without an Illinois ID, you must register in person. From today until March 16, there are locations in all 50 wards where you can register, and cast your ballot immediately after..  Where to vote.  There are 2,069 precincts in Chicago, more than the entire state of Iowa. On March 17, you must go to the polling site for the precinct you live in in order to vote. But you may want to take advantage of Chicago’s early voting policy, which allows you to vote in any of the city’s 52 sites before election day. The closest location to the Lincoln Park campus is just right down the street at 1150 W. Fullerton in the Lincoln Park Library. In the Loop, you can vote at the Loop Super Site at 191 N. Clark St..  On election day though, you must vote at the precinct polling place for the address you live at. To find your precinct polling site, visit Chicago Elections.gov and navigate to the “Your Voter Information” dropdown under the “Voting” menu. The site for students that live in DePaul’s on-campus housing is the Sullivan Athletic Center..  What to bring.  You need two forms of identification to register to vote. One with proof of identity. This could be:.  – Passport or Military ID.  – Driver’s License or State ID card.  – College/University/School/Work ID.  – Lease, mortgage or deed to home.  – Credit or debit card.  – Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid card.  – Insurance card.  – Civic, union or professional membership card.  – LINK/Public Aid/Department of Human Services card.  – Illinois FOID card.  Another, with proof of address.

1472,"House Speaker Michael Madigan during Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s budget address in Springfield on February 19 Photo: Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune.  In the early 2000s, State Sen. Barack Obama gerrymandered his way to a political comeback..  Obama had just lost a Democratic primary for Congress to Rep. Bobby Rush, a challenge that caused some hard feelings among black activists on the South Side. But then, as it so often did during his political career, the luck of a draw favored Obama..  After the 2000 Census, the Republican Senate and the Democratic House failed to agree on a new legislative map, as did an eight-member committee of four Democrats and four Republicans. So Secretary of State Jesse White asked each party to submit a candidate for a ninth member. As dictated by the state constitution, the candidate must be selected at random, so White placed the slips in a replica of Abe Lincoln’s stovepipe hat. He drew the name of Michael Bilandic, the former Democratic mayor of Chicago. The Democrats would draw the new map..  Obama had been elected to represent the 13th State Senate District, which stretched from Hyde Park west to Englewood. He asked instead to represent a narrow band following the Lake Michigan shoreline from 95th Street to the Gold Coast, effectively becoming a lakefront senator rather than a South Side senator. That way, some of the most generous Democratic donors in the state, many of whom live in tony lakeside properties, would see his name on a ballot and his face on legislative updates. Obama’s redrawing of the 13th district to promote his political fortunes was a classic example of a politician choosing his voters rather than the other way around — a central complaint of gerrymandering opponents..  The Fair Maps Amendment , filed before the General Assembly earlier this month, presents a possible solution. The constitutional amendment assigns the next remap to a 17-member bipartisan commission, which excludes legislators or lobbyists. If passed and approved by voters this November, the new process would take effect in 2021..  Fat chance of House Speaker Michael Madigan allowing that to happen. After the 2010 election, Madigan drew a map so unfair that Politico wrote it “punched his ticket to the partisan hall of fame.”.  “Madigan’s masterstroke, and its expected effect, ranks him with other storied pols whose mapmaking exploits have become the stuff of political legend,” the publication marveled..  Madigan’s map, which crammed as many Republicans into as few districts as possible, worked exactly as he intended it. In the 2012 elections, the state’s congressional delegation went from 11 Republicans and eight Democrats to 12 Democrats and six Republicans. (Illinois lost a seat after the 2010 Census. Madigan made sure it was a Republican seat: the downstate 19th Congressional District.) In the State House, Democrats gained seven seats, providing Madigan with a coveted supermajority — the 60 percent advantage required to override a governor’s veto..  In his book Ratf**ked: The True Story Behind the Secret Plan to Steal America’s Democracy , former Salon editor David Daley mostly blames Republicans for drawing maps that thwart the will of the voters, especially after the 2010 elections gave them control of so many legislatures. For example, a 2012 Republican remap in Wisconsin allowed the party to win 60 percent of the legislative seats despite receiving 174,000 fewer votes than the Democrats..  Daley does, however, give credit to the Illinois Democrats, who are renowned for their political shadiness. Of his nine most egregiously gerrymandered states, only Illinois is controlled by Democrats..  “In Illinois, Democrats who controlled redistricting after 2010… attached pieces of urban, Democratic Chicago to the neighboring Republican suburbs, diluting the Republican vote,” Daley writes..  A Fair Maps Amendment likely would be approved by Illinois voters. In 2018, a similar measure got 61 percent of the vote in Michigan. In 14 states , legislative maps are drawn by independent commissions..  To get on the ballot, though, the amendment must be approved by three-fifths of the House and Senate by May 3. Since Madigan controls the legislative calendar, that seems unlikely..  As a candidate, Gov. J.B. Pritzker spoke in favor of a Fair Maps Amendment. But after relying on Madigan to pass his ambitious agenda last year, he didn’t mention the amendment in his State of the State address last month. Instead, he promised afterward to “veto any unfair map that gets presented to me.”.  The Democrats, though, could override that veto, using the supermajority they won as a result of the last unfair map. In other words: A well-gerrymandered map guarantees a party the power to continue gerrymandering.","[0.5077396631240845, 0.4922603964805603]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5077396631240845

Almost two-thirds of households in the greater Los Angeles area experienced earnings declines over the past two months compared with 43% in Washington, D.C., where federal-government jobs have been largely protected, according to a new report by the U.S. Census Bureau. In New York City, more than half of residents suffered a drop in income. Income Losses.  Here’s a look at how Americas largest 10 metros have varied:.  The pandemic has affected people with lower incomes to a much greater degree than top earners. Generally, those able to work from home have held onto jobs during the sheltering-in-place orders -- a feat not possible for most lower-paying service, retail and blue-collar positions..  Hispanic households experienced the largest income drops in seven of the largest 10 metros, followed by African Americans who saw earnings declines of more than 60% in half of the 10 largest metros..  In all 10 of the largest metros, a larger share of those with more education were able to sustain their incomes. But, the differences vary. In Dallas 67.8% of households with only a high-school education saw earnings fall compared to 45.4% in Houston..  Most people with at least a college degree were able to maintain their salaries in all 10 metros. And less than of third of such households saw incomes fall in Boston, San Francisco and Washington, D.C..

1474,"Chicago Tribune | Jun 04, 2020 | 4:02 PM The Van Buren Street lobby of the Old Post Office on Sept. 18, 2019. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) A headline in the Chicago Tribune’s online business section Thursday forced us to do a double take: “Old Post Office partners with team behind Empty Bottle, Thalia Hall to add concerts, cultural events and food hall,” by columnist Ryan Ori. Must be an old story. New investment downtown? Today? In the midst of a global pandemic and days after fallout over the police killing of George Floyd led to widespread destruction of property? Advertisement Check the date of the story. Check again. June 4, 2020. Not an old story. Chicago’s heart is still beating. Old Post Office developer 601W Cos. wants to bring restaurants and entertainment to the post office complex, which began housing tenants last fall and attracting investors after more than two decades of post office vacancy. Advertisement From Ori: “The project includes a more than 18,000-square-foot food hall on the ground floor, accessible from the building’s historic lobby and from a large riverfront plaza. That outdoor space along with the lobby and potentially its 3.5-acre rooftop park could be used for live music, culinary events and other arts and entertainment, according to 16” on Center. The events space, as well as the food hall, will be open to the public.” Something to celebrate. The historic, hulking building that straddles Ida B. Wells Parkway, after years of neglect and abandonment, has became a barometer of Chicago’s investment attractiveness, despite shaky city finances, too-high crime rates and an exodus of residents from Illinois during the last six years — especially in pockets of Chicago’s South and West sides. Then came the coronavirus pandemic, which is forcing some Post Office tenants to cut staff, including Uber. Followed by widespread looting and vandalism throughout the Loop and into the suburbs. So it was welcome news to read that investors still see Chicago as a gem, even when bandaged and broken. The massive multibillion-dollar redevelopment project at the Post Office marches on. And then, downstate A brutal economic downturn brought on by a pandemic is not a time that most corporations would choose to leave money on the table. But last month, the automaker Rivian informed the Town Council of Normal, Illinois, that it would decline a $1 million grant the city had pledged back in 2016. “We feel these funds would better serve our community by remaining with the municipality,” said a letter from CEO RJ Scaringe. It was a heartening gesture by Rivian for the community that did so much to support the company’s bold venture in electric vehicles. With tax incentives, Michigan-based Rivian agreed in 2016 to take over a closed Mitsubishi Motors plant that had once employed 3,000 workers. At the time, City Manager Mark Peterson said he had “been encouraged by their clear commitment to be involved in the community.” Apparently that commitment was genuine. Electric truck startup company Rivian is located in the former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Ill. (Camille Fine / Chicago Tribune) Rivian, which will build pickup trucks and SUVs, has not been immune to the economic storm. In April, Ford canceled a joint venture to build an electric Lincoln vehicle, a decision it ascribed to “the current environment.” Rivian had previously delayed its production launch until next year. Low gas prices are no boon to electric vehicles. But the long-term future for such cars and trucks looks promising, and Rivian looks like a company that should last. In December, it announced $1.3 billion in investments by such companies as Amazon, Ford and T. Rowe Price. It has been working to develop a delivery van for Amazon, whose sales have surged as Americans shelter in place. Its R1T pickup has won attention from car buffs for its advertised zero-to-60 time of 3.0 seconds and a feature that allows it to turn around in place, like a tank. This is the sort of story that should be more common in Illinois, a manufacturing power that has lost a lot of its mojo. In 2018, our total manufacturing output totaled $108 billion — just $6 billion more than Indiana, which has only about half the population. The manufacturing share of our employment is less than 10%, compared with 17% in Indiana, 16% in Wisconsin and 14% in Iowa. Illinois has plenty going for it: a central location, a highly trained labor force and first-rate universities. But its notorious state debt, high taxes and penchant for heavy-handed regulation have encouraged companies to locate elsewhere — one reason the state has lost population for six years in a row. The state urgently needs to make changes that will convince corporations and entrepreneurs that they can invest and produce here with confidence.

1476,"This April 5, 2020, photo shows a 2020 census letter mailed to a U.S. resident in Detroit. (AP Photo / Paul Sancya).  JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — The U.S. Census Bureau needs more time to wrap up the once-a-decade count because of the coronavirus, opening the possibility of delays in drawing new legislative districts that could help determine what political party is in power, what laws pass or fail and whether communities of color get a voice in their states..  Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors The number of people counted and their demographics guide how voting districts for the U.S. House and state legislatures are redrawn every 10 years. The monthslong delay in census data could make a divisive process more complicated, potentially forcing lawmakers into costly special sessions to complete the work or postponing some primary elections..  “It will pinch the timing for sure on everybody,” said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who tracks redistricting nationwide. “For a few states, that’s incredibly meaningful.”.  Despite the complications, advocates, lawmakers and others largely embraced the census delay as necessary to get a complete count..  With the U.S. so politically polarized, redistricting plays a major role in whether Republicans or Democrats drive the agenda in each state and how those lawmakers’ decisions can affect people’s lives. Parties that win large legislative majorities can tilt policy to the left or right on abortion, guns, taxes and other contentious issues..  Redistricting typically is done by state lawmakers and governors, but an increasing number of states have shifted to special commissions..  The new districts frequently are challenged in court for not properly representing minority communities or for favoring one party over another in what is called gerrymandering..  After Republicans scored big statehouse victories in the 2010, for example, they used their enhanced power in 2011 to draw districts to their advantage in some states, spawning Democratic-backed lawsuits that spanned much of the next decade. Democrats have historically done the same when they were in control..  The census delay could trigger more lawsuits..  Because of stay-at-home orders designed to combat the coronavirus, the Census Bureau put off hiring and training temporary census takers in mid-March. They won’t start knocking on doors of people who haven’t answered the questionnaire until August. The bureau pushed back the deadline to wrap up the count from the end of July to the end of October..  Congress must approve the Census Bureau’s request to delay turning over redistricting data to the states from the end of March 2021 to the end of July 2021..  A delay could have big implications for states with legislative elections next year — New Jersey and Virginia..  “There will not be enough time for redistricting, candidate filing, preparing for an election and running a general election. There simply won’t be time for it,” said Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida..  California, Illinois, North Carolina and Texas all have early 2022 primaries, which could create a compressed schedule for new maps. Some states could require special legislative sessions to complete the work before candidates file to run for office in 2022. Others may have to postpone candidate filing, said Michael Li, a redistricting attorney at New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice..  The New Jersey Constitution requires a commission to adopt new maps within 30 days of receiving census data and candidates to run in those new districts that same year. The state’s primary elections are scheduled for June 8, 2021, seven weeks before the Census Bureau’s new deadline for turning over the population figures..  “A delay in the release of the census information has the potential to throw everything out of whack,” said Al Barlas, Republican chairman of New Jersey’s redistricting commission..  “There’s constitutional ramifications to this. There’s obviously timelines and deadlines,” Barlas added. “Do you move the primary from June back? … Do you do a gubernatorial primary and everybody-else-primary in June, but do you do a legislative primary later, perhaps in August or right after Labor Day? Honestly, I don’t know.”.  In 2011, Virginia moved its primary from June 14 to Aug. 23 to allow time for redistricting after receiving census data. A similar delay could be needed for its 2021 election, which is scheduled for the second Tuesday in June..  Virginia voters are deciding this November on a constitutional amendment creating a bipartisan commission to draw the districts. If approved, the commission would have 45 days after receiving the census numbers to submit new maps to lawmakers for a vote..  State Sen. George Barker, a Democrat who sponsored the amendment, said it’s unclear whether the 2021 primary could be delayed long enough to allow time for the work. If not, candidates may have to run under current districts in 2021, he said..  “If the data isn’t in until sometime in early to mid-July, it would be very, very difficult to get it done in time to even come close to meeting requirements for both the primary and a general election,” Barker said.","[0.5012667775154114, 0.49873319268226624]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5012667775154114
1477,"This undated photo provided by Michael Thomas in April 2020 shows a clouded sulphur butterfly in Cromwell, Conn. (Mike Thomas via AP).  KENSINGTON, Maryland (AP) — The world has lost more than one quarter of its land-dwelling insects in the past 30 years, according to researchers whose big picture study of global bug decline paints a disturbing but more nuanced problem than earlier research..  Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors From bees and other pollinators crucial to the world’s food supply to butterflies that beautify places, the bugs are disappearing at a rate of just under 1% a year, with lots of variation from place to place, according to a study in Thursday’s journal Science..  That’s a tinier population decline than found by some smaller localized studies, which had triggered fears of a so-called insect apocalypse . But it still adds up to something “awfully alarming,” said entomologist Roel van Klink of the German Centre for Integrative Biology, the study’s lead author..  “The decline across insect orders on land is jaw dropping,” said Michigan State University butterfly expert Nick Haddad, who wasn’t part of the study. “Ongoing decline on land at this rate will be catastrophic for ecological systems and for humans. Insects are pollinators, natural enemies of pests, decomposers and besides that, are critical to functioning of all Earth’s ecosystems.”.  Insect declines are worst in North America, especially the Midwestern United States, and in parts of Europe, but the drop appears to be leveling off in the U.S. in recent years, said the study that pulled together earlier research on more than 10,000 species with data from 1,676 locations..  The Midwest lost 4% of its bugs a year. The big global losses seem to be around urban and suburban areas and croplands, where bugs are losing their food and habitat, van Klink said..  This September 2019 photo provided by Michael Thomas shows a clouded sulphur butterfly in Deering, N.H. (Michael Thomas via AP).  University of Delaware entomologist Douglas Tallamy, who wasn’t part of the study, said he would drive through the Midwest where there were supposed to be lots of butterflies and other insects but would see only corn and soybeans in an insect desert..  Some outside scientists said the results made sense, but worried that the study lacked research and data from some large areas, such as the tropics and Africa..  Co-author Ann Swengel, a citizen scientist who’s tracked butterflies for more than 30 years, recalled that when driving around Wisconsin a few decades ago, she would “look out in a field and you’d see all these Sulphur butterflies around. I can’t think of the last time that I’ve seen that.”.  The study detailed quite different losses from place to place and from decade to decade. That tells scientists that “we’re not looking for a single stressor or we’re not looking a global phenomenon that is stressing insects in the same way,” said University of Connecticut insect expert David Wagner, who wasn’t part of the study. What’s happening, he said, is “absolutely intolerable.”.  Van Klink didn’t find a link to climate change in the insect loss. But he did see an overarching theme of creeping urbanization, which absorbs land where insects live and eat, and general loss of habitat from farming that takes away weeds and flowers bugs need..  While land bugs were dwindling, freshwater insects, such as mayflies, dragonflies and mosquitoes, are increasing at more than 1% a year, the study found. That’s faster than land bugs were disappearing. But those thriving freshwater insects are a tiny percentage of bugs in the world..  That improvement of freshwater species, likely because rivers and streams got cleaner, shows hope, scientists said..  Swengel said she saw another sign of hope on a cloudy day last year in Wisconsin: she and her husband counted 3,848 monarchs, reflecting recent local efforts to improve habitat for the colorful migrating butterfly..  “It was absolutely magnificent,” she said. “It’s not too late.”","[0.5013901591300964, 0.4986098110675812]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5013901591300964

1479,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s call for authorizing state bankruptcy triggered an avalanche of stories revealing a mountain of misunderstanding about bankruptcy and government..  First, what does “bankrupt” mean? We use the word to mean “unable to pay debts when due,” and, in this usage, bankrupt is synonymous with “insolvent.” It is a term fraught with shame, for it connotes failure. For many centuries, the bankrupt faced jail, personal servitude and even death..  “Bankruptcy” is a description of a legal process by which a debtor is relieved of unpayable debts. A legal innovation of the early 1700s, bankruptcy frees debtors from debtor prisons and a lifetime of servitude, forces creditors to take a loss, and gives debtors a fresh start..  The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to pass laws on the subject of bankruptcy, and it passed the first durable statute setting forth a process for relieving debtors of their debts in the 1890s. This statute has been a success, and now the word “bankruptcy” is often synonymous with the current bankruptcy code, but Congress retains the power to change that statute and experiment with laws on the subject of bankruptcy..  In commercial bankruptcies, stockholders are typically wiped out and the creditors become owners. In personal bankruptcy, creditors take the debtor’s investments and (with some exceptions) assets, but the debtor is free to start again..  These are both fundamentally different from a bankruptcy reorganization of a government . When a government is “bankrupt” (i.e. insolvent), it does not have enough money to pay its creditors and serve its constituents. Insolvent governments cut services and raise taxes in order to pay creditors. Residents being served by insolvent governments are hurt because they pay more for less service than residents served by governments that are solvent..  When a government goes “through bankruptcy,” it’s both a political and a financial process. Creditors aren’t given ownership of the parks, schools and roads, no repo man comes to take back schoolbooks, and banks and pension funds don’t elect the city council. There’s no liquidation sale and the government doesn’t board up its windows..  Instead, the government keeps assets it holds for the benefit of the people and is empowered to renegotiate its debts. Pensions are adjusted, but preserved and secured, while abuses are eliminated, and funded debt is reduced to a manageable level..  People gain, creditor claims are reduced, but politicians who mismanaged the government may be embarrassed and oppose bankruptcy, especially when the government’s creditors are political supporters..  Bear in mind that each state must be a republic: a government of the people, by the people and for the people. So, when a governmental entity such as a municipality or city goes “through bankruptcy,” reducing its bonded debt and renegotiating pensions to make them affordable, the result is a republic that’s more responsive to its people. The share of government revenue that is required to pay creditors is reduced, eliminating the pressure to raise taxes and empowering the government to improve services to its residents..  This is not academic. Illinois is already insolvent, as its comptroller, Susana Mendoza, recently acknowledged to the Financial Times :.  Illinois, according to Ms. Mendoza, could run for “30 seconds” [on its rainy-day fund]. The state was paying 12% interest on a backlog of $17 billion in unpaid bills when she came into office in late 2016. After a bond deal, she was able to pay it down to $8 billion..  Now, she has let the state’s creditors know some terms will be extended again. She is prioritizing education and day care, pensions and debt service payments, as well as anything that may be reimbursed by federal dollars, such as health insurance for the poor, or the coronavirus response..  For everything else, she says, she is trying to be as open as possible. “I feel like Jimmy Stewart in ‘It’s a Wonderful Life,”’ she said. “Because you’re having to tell people, ‘I know that the state owes you this money. I know it’s your money, but I don’t have it all, right?”’.  She summarizes the situation in Illinois accurately. The state prioritizes debt and pension payments, isn’t paying creditors when due and operates on a day-to-day basis like an insolvent savings and loan. Illinois’s debt is rated as nearly “junk debt” and Illinois pays a significant premium because bondholders know Illinois will eventually renegotiate and reduce its debt..  This was Illinois before COVID; the shutdown and its leadership’s request for a massive federal bailout has merely revealed Illinois’s insolvency to a broader public..  Illinois’s tax burden is already among the heaviest in the United States, and an ever-diminishing share of the state’s budget goes to services for people. State aid to municipalities serving low-income residents is redirected into pension funds, leaving zombie shell governments behind. Illinoisans are being squeezed to pay creditors, but our residents are still free to move out of state -- so is it any wonder that our population shrinks year after year?.  Congress has not enacted a law providing for a process by which a state like Illinois could restructure and reduce its debts. A state “bankruptcy” could take many forms and need not involve turning the state over to a bankruptcy judge and doesn’t even need to be called “bankruptcy.”.  In any event, Illinois has been mismanaged for so long that its debts are now unpayable, and the people of Illinois need federal help to force state creditors to renegotiate and adjust their claims so the state can focus on serving people again. Today, Illinois serves its creditors first, and the people only to the extent there’s any money left over. However labeled or implemented, reducing Illinois’s debt gives power to the people.","[0.5003449320793152, 0.4996550977230072]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5003449320793152
1480,"After years of unsuccessful legislative and citizen-led efforts to strip the General Assembly of the power to draw congressional and legislative district boundaries, the coronavirus shutdown appears to have doomed any chance of constitutional redistricting reform before the state’s maps are set for another decade..  Going into the spring legislative session, backers of change were hoping to make one more effort at getting something done before a looming deadline. In February, lawmakers filed identical state constitutional amendments in the Illinois House and Senate that would hand over the power to draw and approve district boundaries to an independent, citizen-led commission..  Advertisement The amendment’s ratification would require a three-fifths majority in both legislative chambers as well as approval from Illinois voters. Legislators have until May 3 to put the amendment on November’s ballot, and the joint resolution’s sponsors admit that’s essentially impossible..  The General Assembly, which has not convened since early March, has canceled session days in Springfield until at least May 5..  “I’m very disappointed that it’s come to this moment in time — in an effort that we’ve been working on for all of the past decade,” said Rep. Ryan Spain, a Peoria Republican who is sponsoring the bill in the House. “It just makes me look back and really feel such tremendous disappointment and frustration that we didn’t engage and get this issue solved much earlier on, when we had so many chances to do so.”.  Redistricting occurs every 10 years after the U.S. census to account for changes in population. This spring is the last chance for Illinois legislators to overhaul how district maps are decided before they are redrawn in 2021.","[0.8368056416511536, 0.16319432854652405]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.8368056416511536

Charles Rex Arbogast/AP hide caption.  toggle caption Charles Rex Arbogast/AP Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker is fighting a lawsuit challenging his right to extend the state's stay-at-home order by 30 days..  Charles Rex Arbogast/AP The fight over COVID-19 has become a legal battle in Illinois, pitting a Republican state lawmaker from a rural county against the Democratic governor..  Darren Bailey argued the state's latest stay-at-home order was taking an unfair economic toll on his constituents in Clay County. So he sued last week. And won. Sort of..  A Clay County circuit court judge issued a temporary restraining order against the state's extension of its stay-at-home policy..  That ruling only applies to one person, though — Bailey..  Everyone else living in Clay County, and the rest of the state, still must abide by the 30-day extension set by Gov. J.B. Pritzker..  ""Enough is enough,"" Bailey said in a statement. ""I filed this lawsuit on behalf of myself and my constituents who are ready to go back to work and resume a normal life."".  Pritzker is appealing the judge's order..  At his daily press conference Tuesday, the governor called the lawsuit a ""cheap political stunt"" and the court decision ""dangerous."" He said it invites others to try for exemptions to an order that relies on collective action to keep people safe..  ""I know the virus is causing devastating consequences, just as it has caused tens of thousands to become ill and thousands to die,"" Pritzker said, ""and responsible people understand the consequences of opening too early."".  Clay County's population is nearly 14,000, according to the 2010 Census. So far, it has only two confirmed cases of COVID-19. Bailey lives in Xenia, Ill., about 200 miles south of Chicago..  He argues the stay-at-home order is causing an economic pandemic in an area not hard-hit by the disease and that Pritzker did not have the authority to extend the order. The original deadline was April 30; it's now May 31..  Across the country, decisions about stay-at-home orders and reopening economies by governors, regardless of party, have increasingly turned into political fights. An attorney for Rep. Bailey says he has received heavy interest from others who want to take similar action against the governor..  Illinois has reported more than 48,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 2,000 deaths. Pritzker says the danger has not passed yet, and credits the stay-at-home order with flattening the curve and drastically slowing the number of cases in Illinois..  Pritzker says he confident the ruling against him will be overturned.","[0.6939052939414978, 0.3060947358608246]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.6939052939414978
1482,"Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday denounced an Illinois state representative, calling the lawsuit that defeated his stay-at-home order in court “a cheap political stunt.”.  Referring to state Rep. Darren Bailey, R-Xenia, only as “the state representative from the 109th District,” Pritzker said Bailey’s successful lawsuit in Clay County circuit court on Monday was “designed so that the representative can see his name in headlines.”.  “This ruling only applies to one person because it was only ever about one person,” Pritzker said during his daily COVID-19 briefing in Chicago..  A judge ruled Monday that the governor’s extended 30-day stay-at-home order cannot apply to Bailey. Pritzker said that decision sets “a dangerous precedent.”.  “Slowing the spread of this virus is critical to saving lives by insuring our health care system has the resources to treat patients who get sick,” he said. “And we will not stop this virus if because of this ruling any resident can petition to be exempted from aspects of the orders that rely on collective action to keep us all safe.”.  Pritzker, via Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, will appeal that ruling because “the state has acted well within its legal authority to protect the health of the public,” he said..  The governor added later in the briefing that “it is the history of the state of Illinois that we have sometimes successive declarations of disaster,” such as after floods..  “Pandemics don't live by a 30-day timeframe,” he said. Harrisburg council won't defy governor's stay-at-home order, encourages letter-writing campaign instead.  Bailey’s district includes Jasper County, which has the third-highest COVID-19 infection rate in the state — 44 cases among 9,610 residents, according to a Capitol News Illinois calculation using 2019 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates..  Pritzker also said Bailey’s House district “happens to have among the lowest hospital bed availability and ventilators in the state, making it uniquely ill-equipped to respond to a surge in cases.” Rural Randolph County has one of the highest COVID-19 infection rates in Illinois. Here’s what happened..  Pritzker cited a poll published by Illinois political blog Capitol Fax that found 77% of people at least somewhat approve of the current stay-at-home order and 71% at least somewhat approve of how the governor has handled the outbreak..  “I don't think there's a partisan divide. I do think that there are a few people who are trying to take political advantage at the moment,” Pritzker said. “In the middle of the pandemic that is killing people, they're politicizing it.”.  State Rep. John Cabello, a Republican from Machesney Park, said Tuesday that he intends to challenge Pritzker’s stay-at-home order but is “trying to make it for everyone.” CDC doctor: Rural areas shouldn't let guard down as big cities bear brunt of COVID-19.  The Illinois Department of Public Health on Tuesday reported 144 new deaths from COVID-19 over the past 24 hours, the state’s highest one-day total. Those deaths push the state’s total over 2,000 to 2,125..  IDPH also reported 2,219 new cases of the disease, bringing that total to 48,102. Many of those patients have recovered, IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said..  Ezike said 49% of people surveyed who tested positive reported they were symptom-free two weeks after their positive test. For people between two and four weeks removed from their positive test, 61% felt recovered, while 74% who were more than four weeks from testing positive felt recovered..  “I hope that’s seen as encouraging news, that people do recover,” Ezike said..  Ezike added that as of Monday, 4,738 people in Illinois were hospitalized for COVID-19. Of those, 1,245 were in intensive care and 778 of those are on a ventilator..  Tuesday was also the fourth straight day that the state reported more than 10,000 tests over a 24-hour period after first reaching that daily milestone on Saturday. IDPH reported 14,561 newly completed tests on Tuesday, brining that total to 242,189, which is about 2% of Illinois’ population..  A team of medical experts from Poland is assisting the Illinois National Guard with the state’s COVID-19 response, an extension of Illinois’ long-standing cultural and political relationship with the European nation..  The nine-member team of four doctors, three nurses, an EMT and a logistical coordinator will assist the 1,120 deployed Guard members. Soldiers’ tasks have included running drive-thru testing sites, distributing personal protective equipment to hospitals and local health departments and supporting medical operations at two correctional centers..  “I am incredibly humbled by the gracious spirit of these citizen soldiers who have left their families and their civilian jobs to assist their fellow Illinoisans,” Pritzker said..  Illinois’ partnership with the Polish military dates back to 1993. Since then, Polish forces and the Illinois National Guard have fought together in Iraq and Afghanistan, and leaders have made multiple trips to each other’s nations..  The Polish team will be able to bring to Illinois their experience of fighting COVID-19 in their native country, as well as Italy, one of the nations hardest hit by the novel coronavirus..  “We have fought side-by-side for many years, and now we fight the pandemic together,” said Adjutant General Richard Neely, head of the Guard..  Piotr Janicki, Poland’s Consul General for Chicago said the city is the most Polish city in America and that 8% of Illinoisans are of Polish descent..  “We have to fight coronavirus, and I cannot imagine a better place for military personnel from Poland than Chicago to come and help,” he said.

In that post, I placed Chicago in the special category of American cities that I called the “basket cases” — places with declining populations, astoundingly high rates of violent crime, in every case mostly black on black, and, of course, uninterrupted rule by leftist Democrats for generations. I had this to say about Chicago: You may ask, is Chicago really basket case? . . . The downtown is in good shape, with new condos and office towers; the near north side is upscale and attractive. But the population has gone from a peak of 3,620,962 in the 1950 census to just 2,695,598 in 2010. [And if instead of staying downtown you take] the Green Line el south from the loop to the end of the line, . . . you will observe huge deteriorated public housing projects surrounded by vast vacant areas and abandoned private buildings. The violent crime rate also clearly qualifies Chicago for the label of basket case. Murders hit a peak of 756 in 2016 (about 28 per hundred thousand people, compared to a rate for the U.S. as a whole of about 5 per 100,000). After a few years of modest declines, murders are on track to equal or top the 756 this year, with 440 through July . In fact, July 2020 just set a new record for most murders in a month, with 105 . Of course, Chicago has been ruled entirely by Democrats for generations. Its last Republican mayor left office in 1931. Of 50 alderman in the city, 46 are Democrats and the other 4 are Independents. In the 2016 election , the city of Chicago voted for Clinton over Trump by 84% to 13%. Which brings us up to the last couple of days. Apparently, on Sunday there was an incident where the Chicago police shot and injured a black suspect. The police claim that the suspect was armed and had shot at them first; but they have no video to prove that. Whether the police behaved wrongly remains to be established, and if they did, the officers in question should be dealt with accordingly. But there is no justifying what followed. On Sunday night into Monday there was a first wave of looting in the downtown area. On Monday, the Chicago chapter of Black Lives Matter put out a press release that dropped all pretense of “peaceful protests” and explicitly sought to justify the looting, while also threatening further violence: The mayor clearly has not learned anything since [the killing of George Floyd in] May, and she would be wise to understand that the people will keep rising up until the CPD is abolished and our Black communities are fully invested in. Contrary to Mayor Lightfoot’s position, Black lives are and always will be more important than downtown corporations who siphon Tax Increment Financing (T.I.F.) money, while avoiding taxes, and exploiting the labor of Black and Brown Chicagoans. These corporations have “looted” more from our communities than a few protesters ever could. . . . [Some] commentators seem to believe that the immense wealth that has been hoarded in downtown Chicago is in some way all of ours. The South and West sides have seen no benefits to this hoarding. . . . When protesters attack high-end retail stores that are owned by the wealthy and service the wealthy, that is not “our” city and has never been meant for us. At a BLM demonstration yesterday, a large banner explicitly advocated looting: Then last night, a second wave of looting erupted in Chicago, including both in the downtown and in the luxury shopping district just north of downtown known as the “Miracle Mile.” There are many videos of the looting, which appears to have been orchestrated on social media.

And again, even if you assume the worst about the police incident, how is looting an appropriate response? Encouraging young black people to go out on looting sprees is making them completely unemployable in any professional job and ruining whatever chance they might have had for high paying jobs and careers. The demonstrators shout “black lives matter” while they destroy black lives by the hundreds or thousands. We are witnessing the complete dead end of the progressive movement in Marxist idiocy.

1487,"Illinois-based Hospice of the Kankakee Valley has rebranded as Uplifted Health, continuing a nationwide trend of providers updating their public image to reflect a more diversified suite of services..  The newly christened Uplifted Health typically has an average daily census of 180 patients, though the organization has seen a slight dip due to restricted nursing home access during the COVID-19 pandemic..  Rebranding also helps providers shed the stigma that is often associated with the word “hospice.” Uplifted hopes that removing “hospice” from their name will help them connect with patients further upstream in the course of their illnesses. Advertisement.  “We know that there’s resistance to people accepting the idea and the word ‘hospice.’ And we know that in our hospice, approximately 40% of all patients who are admitted die within seven days,” said Uplifted Health Executive Director Connie Lemon. “Patients are dying on hospice, but they’re not on for very long. So it’s really limiting their access to all the care that they could be receiving. Removing any psychological barriers we can will help with acceptance. We think it will be a little less scary if patients don’t have to hear the hospice word every single day of care.”.  The company worked with the North Carolina-based marketing firm the Anoroc Agency, which specializes in hospice rebranding. Anecdotal evidence indicates that providers who update their brand to remove the term “hospice” tend to see an increase in patient census, according to Lemon..  Like many providers, Hospice of the Kankakee Valley had launched service lines beyond their initial hospice mission, including palliative care, community-wide bereavement care and a volunteer-led initiative called Transitions that provides pre-hospice support for as long as 24 months. The Uplifted Health moniker is expected to better reflect the full range of their services..  Uplifted has 80% market share in its multi-county service area, which sees nearly 78% hospice utilization among Medicare descendants, Lemon told Hospice News. The national average for utilization is slightly higher than 50%, according to Services..  The company considered postponing the rebrand as it contends with the impact of the pandemic, but ultimately decided that the time was right nevertheless..  “Our final, kind of striking, answer was that it’s all the more reason to do it right now because people are suffering through COVID. People are having complicated grief through COVID, with many families not being able to be with their loved one when they’re dying if they’re in a facility or in the hospital, with families not being able to do traditional funerals,” Lemon said. “We know our services are even more important right now. We thought it was so timely that the name go forward as quickly as possible to give that feeling of confidence that when you choose our services it’ll be helpful to you.” Share","[0.5839012861251831, 0.4160986840724945]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.5839012861251831

She said COVID-19 was a catalyst for the move..  “If you asked me 10 years ago, I would have told you the suburbs were the worst place ever. But we’re doing this for me and for my dogs,” said Frederking, who was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder about two years ago..  Advertisement A recent Pew Research Center study reported that around one in five Americans relocated this year due to COVID-19, and the most popular reason for relocating was to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19..  The demographic moving the most were those in the 18 to 29 age group, which includes younger millennials and their junior Gen Z cohorts. Next highest was the 30 to 45 group, comprised of older millennials and the tail end of Gen X..  Advertisement However, it’s still unclear if the national trend bears out for Chicago, and experts say it’s too soon to tell what the long-term impact will be for city real estate..  Over the past 50 years, Chicago has seen constant growth of its population of 25- to 34-year-olds, which is also the age group with the greatest net increase since 1970, according to U.S. Census data. By 2018, one in five Chicagoans were 25-34 — the largest percentage across age groups.","[0.665336012840271, 0.334663987159729]","['negative', 'positive']",negative,0.665336012840271
1489,"Why Illinois Has Bad Governance.  I think that RNC member Richard Porter’s piece at RealClearPolitics about how bad governance is driving the “Illinois Exodus”, Illinois’s constant and large loss of population, is largely right as far as it does:.  Illinois has a population problem: Our population has been shrinking faster than any other state (except one). The Chicago Tribune Editorial Board and others call this the Illinois Exodus..  Population changes are a measure of governance quality. We are free to choose where to live, and the United States offers 50 different states and thousands of different localities, each governed in different ways. People consider many factors when choosing where to live, and how a state is governed can be a significant factor in that decision. Over time, people migrate toward places that are governed well and away from areas that are governed poorly..  but it really doesn’t add a lot to the conversation..  The first quibble I’d make is that I don’t think that population changes are actually a measure of governance quality, at least not directly. I think that they’re more multi-factorial than that. All things equal everybody would live in Santa Barbara..  But all things are not equal and the cost of housing and the availability of jobs that pay enough to maintain the lifestyle that people expect to live can be greatly affected by government policy. Rather than being a measure of governance quality I think I might say that population changes are downstream of governance..  There are lots of different sorts of “bad governance”. All states have some, some states, e.g. Louisiana, have a lot, but few have as many different kinds as Illinois. Let’s consider some of them. Corruption.  Few states match Illinois for government corruption. In my lifetime alone four governors have done time after serving in office. Two of the last five Illinois governors have served time for corruption in office. That must be some sort of record. Then there’s Operation Greylord , Dan Rostenkowski and the Congressional Post Office scandal , and the ongoing probe of Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan’s shakedown of ComEd, just to name a very few. The list goes on and on. Fiscal Mismanagement.  Starting in the late 1990s and continuing through the first decade or so of the 21st century, the State of Illinois stopped paying into public pension funds. The governor and lawmakers had better uses for the money—increasing public employee pay and expanding Medicaid, for example—and rather than raising taxes which would have been too unpopular politically, they just stopped paying into the pension funds. Those needs were in the future. Well, the future is now and those things have a way of catching up with you. Now those pension funds have holes in them which nobody really knows how to fill..  Illinois has been borrowing money to pay its huge backlog of bills ferociously and it has the worst credit rating of any state. Mismatch of Policies and Needs.  This is a chronic problem in Illinois. I’ll just cite one example. The last mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, spent a lot of money on amenities for the “creative class” and not nearly enough on basic infrastructure, law enforcement, and the neighborhoods. Why? I think he had a misguided vision of Chicago as some sort of Midwestern San Francisco. He thought that he could attract prosperous upwardly mobile Millennials to Chicago that way. He was wrong. They don’t like Chicago’s weather, they don’t like its taxes, and there just aren’t enough jobs for those upwardly mobile Millennials..  I look at this tendency as a sort of inferiority complex on the part of our political leadership. They envy the “cool kids”—mayors of New York, San Francisco, Seattle, etc. Chicago will never be cool. Outlaw Government.  The Illinois Constitution requires that the state have a balanced budget. For several of the last few years Illinois has had no budget at all and the years of the last decade in which the budget has actually been balanced are few. How can the governor and the legislature get away with it? Nobody seems to have standing to sue them over it—it’s apparently an unenforceable regulation..  In addition Chicago in particular has been sued repeatedly for a variety of criminal conduct—mostly on the part of police. Nobody really believes that the mayor or the Cook County State’s Attorney were not involved but somehow they always get off scot free while the taxpayers are saddled with the bills for the judgments that are handed down.","[0.5008577704429626, 0.49914222955703735]","['positive', 'negative']",positive,0.5008577704429626

Thank you..  JCAR taking a look at proposed mask rule affecting businesses.  On Friday Governor Pritzker filed an emergency rule which would impose a Class A misdemeanor on businesses which do not enforce the state’s mask mandate on individuals in their place of business. Conviction of a Class A misdemeanor can result in a fine of up to $2500. The Joint Committee on Administrative Rules (JCAR) will review this rule on Tuesday. JCAR raised enough objections to a similar rule in May to stop it from going into effect..  All through the spring and summer I have called for the legislature and local leaders to be involved in making decisions regarding the state’s coronavirus response. This is another example of the kind of overreach that can occur when we have government-by-executive decree. This proposal affects every person in Illinois, and it should therefore be considered by their elected representatives, not done via an emergency rule..  Governor Pritzker should withdraw this unilateral order..  Members of the public may submit comments to JCAR via e-mail at JCAR@ilga.gov..  Emergency assistance available for rent.  Applications are open from today until August 21 for Illinoisans to apply for rental assistance from the Illinois Housing Development Authority.

State tax revenue up in July, mainly due to adjusted deadline.  As part of the coronavirus response, the Illinois Department of Revenue postponed the state’s tax filing deadline from April to July. Not surprisingly, the result was an increase in tax revenue collected in July 2020 compared to July 2019. Last month, tax revenue to the state was $2.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion compared to one year ago..  Overall, however, the state continues to be in difficult shape due to the worldwide economic downturn and our continued bad fiscal habits.
